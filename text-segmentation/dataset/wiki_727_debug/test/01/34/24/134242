========,2,History.
========,3,Source of the name "Etters".
The name "Etters", used by the USPS to refer to the post office in Goldsboro, comes from the establishment in 1838 of a post office inside a tavern owned by Henry Etter, a former Revolutionary War soldier, about a mile north of the current location of Goldsboro.
The post office was moved to Goldsboro in 1850, at which time it retained the name "Etter's" to avoid confusion with the already established post office in Gouldsboro, Wayne County, PA.
