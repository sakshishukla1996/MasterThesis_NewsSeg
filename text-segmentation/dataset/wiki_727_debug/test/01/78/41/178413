It is located in the traditional district of Nordfjord.

The rest of the lake lies inside neighboring Eid municipality.

Hornindal was part of the municipality of Stryn from 1965–1977, but was then separated again.
The European route E39 highway is being re-routed through Hornindal municipality to complete a ferry-free highway route along the western coast of Norway.

========,2,General information.
Since ancient times, Hornindal was a sub-parish "(sokn)" of Eid "prestegjeld" (see formannskapsdistrikt).
In 1865, Hornindal became a parish of its own and then two years later, on 1 January 1867, Hornindal was established as a separate municipality.
At this time, Hornindal had a population of 1,612.
On 1 January 1965, the municipality of Hornindal was dissolved and it was divided between the neighboring municipalities of Eid and Stryn.
Navelsaker and Holmøyvik and all of Hornindal west of there (population: 310) was transferred to Eid, and the 1,184 residents to the east of those areas went to Stryn.
On 1 January 1977, the municipality of Hornindal was separated from Stryn.
The portions of Hornindal that were moved to Eid in 1964 remained there.
The new municipality had a population of 1,202.
========,3,Name.
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the farm Horne (Old Norse "Hornvin"), since the first church (Hornindal Church) was built there.
The first element is "horn" which means "horn" (here referring to a pointed mountain behind the farm), the last element is "vin" which means "meadow" or "pasture".
So the meaning of the compounded name "Hornindal" is "the valley/dale of Horne".

Historically, farming and blacksmithing were vital industries in Hornindal.

There was also a rich tradition of making handmade scythes and this was very symbolized by putting scythes on the coat-of-arms.
