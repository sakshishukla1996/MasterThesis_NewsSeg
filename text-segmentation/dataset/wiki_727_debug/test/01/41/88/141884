========,1,preface.
Milton "Bill" Finger (February 8, 1914 – January 18, 1974) was an American comic strip and comic book writer best known as the co-creator, with Bob Kane, of the DC Comics character Batman, and the co-architect of the series' development.
Although Finger did not receive contemporaneous credit for his hand in the development of Batman, Kane acknowledged Finger's contributions years after Finger's death.
Finger also wrote many of the original 1940s Green Lantern stories after co-creating the original Green Lantern (Alan Scott), and would go on to contribute to the development of numerous other comic book series.
He was posthumously inducted into the comic book industry's Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1999.
His name provided the basis for the Bill Finger Award, founded by Jerry Robinson and presented annually at the San Diego Comic-Con International to honor excellence in comic book writing.
========,2,Early life.
Bill Finger was born in Denver, Colorado, to a Jewish family.
His father, Louis Finger (b.
1890, Austria), emigrated to the U.S. in 1907.
His mother Tessie (b. circa 1893, New York City) also gave birth to Bill Finger's sisters, Emily and Gilda.
The family moved to The Bronx, New York City, where during the Great Depression Louis Finger was forced to close his tailor shop.
Finger graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in The Bronx in 1933.
========,2,Career.
========,3,Comics.
An aspiring writer and a part-time shoe salesman, Finger joined Bob Kane's nascent studio in 1938 after having met Kane, a fellow DeWitt Clinton alumnus, at a party.
Kane later offered him a job ghost writing the strips "Rusty" and "Clip Carson".
========,4,Batman.
Early the following year, National Comics' success with the seminal superhero Superman in "Action Comics" prompted editors to scramble for similar heroes.
In response, Kane conceived "the Bat-Man".
Finger recalled Kane:
Finger offered such suggestions as giving the character a cowl instead of the domino mask, a cape instead of wings, adding gloves, and removing the red sections from the original costume.
He later said his suggestions were influenced by Lee Falk's popular "The Phantom", a syndicated newspaper comic strip character with which Kane was also familiar, and that he devised the name Bruce Wayne for the character's secret identity.
As Finger described, "Bruce Wayne's first name came from Robert Bruce, the Scottish patriot.
Wayne, being a playboy, was a man of gentry.
I searched for a name that would suggest colonialism.
I tried Adams, Hancock ... then I thought of Mad Anthony Wayne."
Kane decades later in his autobiography described Finger as "a contributing force on Batman right from the beginning...
I made Batman a superhero-vigilante when I first created him.
Bill turned him into a scientific detective."
Finger biographer Marc Tyler Nobleman described, "Bob [Kane] showed Bat-Man to [editor] Vin [Sullivan] — without Bill.
Vin promptly wanted to run Bat-Man, and Bob negotiated a deal — without including Bill."
Finger wrote both the initial script for Batman's debut in "Detective Comics" #27 (May 1939) and the character's second appearance, while Kane provided art.
Batman proved a breakout hit, and Finger went on to write many of the early Batman stories, including making major contributions to the Joker character.
Batman background artist and letterer George Roussos recalled:
Robin was introduced as Batman's sidekick in "Detective Comics" #38 (April 1940).
When Kane wanted Robin's origin to parallel Batman's, Finger made Robin's parents circus performers murdered while performing their trapeze act.
Finger recalled:
Comics historian Jim Steranko wrote in 1970 that Finger's slowness as a writer led Batman editor Whitney Ellsworth to suggest Kane replace him, a claim reflected in Joe Desris' description of Finger as "notoriously tardy".
During Finger's absence, Gardner Fox contributed scripts that introduced Batman's early "Bat-" arsenal (the utility belt, the Bat-Gyro/plane and the Batarang).
Upon his return, Finger created or co-created items such as the Batmobile and Batcave, and is credited with providing the name "Gotham City".
Finger wrote the debut issue of Batman's self-titled comic book series which introduced the Joker and the Catwoman.
Among the things that made his stories distinctive were a use of giant-sized props: enlarged pennies, sewing machines, or typewriters.
Two of the prevalently featured trophies in Batman's Batcave, a full-size animatronic Tyrannosaurus Rex and a giant replica of a Lincoln penny, were both introduced in stories written by Finger.
Eventually, Finger left Kane's studio to work directly for DC Comics, where he supplied scripts for characters including Batman and Superman.
A part of the Superman mythos which had originated on the radio program made its way into the comic books when kryptonite was featured in a story by Finger and Al Plastino in "Superman" #61 (Nov. 1949).
As writer of the "Superboy" series, Finger created Lana Lang, a love-interest for the teenage superhero.
Continuing his Batman work, he and artist Sheldon Moldoff introduced Ace the Bat-Hound in "Batman" #92 (June 1955), Bat-Mite in "Detective Comics" #267 (May 1959), Clayface in "Detective Comics" #298 (December 1961), and Betty Kane, the original Bat-Girl in "Batman" #139 (April 1961).
Finger wrote for other companies, including Fawcett Comics, Quality Comics and Marvel Comics' 1940s predecessor, Timely Comics.
========,4,Batman villains.
In 1994, Kane gave Finger co-credit for creating Batman's archnemesis the Joker, despite claims on the character by artist Jerry Robinson:
Robinson, whose original Joker playing card was on public display in the exhibition "Masters of American Comics" at the Jewish Museum in New York City, from September 16, 2006 to January 28, 2007, and the William Breman Jewish Heritage & Holocaust Museum in Atlanta, Georgia from October 24, 2004 to August 28, 2005, has countered that he created the Joker to be Batman's larger-than-life nemesis when extra stories needed to be written quickly for "Batman" #1 and that he received credit for the story in a college course.
Regarding the Conrad Veidt similarity, Robinson said:
The Penguin debuted in "Detective Comics" #58 (Dec. 1941).
According to Kane, he drew the Penguin after being inspired by the then advertising mascot of Kool cigarettes — a penguin with a top hat and cane.
Finger, however, claimed that he created the villain as a caricature of the aristocratic type, because "stuffy English gentlemen" reminded him of emperor penguins.
Kane introduced the Scarecrow and drew his first appearance, which was scripted by Finger.
Finger and Kane introduced Two-Face in "Detective Comics" #66 (Aug. 1942).
The Riddler was created by Finger and Dick Sprang in issue #140 (Oct. 1948).
The Calendar Man was another villain created by Finger without input from Kane.
========,4,Green Lantern.
Finger collaborated with artist and character creator Martin Nodell on the original Green Lantern, Alan Scott, who debuted in "All-American Comics" #16 (July 1940).
Both writer and artist received a byline on the strip, with Nodell in the earliest issues using the pseudonym "Matt Dellon".
According to Nodell, Finger was brought in to write scripts after Nodell had already conceived the character.
Nodell recalled in an undated, latter-day interview:
========,3,Screenwriter.
As a screenwriter, Finger wrote or co-wrote the films "Death Comes to Planet Aytin", "The Green Slime", and "Track of the Moon Beast", and contributed scripts to the TV series' "Hawaiian Eye" and "77 Sunset Strip".
He also cowrote a two-part episode "The Clock King's Crazy Crimes / The Clock King Gets Crowned", airing October 12–13, 1966, in season two of the live-action "Batman" TV series.
========,2,Credit.
Artist Bob Kane negotiated a contract with National Comics, the future DC Comics, that signed away ownership of the character in exchange for, among other compensations, a mandatory byline on all Batman comics (and adaptations thereof).
Finger's name, in contrast, does not appear as an official credit on Batman stories or films.
Finger began receiving limited acknowledgment for his writing work in the 1960s; the letters page of "Batman" #169 (Feb. 1965), for example, features editor Julius Schwartz naming Finger as creator of the Riddler.
Additionally, Finger did receive credit for his work for National's sister company, All-American Publications, during that time.
For example, the first Wildcat story, in "Sensation Comics" #1 (Jan. 1942), has the byline "by Irwin Hasen and Bill Finger", and the first Green Lantern story (see above) is credited to "Mart Dellon and Bill Finger".
National later absorbed All-American.
National's practice in the 1950s made formal bylines rare in comics, with DC regularly granting credit only to Kane; William Moulton Marston, creator of Wonder Woman, under his pseudonym of Charles Moulton; and to Sheldon Mayer.
In 1989, Kane acknowledged Finger as "a contributing force" in the character's creation, and wrote, "Now that my long-time friend and collaborator is gone, I must admit that Bill never received the fame and recognition he deserved.
He was an unsung hero ...
I often tell my wife, if I could go back fifteen years, before he died, I would like to say.
'I'll put your name on it now.
You deserve it.'"
Comics historian Ron Goulart has referred to Batman as the "creation of artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger".
Finger's contemporary, artist and writer Jerry Robinson, who worked with Kane from the beginning, said, “[Bill] had more to do with the molding of Batman than Bob.
He just did so many things at the beginning, ... creating almost all the other characters, ... the whole persona, the whole temper."
Batman inker George Roussos, another contemporary, said, "Bob Kane had ideas while Bill sort of organized them".
A DC Comics press release in 2007 said, "Kane, along with writer Bill Finger, had just created Batman for DC predecessor National Comics."
Likewise, DC editor Paul Levitz wrote, "The Darknight [sic] Detective debuted in ["Detective"] #27, the creation of Bob Kane and Bill Finger."
Writer John Broome and penciler Gil Kane created the comic-book villain William Hand, a.k.a.
Black Hand, as a tribute to Finger, on whom the character’s name and likeness were based.
In September 2015, DC Entertainment announced Finger would receive credit on the 2016 superhero film "" and the second season of "Gotham", following a deal between the Finger family and DC.
Finger received his first formal credit as a creator of Batman in the October 2015 comic books "Batman and Robin Eternal" #3 and "Batman: Arkham Knight Genesis" #3.
The updated acknowledgement for the character appeared as "Batman created by Bob Kane with Bill Finger".
========,2,Awards.
Finger was posthumously inducted into the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1999.
In 1985, DC Comics named Finger as one of the honorees in the company's 50th anniversary publication "Fifty Who Made DC Great".
In his honor, Comic-Con International established in 2005 the Bill Finger Award for Excellence in Comic Book Writing, which is given annually to "two recipients — one living and one deceased — who have produced a significant body of work in the comics field.
========,2,Personal life.
Finger was married twice.
He and his first wife Portia had a son Frederick.
After their divorce, Finger married Lyn Simmons in the late 1960s, but they were no longer married when he died in 1974.
Finger's friend Charles Sinclair found him dead at his home at the condominium Allen House at 340 East 51st Street in Manhattan, New York City, New York.
The cause of death was occlusive coronary atherosclerosis.
Finger had suffered three heart attacks: in 1963, 1970 and 1973.
Although it was long believed that Finger was buried in an unmarked potter's field grave, his body was claimed by his son Fred, who honored his wish to be cremated, and spread his ashes in the shape of a bat on a beach in Oregon.
Fred Finger, who was bisexual, died in 1992 from AIDS complications, but had a daughter, Athena, born two years after Bill Finger's death.
She and her son are Finger's only known living heirs, and as such she successfully challenged Warner Brothers to credit Finger as co-creator of Batman.
