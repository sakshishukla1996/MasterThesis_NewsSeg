========,1,preface.
The Eurovision Song Contest 1965 was the tenth edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest.
It was held in Naples, Italy, following the Italian victory at the previous 1964 edition.
Luxembourg won, for the second time in the history of the contest, with the song "Poupée de cire, poupée de son", performed by France Gall and composed by Serge Gainsbourg.
Belgium, Finland, Germany, and Spain each scored "null points" for the second time.
The 1965 contest marked the debut of Ireland, a country which later went on to dominate the competition.
This was also the first contest with over 16 countries participating with a total of 18 entries.
The Swedish entry was also sung in English.
For the first time since Dutch victory 'Een Beetje' in 1959, the winning song was not a ballad.
========,2,Location.
The contest took place in Naples, the capital of region Campania in southern Italy and the third-largest city in Italy, after Rome and Milan.
This is Italy's first hosting of the Eurovision Song Contest.
The host venue was the then new Sala di Concerto della RAI ("RAI Production Centre of Naples"), founded few years prior to the contest, in the late fifties and early sixties.
It is located in Viale Marconi in the district of Fuorigrotta.
The structure has three TV studios for a total of 1227 m² and capacity of 370 persons, used for the filming of programs and fiction and an auditorium.
The Neapolitan song archives are also housed in it.
========,2,Format.
Each country had 10 jury members who distributed three points among their one, two, or three favourite songs.
The points were totalled and the first, second, and third placed songs were awarded 5, 3, and 1 votes in order.
If only one song got every point within the jury it would get all 9 points.
If only two songs were chosen, the songs would get 6 and 3 points in order.
========,2,Participating countries.
18 countries took part, with the Eurovision Song Contest reaching its highest ever number.
Sweden returned after a one-year absence, and Ireland debuted in the competition.
Luxembourg won for the second time with the highly controversial Poupée De Cire, Poupée De Son sung by teenager France Gall which later went on to be a massive hit in almost all European countries.
Belgium, Finland, Germany, and Spain all scored null points for the second time.
The competition was also broadcast via the Intervision network, to the Eastern European nations for the very first time.
Ingvar Wixell, the Swedish participant performed his song in English instead of the original Swedish title "Annorstädes vals".
The native languages were used for all of the other participants.
This led to a rule being introduced for the next 1966 edition, that meant all participants had to perform their songs using one of their national languages.
