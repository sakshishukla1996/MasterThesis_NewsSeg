========,2,History.
Gallatin was established in 1802 as the permanent county seat of Sumner County, Tennessee, in what is called the Middle Tennessee region.
The town was named after Albert Gallatin, Secretary of Treasury to presidents Thomas Jefferson and James Madison.
Andrew Jackson became one of the first to purchase a lot when the town was surveyed and platted in 1803.
The town was built around a traditional plan of an open square.
Jackson founded the first general store in Gallatin.
In 1803 the first courthouse and jail were built on the central town square.
In 1815, the town was first incorporated.
In the mid-20th century, it operated under a Charter established by a 1953 Private Act of the State Legislature.
During the secession crisis just prior to the Civil War, the citizens of Gallatin hoped to remain neutral and were opposed to secession from the Union.
Once the fighting began, however, they gave almost unanimous support to the Confederacy and volunteered to serve in defense of their state.
The Union Army captured Gallatin in February 1862, following Ulysses S. Grant's capture of Fort Donelson.
Gallatin was strategic because of the railroad and its location on the Cumberland River, both of which the Union Army sought to control.
In July 1862, General John Hunt Morgan recaptured Gallatin and held it until the Confederate forces fell back to Chattanooga in October.
In November 1862, Union general Eleazar A. Paine retook the town and Union troops occupied it throughout the remainder of the war.
Paine was notoriously cruel and was replaced in command before the end of the war.
In her diary, a 16-year-old Alice Williamson described Paine's execution of alleged spies in the town square.
Following the Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863, slaves fled to the Union troops, who established a "contraband camp" at Gallatin.
The slaves were fed and housed and put to work.
Schools were set up in the camp so that both adults and children could learn to read and write.
The long enemy occupation drained the area of resources.
Union troops lived off the land, confiscating livestock and crops from local farms.
By the end of the war, there was widespread social and economic breakdown and dislocation in the area, accompanied by a rise in crime.
Occupation forces of the Union Army remained in Gallatin for some time after the war, still living off the land.
In the aftermath of the war, many freedmen moved from the farms into town.
At the same time, many white citizens moved from town out to farms to avoid the occupying troops.
The area took many years to recover from the disruption of the war years, continued reliance on agriculture, and shift to a free labor system.
In the summer of 1873 Gallatin was devastated by an epidemic of cholera.
In the single month of June, 68 people died, including many children.
The disease swept through the South, brought by immigrants arriving in New Orleans, and spread by passengers traveling by steamboat and rail.
Nashville had 603 fatal cases from June 7–29, with 72 people dying on the day of most fatalities.
Gradually through the late 19th century, Gallatin and its surroundings regained some steady growth.
The area was primarily agricultural until the middle of the 20th century.
By 1970, industrialization resulted in only half of the county population being considered rural.
In 1992, Gallatin was surpassed by Hendersonville as the largest town in the county, though the former remains the county seat.
Today it serves in part as a bedroom commuter suburb to the larger city and state capital of Nashville, Tennessee, some 30.6 miles to the southwest.
In April 7, 2006, a tornado struck the city, killing nine people and injuring 150.
Volunteer State Community College sustained major damage.
This tornado was part of the April 6–8, 2006 Tornado Outbreak.
