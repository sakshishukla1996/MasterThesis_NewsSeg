Out of the Cellar is the debut studio album by the American heavy metal band Ratt.
Released in 1984, it was an immediate success, with wide airplay on radio and heavy rotation on MTV of its singles, especially the decade-defining "Round and Round".
The album is certified as triple platinum by the RIAA.
The album brought Ratt, originally from San Diego, California, to the top of the glam metal scene in Los Angeles.
Ratt's later work would never surpass the success of "Out of the Cellar".
According to interviews with Beau Hill that were shot for the film "Hair I Go Again", Tom Allom was originally slated to produce the record, before the novice Hill was brought in.
========,2,Songs.
Produced by Beau Hill, "Out of the Cellar" features Ratt's best-known hit, "Round and Round".
It also contains other popular songs such as "Wanted Man", "Lack of Communication" and a re-recorded version of "Back for More".
The latter song originally appeared on the EP "Ratt".
"In Your Direction" was a song that Pearcy wrote when the band was still called Mickey Ratt; "I'm Insane" and "Scene of the Crime" were songs Crosby had co-written and performed with his pre-Ratt band, Mac Meda, featuring future Riverdogs vocalist Rob Lamothe.
In 2008, "Round and Round" and "I'm Insane" were featured in "The Wrestler".
"Wanted Man" was co-written by bassist Joey Cristofanilli, who had briefly substituted Juan Croucier.
