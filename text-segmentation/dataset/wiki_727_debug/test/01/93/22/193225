In 1986 and 1987, Fuji TV worked with Nintendo to create two games called "All Night Nippon Super Mario Bros." and ' for the Famicom.
All Night Nippon Super Mario Bros. was a retooled version of "Super Mario Bros." with some minor changes, such as normal levels being replaced with levels from ' and some enemies being replaced with Japanese celebrities with comedic effect. ""

In October 1987, Fuji TV began branding their late-night/early-morning slots collectively as (meaning "alternative JOCX-TV") in an effort to market the traditionally unprofitable time slots and give opportunities to young creators to express their new ideas.
JOCX-TV2 featured numerous experimental programs on low budgets under this and follow-on brands, a notable example being "Zuiikin' English" which first aired in spring 1992.

The JOCX-MIDNIGHT branding was introduced in October 1993 to replace the previous JUNGLE branding, and lasted until March 1996 when Fuji TV decided to stop branding their late-night/early-morning slots.

========,2,Controversies.
On August 7-21, 2011, more than 2,000 protesters from Japanese Culture Channel Sakura and other extremist groups rallied in front of Fuji Television and Fuji Media Holdings' headquarters in Odaiba, Tokyo to demonstrate against what they perceived as the network's increased use of Korean content, information manipulation and insulting treatment of Japanese people.
Channel Sakura called Fuji TV the "Traitor Network" in these protests.
Further on June 29, 2015, Fuji TV apologized for running subtitles during a show earlier in the month that inaccurately described South Koreans interviewed on the street as saying they “hate” Japan.
The apology came after a successful online petition over the weekend, with people stating the major broadcaster had fabricated the subtitles to breed anti-Korea sentiment amongst the Japanese public.
Fuji TV explained that both interviewees indeed spoke of their dislike of Japan during the interviews, but it accidentally ran clips that didn’t contain that message.
According to the broadcaster, “we aired these inaccurate clips because of a mix-up during the editing process as well as our failure to check the final footage sufficiently.”
