========,3,Utah Data Center.
The Utah Data Center, also known as the Intelligence Community Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative Data Center, is a data storage facility for the United States Intelligence Community that is designed to be a primary storage resource capable of storing data on the scale of yottabytes (1 yottabyte = 1 trillion terabytes, or 1 quadrillion gigabytes).
Its purpose – as the name implies – is to support the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI), including storing details of people's mobile phone and internet use, though its precise mission is secret.
The National Security Agency (NSA), which will lead operations at the facility, is the executive agent for the Director of National Intelligence.
It is located at Camp Williams.
The planned structure is 1 million or 1.5 million square feet and cost $1.5 billion when it was completed in May 2014.
One report suggested that it also cost another $2 billion for hardware, software, and maintenance.
The facility is estimated to have a power demand of 65 megawatts, costing about $40 million per year.
