========,1,preface.
In geometry, an equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal.
In the familiar Euclidean geometry, equilateral triangles are also equiangular; that is, all three internal angles are also congruent to each other and are each 60°.
They are regular polygons, and can therefore also be referred to as regular triangles.
========,2,Principal properties.
Denoting the common length of the sides of the equilateral triangle as "a", we can determine using the Pythagorean theorem that:
***LIST***.
Denoting the radius of the circumscribed circle as "R", we can determine using trigonometry that:
***LIST***.
Many of these quantities have simple relationships to the altitude ("h") of each vertex from the opposite side:
***LIST***.
In an equilateral triangle, the altitudes, the angle bisectors, the perpendicular bisectors and the medians to each side coincide.
========,2,Characterizations.
A triangle "ABC" that has the sides "a", "b", "c", semiperimeter "s", area "T", exradii "r", "r", "r" (tangent to "a", "b", "c" respectively), and where "R" and "r" are the radii of the circumcircle and incircle respectively, is equilateral if and only if any one of the statements in the following nine categories is true.
Thus these are properties that are unique to equilateral triangles.
========,3,Coincident triangle centers.
Every triangle center of an equilateral triangle coincides with its centroid, which implies that the equilateral triangle is the only triangle with no Euler line connecting some of the centers.
For some pairs of triangle centers, the fact that they coincide is enough to ensure that the triangle is equilateral.
In particular:
***LIST***.
========,2,Notable theorems.
Morley's trisector theorem states that, in any triangle, the three points of intersection of the adjacent angle trisectors form an equilateral triangle.
Napoleon's theorem states that, if equilateral triangles are constructed on the sides of any triangle, either all outward, or all inward, the centers of those equilateral triangles themselves form an equilateral triangle.
A version of the isoperimetric inequality for triangles states that the triangle of greatest area among all those with a given perimeter is equilateral.
Viviani's theorem states that, for any interior point "P" in an equilateral triangle with distances "d", "e", and "f" from the sides and altitude "h", independent of the location of "P".
Pompeiu's theorem states that, if "P" is an arbitrary point in an equilateral triangle "ABC", then there exists a triangle with sides of lengths "PA", "PB", and "PC".
That is, "PA", "PB", and "PC" satisfy the triangle inequality that any two of them sum to at least as great as the third.
========,2,Geometric construction.
An equilateral triangle is easily constructed using a compass and straightedge, as 3 is a Fermat prime.
Draw a straight line, and place the point of the compass on one end of the line, and swing an arc from that point to the other point of the line segment.
Repeat with the other side of the line.
Finally, connect the point where the two arcs intersect with each end of the line segment An alternative method is to draw a circle with radius "r", place the point of the compass on the circle and draw another circle with the same radius.
The two circles will intersect in two points.
An equilateral triangle can be constructed by taking the two centers of the circles and either of the points of intersection.
In both methods a by-product is the formation of vesica piscis.
The proof that the resulting figure is an equilateral triangle is the first proposition in Book I of Euclid's Elements.
========,2,Derivation of area formula.
========,3,Using the Pythagorean theorem.
The area of a triangle is half of one side "a" times the height "h" from that side:
The legs of either right triangle formed by an altitude of the equilateral triangle are half of the base "a", and the hypotenuse is the side "a" of the equilateral triangle.
The height of an equilateral triangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem so that Substituting "h" into the area formula (1/2)"ah" gives the area formula for the equilateral triangle:
========,3,Using trigonometry.
Using trigonometry, the area of a triangle with any two sides "a" and "b", and an angle "C" between them is Each angle of an equilateral triangle is 60°, so The sine of 60° is ***formula***.
Thus since all sides of an equilateral triangle are equal.
