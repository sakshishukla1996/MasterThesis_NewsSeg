In mathematics, a dihedral group is the group of symmetries of a regular polygon, which includes rotations and reflections.
Dihedral groups are among the simplest examples of finite groups, and they play an important role in group theory, geometry, and chemistry.
The notation for the dihedral group of order differs in geometry and abstract algebra.
In geometry, or refers to the symmetries of the n-gon, a group of order .
In abstract algebra, refers to the dihedral group of order .
The geometric convention is used in this article.
========,2,Definition.
========,3,Group structure.
As with any geometric object, the composition of two symmetries of a regular polygon is again a symmetry of this object.
With composition of symmetries to produce another as the binary operation, this gives the symmetries of a polygon the algebraic structure of a finite group.
The following Cayley table shows the effect of composition in the group D (the symmetries of an equilateral triangle).
r denotes the identity; r and r denote counterclockwise rotations by 120° and 240° respectively, and s, s and s denote reflections across the three lines shown in the adjacent picture.
For example, , because the reflection s followed by the reflection s results in a rotation of 120°.
The order of elements denoting the composition is right to left, reflecting the convention that the element acts on the expression to its right.
The composition operation is not commutative.
In general, the group D has elements r, …, r and s, …, s, with composition given by the following formulae:
In all cases, addition and subtraction of subscripts are to be performed using modular arithmetic with modulus "n".
========,3,Matrix representation.
If we center the regular polygon at the origin, then elements of the dihedral group act as linear transformations of the plane.
This lets us represent elements of D as matrices, with composition being matrix multiplication.
This is an example of a (2-dimensional) group representation.
For example, the elements of the group D can be represented by the following eight matrices:
In general, the matrices for elements of D have the following form:
r is a rotation matrix, expressing a counterclockwise rotation through an angle of .
s is a reflection across a line that makes an angle of with the "x"-axis.
========,2,Small dihedral groups.
 is isomorphic to , the cyclic group of order 2.
***LIST***.
The cycle graphs of dihedral groups consist of an "n"-element cycle and "n" 2-element cycles.
The dark vertex in the cycle graphs below of various dihedral groups represents the identity element, and the other vertices are the other elements of the group.
A cycle consists of successive powers of either of the elements connected to the identity element.
========,2,Properties.
The properties of the dihedral groups with depend on whether is even or odd.
For example, the center of consists only of the identity if "n" is odd, but if "n" is even the center has two elements, namely the identity and the element "r" (with D as a subgroup of O(2), this is inversion; since it is scalar multiplication by −1, it is clear that it commutes with any linear transformation).
In the case of 2D isometries, this corresponds to adding inversion, giving rotations and mirrors in between the existing ones.
For "n" twice an odd number, the abstract group is isomorphic with the direct product of and .
Generally, if "m" divides "n", then has "n"/"m" subgroups of type , and one subgroup ℤ.
Therefore, the total number of subgroups of ("n" ≥ 1), is equal to "d"("n") + σ("n"), where "d"("n") is the number of positive divisors of "n" and σ("n") is the sum of the positive divisors of "n".
See list of small groups for the cases "n" ≤ 8.
The dihedral group of order 8 (D) is the smallest example of a group that is not a T-group.
Any of its two Klein four-group subgroups (which are normal in D) has as normal subgroup order-2 subgroups generated by a reflection (flip) in D, but these subgroups are not normal in D.
========,3,Conjugacy classes of reflections.
All the reflections are conjugate to each other in case "n" is odd, but they fall into two conjugacy classes if "n" is even.
If we think of the isometries of a regular "n"-gon: for odd "n" there are rotations in the group between every pair of mirrors, while for even "n" only half of the mirrors can be reached from one by these rotations.
Geometrically, in an odd polygon every axis of symmetry passes through a vertex and a side, while in an even polygon there are two sets of axes, each corresponding to a conjugacy class: those that pass through two vertices and those that pass through two sides.
Algebraically, this is an instance of the conjugate Sylow theorem (for "n" odd): for "n" odd, each reflection, together with the identity, form a subgroup of order 2, which is a Sylow 2-subgroup ( is the maximum power of 2 dividing ), while for "n" even, these order 2 subgroups are not Sylow subgroups because 4 (a higher power of 2) divides the order of the group.
For "n" even there is instead an outer automorphism interchanging the two types of reflections (properly, a class of outer automorphisms, which are all conjugate by an inner automorphism).
========,2,Automorphism group.
The automorphism group of is isomorphic to the holomorph of ℤ/nℤ, i.e., to and has order nϕ(n), where ϕ is Euler's totient function, the number of "k" in coprime to "n".
It can be understood in terms of the generators of a reflection and an elementary rotation (rotation by k(2π/n), for "k" coprime to "n"); which automorphisms are inner and outer depends on the parity of "n".
***LIST***.
========,3,Examples of automorphism groups.
 has 18 inner automorphisms.
As 2D isometry group D, the group has mirrors at 20° intervals.
The 18 inner automorphisms provide rotation of the mirrors by multiples of 20°, and reflections.
As isometry group these are all automorphisms.
As abstract group there are in addition to these, 36 outer automorphisms; e.g., multiplying angles of rotation by 2.
Compare the values 6 and 4 for Euler's totient function, the multiplicative group of integers modulo n for "n" = 9 and 10, respectively.
This triples and doubles the number of automorphisms compared with the two automorphisms as isometries (keeping the order of the rotations the same or reversing the order).
The only values of "n" for which φ(n) = 2 are 3, 4, and 6, and consequently, there are only three dihedral groups that are isomorphic to their own automorphism groups, namely (order 6), (order 8), and (order 12).
