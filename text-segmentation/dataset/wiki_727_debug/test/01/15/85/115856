========,1,preface.
Lewiston ( , ; officially the City of Lewiston, Maine) is the second largest city in Maine and the most central city in Androscoggin County.
The city has a population of 36,202 and has a population of 1,071 per square mile, making it one of the least densely populated in Maine as of 2015.
Located in south-western Maine, the city borders the coastal sideways of the Gulf of Maine and is south of Augusta, the state's capital and north of Portland, the cultural hub of Maine.
It is one-half of the Lewiston-Auburn Metropolitan Statistical Area, commonly referred to as "L.A." or "L-A."
Lewiston exerts a significant impact upon the diversity, religious variety, commerce, education, and economic power of Maine.
It is known for a relatively low cost of living, substantial access to medical care, and an extremely low violent crime rate.
While the dominant language spoken in the city is English, it is home to the largest French-speaking population in the state; the language is spoken by nearly 15% of locals.
With a total of 2,441 business establishments, the city has a service-based tertiary economy worth approximately $4.1 billion in gross domestic product (GDP) output, primarily in the natural resources, mining, finance, insurance, real estate, rental/leasing, transportation, and utilities sectors.
The influx of Somali and Bantu immigrants has created a secondary goods-manufacturing economy that supplements economic growth.
The spread of globailzation and capital/labor flight has made the economy of Lewiston small-scale, underdeveloped, and growing.
Although 63.3% of the population composes the labour force, 23.2% of the permanent population (excluding college students and those visiting) live in poverty with an average income of $37,500.
The Lewiston area traces its roots to 1669 with the early presence of the Androscoggin tribe (the namesake of the county the city resides in).
In the late 18th century, the area slowly became populated by New French families and was incorporated as "Lewistown" in 1795.
The presence of the Androscoggin River and Lewistown Falls made the town an attractive area for manufacturing and hydro-power businesses.
The rise of Boston rail and textile tycoon Benjamin Bates saw rapid economic growth rivaling that of Cambridge, Worcester, and Concord.
The increase in economic stimulus prompted thousands of Québécois to migrate causing a population boom; the populace rose from 1,801 in 1840 to 21,701 in 1890.
During the mid-19th century, Lewistown was the wealthiest, and most rapidly growing city in Maine and began to develop a distinct upper-class in the Frye Street District.
The Bates Mills (numbered 1-5) employed thousands of Lewistown locals, Canadians, and Europeans maintaining itself as the largest employer for three decades.
The town's reationship with Bates was strained with the 1861 Lewistown cotton riots, but gradually improved over time during the American Civil War.
During the war, local preacher Oren Burbank Cheney founded the Maine State Seminary, the first coeducational university in New England and one of the first universities to admit black students before the Emancipation Proclamation.
Lewistown quickly became associated with the liberal arts and was incorporated as "Lewiston" in 1864, a year before the college was chartered as Bates College.
The mid-20th century saw the expansion of textile investments and the 5,000-person Lewiston-Auburn Shoe Strike of 1937.
Lewiston was the final stop of John F. Kennedy before he assumed his presidency; he spoke at a park now known as "Kennedy Park."
It was also the site of the 1965 Muhammid Ali "vs" Sonny Liston rematch, where the was taken.
The city is home to the only basilica in Maine, Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul, 15 colleges and universities, 44 listings on the National Register of Historic Places, the Androscoggin Bank Colisée, the Stephens Observatory, the Olin Arts Center, the Bates College Museum of Art (BCMoA) and two significant general hospitals: Central Maine Medical Center and Saint Mary's Regional Medical Center.
Lewiston hosts the Bates Dance Festival, the Patrick Dempsey Challenge, Liberty Festival, Festival FrancoFun, The Great Falls Balloon Festival, and the Emerge Film Festival.
========,2,History.
========,3,Conception.
The Lewiston area was formerly inhabited by peoples of the Androscoggin (or Arosaguntacook) tribe.
The Androscoggins were a tribe of the Abenaki nation.
Facing annihilation from English attacks and epidemics of new infectious diseases, the Androscoggins started to emigrate to Quebec "circa" 1669.
They were driven out of the area in 1680, sometime after King Philip's War (1675-1676).
The governor of New France allocated two seigneuries on the Saint Francis River which is now known as the Odanak Indian Reservation; and the second was founded near Bécancour and is called the Wolinak Indian Reservation.
========,3,Colonial beginnings.
A grant comprising the area of Lewiston was given to Moses Little and Jonathan Bagley, members of the Pejepscot Proprieters, on January 28, 1768 on the condition that fifty families lived in the area before June 1, 1774.
Bagley and Little named the new town Lewistown.
Paul Hildreth was the first man to settle in Lewiston in the fall of 1770.
By 1795, Lewiston was officially incorporated as a town.
At least four houses that have survived from this period are currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
King Avenue and Ralph Avenue were named after Ralph Luthor King, who owned the land located near the fairgrounds.
Elliott Avenue was named after his wife, Grace O. Elliott, whose son eventually built the family home at 40 Wellman Street.
========,3,Industrial development and Benjamin Bates.
Lewiston was a slow but steadily growing farm town throughout its early history.
By the early-to-mid-19th century, however, as water power was being honed, Lewiston's location on the Androscoggin River would prove to make it a perfect location for emerging industry.
In 1809, Michael Little built a large wooden sawmill next to the falls.
Burned in 1814 by an arsonist, it was later rebuilt.
In 1836, local entrepreneurs—predominantly the Little family and friends—formed the Androscoggin Falls Dam, Lock & Canal Company:...for the purpose of erecting and constructing dams, locks, canals, mills, works, machines, and buildings on their own lands and also manufacturing cotton, wool, iron, steel, and paper in the towns of Lewiston, Minot, and Danville.
The sales of stock attracted Boston investors—including Thomas J. Hill, Lyman Nichols, George L. Ward and Alexander De Witt.
De Witt convinced textile and rail tycoon Benjamin Bates, then-President of the Union Pacific Railroad to come to Lewiston and fund the emerging Lewiston Water Power Company.
Soon after Bates arrived the company created the first canal in the city.
Impressed with the labor force and "working spirit" of the Lewistonions, Bates founded the Bates Manufacturing Company leading to the construction of 5 mills starting with Bates Mill No.
In August 1850, Maine Governor John Hubbard signed the incorporation act and the mill was completed 1852.
Bates positioned the mill in Lewiston due to the location of the Lewiston Falls which provided the mill with power.
Under Bates' supervision, during the Civil War, the mill produced textiles to the Union Army.
His mills generated employment for thousands of Canadians, and immigrants from Europe.
The mill was Maine's largest employer for three decades.This began the transformation from a small farming town into a textile manufacturing center on the model of Lowell, Massachusetts.
The creation of the Bates manufuacturing trusts saw rapid economic growth, positioning the city as the weathiest city in Maine, and created budding affluent district such as the Main Street–Frye Street Historic District.
Although the odd-majority of the population was working class, a distinctive upper class was emerged at this time.
The Bates Mill remained the largest employer in Lewiston from the 1850s to the mid-late 20th century.In 1853, the Grand Trunk Railway was built, connecting Maine to the St. Lawrence River, Montreal, and the Canadian Maritimes, and making Portland the winter port for Canadian trade.
Subsequently, trains connected Quebec with Lewiston on a daily schedule.
During the Civil War, the high demand for textiles helped Lewiston develop a strong industrial base through the Bates Enterprise.
However, the concentration of wealth in Benjamin Bates sparked the 1861 Lewiston cotton riots which prompted him to give thousands of dollars back to the city and expand the employment opportunities at his mills.
In 1861, a flood of French-Canadian immigration into Maine began, spawned by industrial work opportunities in Maine cities with water power from waterfalls.
This brought a significant influx of Québécois millworkers that replaced the former Yankee millgirls.
Lewiston's population boomed between 1840 and 1890 from 1,801 to 21,701.
Canadiens settled in an area downtown that became known as Little Canada, and Lewiston's character has remained largely Franco-American ever since.
In 1855, Maine preacher traveled from Parsnfield to Lewiston to establish is institution of higher learning in the city.
In 1855, the Maine State Legislature was petitioned by Lewiston locals to found the Maine State Seminary.
The school opened in 1855, was educated the working class of Maine while also providing education for blacks and women at a time when other universities barred the activity.
At its founding it became the first coeducational college in the United States and one of the earliest proponents of abolitionism.
During this time, in 1863, Lewiston was incorporated as a city.
In 1872, St. Peter's church was built in Lewiston.
This was the first French-Canadian national church in Maine.
In 1864, the Maine State Seminary was renamed Bates College in honor of Benjamin Bates.
In 1880, "Le Messager", a French language newspaper, began printing in Lewiston to serve its predominant ethnic population.
The local Kora Shrine was organized in 1891 and held its first meetings in a Masonic temple on Lisbon Street.
This group would from 1908 to 1910 build the Kora Temple on Sabattus Street, the largest home of a fraternal organization in the state.
Architect George M. Coombs designed this Moorish style structure.
City leaders decided to build a cathedral in which the Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland could relocate.
Construction of the Church of Saints Peter and Paul began in 1905 and ended in 1938, mostly funded through thousands of small donations from Lewiston residents.
It is the largest Roman Catholic Church in Maine, and Lewiston's most prominent landmark.
While the Diocese of Portland did not relocate to Lewiston, the church nevertheless became a basilica in 2004.
It is one of the few American basilicas located outside of a major metropolitan area.
========,3,Lewiston-Auburn Shoe Strike.
In 1937, one of the largest labor disputes in Maine history occurred in Lewiston and Auburn.
The Lewiston-Auburn Shoe Strike lasted from March to June and at its peak involved 4,000 to 5,000 workers on strike.
After workers attempted to march across the Androscoggin River from Lewiston to Auburn, Governor Lewis Barrows sent in the Maine Army National Guard.
Some labor leaders, CIO Secretary Powers Hapgood, were imprisoned for months after a Maine Supreme Judicial Court judge issued an injunction seeking to end the strike.
========,3,Textile investment.
After World War I, profits from the textile industry in New England mill towns such as Lewiston, Biddeford, Manchester, New Hampshire, Waterbury, Connecticut, and Fall River, Haverhill, Lawrence and Lowell, Massachusetts began to decline.
Businesses began moving to the South due to lower costs of power from more modern technologies (Lewiston's water wheel technology gave way to hydroelectricity, cheaper transportation (as most cotton and materials came from the South), and cheaper labor).
Starting in the late 1950s, many of Lewiston's textile mills began closing.
This gradually led to a run-down and abandoned downtown area.
Chain stores previously located downtown—Woolworth's, W. T. Grant, S. S. Kresge, JC Penney and Sears Roebuck—shut their doors or moved to malls on the outskirts of Lewiston or Auburn.
The city's flagship department store, the four-story B. Peck & Co., closed in 1982 after more than a century in business.
As businesses and jobs began to leave the city, people followed.
The population stopped increasing at its previous rate and began to slowly decline after 1970, then at a greater rate in the 1990s.
========,3,Economic diversification and renaissance.
Following a difficult economic period in the 1980s that saw high unemployment and downtown stagnation, several key events have led to a period of economic and cultural growth, including the transformation of the historic Bates Mill Complex.
Because the city took over the complex in 1992 after back taxes went unpaid, years of taxpayer frustration in the city's need to maintain the behemoth led to two referenda (one non-binding vote, the other binding).
Voters soundly supported the need to pursue redevelopment by maintaining the property and selling it to private developers.
In 2001, the city sold three mill buildings to local developers.
In 2003, Platz Associates sold the Bates Mill Complex, with the exception of Mill 5 and a small support building.
For the next four years, a number of business enterprises expanded after Platz redeveloped the mill building.
The Bates Mill complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in December 2010.
In May 2004, the city officials announced a plan for urban renewal near the downtown area.
The plan was to demolish several blocks of 19th-century millworker housing, lay new streets with updated infrastructure, construct more owner-occupied, lower-density housing, and build a boulevard through one neighborhood using federal Community Development Block Grant funds provided over a period of ten years.
Some residents of the affected neighborhoods felt that the plan was initially announced with little input from them.
They formed a neighborhood group called "The Visible Community", which has since been actively involved in the planning process, and resulted in cooperation between neighbors and city officials to redesign Kennedy Park, including input on the location of new basketball courts, and feedback regarding creation of the largest all-concrete skate park in Maine.
Downtown is home to a new headquarters for Oxford Networks, along with a $20 million upgrade in local fiber-optics, a new auto parts store, a campus of the for-profit Kaplan University, the headquarters for Northeast Bank, a parking garage, and the newly renovated Maine Supply Co. building, listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
That facility is now called the Business Service Center at Key Bank Plaza, and is home to the local Chamber of Commerce, the Lewiston-Auburn Economic Growth Council, and an arrangement with a number of business service providers.
The area's renaissance has gained local, regional, and national recognition.
In 2002 and again in 2006, the L-A area led the state in economic development activity, according to the Maine Department of Economic and Community Development's list of business investments and expansions.
In a 2006 KPMG International study measuring the cost of locating and maintaining a business, Lewiston ranked first among the New England communities analyzed, and finished 24th out of 49 U.S. communities analyzed.
Lewiston earned a 2007 All-America City Award designation by the National Civic League.
The national competition "recognizes communities whose residents work together to identify and tackle community-wide challenges and achieve measurable, uncommon results."
10 cities are selected as All-America Cities each year.
In 2017, Forbes Magazine named Lewiston one of its top 25 places to retire, citing relatively low cost of living, good access to medical care, and extremely low violent crime rate.
========,3,Somali and Bantu migration.
In 1999, the United States government began preparations to resettle an estimated 12,000 refugees from the Bantu minority ethnic group in Somalia to select cities throughout the United States.
Most of the early arrivals in the United States settled in Clarkston, Georgia, a city adjacent to Atlanta.
However, they were mostly assigned to low rent, poverty-stricken inner city areas, so many began to look to resettle elsewhere in the U.S.Word soon spread that Lewiston had a low crime rate, good schools and cheap housing.
Somalis subsequently began a secondary migration from other states to the former mill town, and after 2005, many Bantus followed suit.
In October 2002, then-Mayor Laurier T. Raymond wrote an open letter addressed to leaders of the Somali community, predicting a negative impact on the city's social services and requesting that they discourage further relocation to Lewiston.
The letter angered some persons and prompted some community leaders and residents to speak out against the mayor, drawing national attention.
Demonstrations were held in Lewiston, both by those who supported the immigrants' presence and those who opposed it.
In January 2003, about 32 members of a white supremacist group from Illinois demonstrated in Lewiston to denounce Somali immigrants.
This prompted a simultaneous counter-demonstration on the campus of Bates College to demonstrate support of the Somali community.
The rally repudiating the white supremacists attracted 4,000 attendees, including governor John Baldacci, Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins and other officials.
Mayor Raymond was reportedly out of town on vacation on the day of the protests.
In August 2010, the "Lewiston Sun Journal" reported that Somali entrepreneurs had helped reinvigorate downtown Lewiston by opening shops in previously closed storefronts.
Amicable relations were also reported by the local Franco-American merchants and the Somali storekeepers.
========,2,Geography.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.
Lewiston is drained by the Androscoggin River, which is located on its western border.
The city is bordered by Auburn beyond the river, as well as the towns of Greene, Sabattus, and Lisbon.
It is located between Portland, the state's biggest city and cultural center, and the state capital of Augusta.
========,3,Neighborhoods.
========,4,Downtown.
Downtown Lewiston runs from Oxford Street up to Jefferson Street, and from Adams Avenue to Main Street.
This is the most densely settled area of the city, home to about half the population.
It contains mostly housing, although on Lisbon Street and Main Street, it is entirely businesses.
This neighborhood was once the commercial hub of the whole county, but with the city's economic decline, many downtown stores closed and the former mill housing became run-down, resulting in fallen land values.
But like many post-industrial centers, there has followed a period of renovation and revitalization that continues today.
This neighborhood includes:
