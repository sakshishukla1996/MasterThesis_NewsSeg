========,1,preface.
Yunnan is a province of the People's Republic of China, located in the far southwest of the country.
It spans approximately and has a population of 45.7 million in 2009.
The capital of the province is Kunming, formerly also known as Yunnan.
The province borders Vietnam, Laos, and Burma.
Yunnan is situated in a mountainous area, with high elevations in the northwest and low elevations in the southeast.
Most of the population lives in the eastern part of the province.
In the west, the altitude can vary from the mountain peaks to river valleys as much as .
Yunnan is rich in natural resources and has the largest diversity of plant life in China.
Of the approximately 30,000 species of higher plants in China, Yunnan has perhaps 17,000 or more.
Yunnan's reserves of aluminium, lead, zinc and tin are the largest in China, and there are also major reserves of copper and nickel.
The Han Empire first recorded diplomatic relations with the province at the end of the 2nd century BC.
It became the seat of a Sino-Tibetan-speaking kingdom of Nanzhao in the 8th century AD.
Nanzhao was multi-ethnic, but the elite most-likely spoke a northern dialect of Yi.
The Mongols conquered the region in the 13th century, with local control exercised by warlords until the 1930s.
From the Yuan dynasty onward, the area was part of a central-government sponsored population movement towards the Southwestern frontier, with 2 major waves of migrants arriving from Han-majority areas in northern and southeast China.
As with other parts of China's southwest, Japanese occupation in the north during World War II forced another migration of majority Han people into the region.
These two waves of migration contributed to Yunnan being one of the most ethnically diverse provinces of China, with ethnic minorities accounting for about 34 percent of its total population.
Major ethnic groups include Yi, Bai, Hani, Zhuang, Dai and Miao.
========,2,History.
========,3,Prehistory period.
The Yuanmou Man, a "Homo erectus" fossil unearthed by railway engineers in the 1960s, has been determined to be the oldest-known hominid fossil in China.
By the Neolithic period, there were human settlements in the area of Lake Dian.
These people used stone tools and constructed simple wooden structures.
========,3,Pre-Nanzhao period.
Around the 3rd century BC, the central area of Yunnan around present day Kunming was known as Dian.
The Chu general Zhuang Qiao (庄跤) entered the region from the upper Yangtze River and set himself up as "King of Dian".
He and his followers brought into Yunnan an influx of Chinese influence, the start of a long history of migration and cultural expansion.
In 221 BC, Qin Shi Huang unified China and extended his authority south.
Commanderies and counties were established in Yunnan.
An existing road in Sichuan – the "Five Foot Way" – was extended south to around present day Qujing, in eastern Yunnan.
The Han–Dian wars began under Emperor Wu.
He dispatched a series of military campaigns against the Dian during the southward expansion of the Han Dynasty.
In 109 BC, Emperor Wu sent General Guo Chang (郭昌) south to Yunnan, establishing Yizhou commandery and 24 subordinate counties.
The commandery seat was at Dianchi county in present-day Jinning.
Another county was called "Yunnan", probably the first use of the name.
To expand the burgeoning trade with Burma and India, Emperor Wu also sent to maintain and expand the Five Foot Way, renaming it "Southwest Barbarian Way" ().
By this time, agricultural technology in Yunnan had improved markedly.
The local people used bronze tools, plows and kept a variety of livestock, including cattle, horses, sheep, goats, pigs and dogs.
Anthropologists have determined that these people were related to the people now known as the Tai.
They lived in tribal congregations, sometimes led by exiled Chinese.
During the Three Kingdoms, the territory of present-day Yunnan, western Guizhou and southern Sichuan was collectively called Nanzhong.
The dissolution of Chinese central authority led to increased autonomy for Yunnan and more power for the local tribal structures.
In AD 225, the famed statesman Zhuge Liang led three columns into Yunnan to pacify the tribes.
His seven captures of Meng Huo, a local magnate, is much celebrated in Chinese folklore.
International trade flowed by din of Yunnan.
In the 4th century, northern China was largely overrun by nomadic tribes from the north.
In the 320s, the Cuan () clan migrated into Yunnan.
Cuan Chen () named himself king and held authority from Lake Dian, then known as Kunchuan.
Henceforth the Cuan clan ruled eastern Yunnan for over four hundred years.
========,3,Nanzhao period.
Before the rise and dominance of the Nanzhao Kingdom around Yunnan in the eighth century, many local tribes, clans, and other groups sprang up.
Around Lake Erhai, namely, the Dali area, there emerged six zhao: Mengxi(), Yuexi(), Langqiong(), Dengdan(), Shilang(), and Mengshe().
Zhao() was an indigenous non-Chinese language term meaning "king" or "kingdom."
Among the six regimes Mengshe was located south of the other five; therefore given the new, larger context, it was called Nanzhao (Southern Kingdom).
By the 730s Nanzhao had succeeded in bringing the Erhai Lake–area under its authority.
In 738, the western Yunnan was united by Piluoge, the fourth king of Nanzhao, who was confirmed by the imperial court of the Tang Dynasty as king of Yunnan.
Ruling from Dali, the thirteen kings of Nanzhao ruled over more than two centuries and played a part in the dynamic relationship between China and Tibet.
By the 750s, Nanzhao had taken eastern Yunnan into its empire and had become a potential rival to Tang China.
The following period inevitably saw conflicts between Tang China and Nanzhao.
In 750, Nanzhao attacked and captured Yaozhou, the largest Tang settlement in Yunnan.In 751, Xianyu Zhongtong (), the regional commander of Jiannan (Sichuan), led a Tang campaign against Nanzhao.
Geluofeng regarded the previous incident as personal and wrote to Xianyu to seek peace.
Howerver, Xianyu Zhongtong detained the Nanzhao envoys and turned down the appeal.
Confronted with Tang armies, Nanzhao immediately turned its allegiance to Tubo.
The Tubo and Nanzhao agreed to be "fraternal states"; Geluofeng was given the titles zanpuzhong ("younger brother").The Nanzhao-Tubo alliance finally made Xianyu's expedition became a disaster.
Tang China did not give up after one failure.
In 753, another expedition was prepared, but thiswas also defeated by Nanzhao.
In 754, the Tang organized an army of more than 100,000 troops that advanced to the Dali plain, resulting in only another slaughter.
By the end of the eighth century, Tang was no longer a major threat to Nanzhao.
Nanzhao's expansion lasted for several decades.
In 829, Nanzhao suddenly plundered Sichuan and entered Chengdu.
When it retreated, hundreds of Sichuan people, including skilled artisans, were taken to Yunnan.
In 832, the Nanzhao army captured the capital of the Pyu kingdom in modern upper Burma.
Nanzhao also attacked the Khmer peoples of Zhenla.
Generally speaking, Nanzhao was then the most powerful kingdom in mainland Southeast Asia, and played an extremely active role in multistate interactions.
In 859, Nanzhao captured Bozhou, and this event exacerbated the Nanzhao-Tang clashes.
When the Tang governor of Annam took Bozhou back in the following year, Nanzhao, with the help of native peoples, occupied Hanoi as the Tang army moved to Bozhou.
When the Tang forces returned, Nanzhao troops retreated from Hanoi but attacked and plundered Yongzhou.
In the winter of 862, Nanzhao, allying with local groups, led an army of over 50,000 men to invade Annam again.
It is reported that the Tang forces lost over 150,000 soldiers (either killed or captured by Nanzhao) in the two Annam battles.The autumn of 866 saw Tang victory in Hanoi and soon all of the Nanzhao forces were driven away.
But Tang China had lost its ability to attack Nanzhao.
While Nanzhao was being defeated in Annam, it still occasionally attacked Sichuan.
In 869, Shilong (), the eighth king and the first empire of Nanzhao, invaded Sichuan.
In 874, Nanzhao attacked Sichuan again.
In 902, Zheng Maisi, the qingpingguan (,"Primier Minister") of Nanzhao, murdered the infant king of Nanzhao, and established a short-lived regime, namely, Da Chang He.
Nanzhao, a once-powerful empire, disappeared.
========,3,Post-Nanzhao period.
In 937, Duan Siping overthrew the Nanzhao and established the Kingdom of Dali.
The kingdom was conquered by the Mongol Empire in 1253 after Dali King Duan Xingzhi defected to the Mongols.
The Duans incorporated into the Mongol dominion as Maharajahs of the new province.
The Mongolian prince sent to administer the region with them was killed.
In 1273, Kublai Khan reformed the province and appointed the Semuren Sayid Ajall as its governor.
The Yunnan Province during the Yuan Dynasty included significant portions of Upper Burma after the Burmese campaigns in the 1270s and 1280s.
But with the fall of the Yuan Dynasty in 1368, the Ming Dynasty destroyed the Yuan loyalists led by Basalawarmi in the Ming conquest of Yunnan by the early 1380s.
The Ming installed Mu Ying and his family as hereditary aristocrats in Yunnan.
During the Ming and Qing dynasties, large areas of Yunnan were administered under the native chieftain system.
Under the Qing dynasty a war with Burma also occurred in the 1760s due to the attempted consolidation of borderlands under local chiefs by both China and Burma.
Yunnan was a destination for Han Chinese during Yuan rule.
Colonizers moved into the area during Ming and Qing rule.
During the Ming Dynasty, 3 million Han Chinese mostly from Nanjing (before the original Nanjing population was largely replaced by Wu speakers) and some from Shanxi and Hebei settled in Yunnan.
Although largely forgotten, the bloody Panthay Rebellion of the Muslim Hui people and other local minorities against the Manchu rulers of the Qing Dynasty caused the deaths of up to a million people in Yunnan.
A British officer testified that the Muslims did not rebel for religious reasons and that the Chinese were tolerant of different religions and were unlikely to have caused the revolt by interfering with the practising of Islam.
Loyalist Muslim forces helped Qing crush the rebel Muslims.
The Qing armies only massacred Muslims who had rebelled or supported the rebels and spared Muslims who took no part in the uprising.
In 1894, George Ernest Morrison, an Australian correspondent for "The Times", traveled from Beijing to British-occupied Burma via Yunnan.
His book, "An Australian in China", details his experiences.
The 1905 Tibetan Rebellion in which Tibetan Buddhist Lamas attacked and killed French Catholic missionaries spread to Yunnan.
Yunnan was transformed by the events of the war against Japan, which caused many east coast refugees and industrial establishments to relocate to the province.
It assumed strategic significance, particularly as the Burma Road from Lashio, in Burma to Kunming was a fought over supply line of vital importance to China's war effort.
University faculty and students in the east had originally decamped to Changsha, capital of Hunan.
But as the Japanese forces were gaining more territory they eventually bombed Changsha in February 1938.
The 800 faculty and students who were left had to flee and made the 1,000 mile journey to Kunming, capital of Yunnan in China's mountainous southwest.
It was here that the National Southwest Associated University (commonly known as 'Lianda University') was established.
In these extraordinary wartime circumstances for eight years, staff, professors and students had to survive and operate in makeshift quarters that were subject to sporadic bombing campaigns by the Japanese.
There were dire shortages of food, equipment, books, clothing and other essential needs, but they managed to conduct the running of a modern university.
Over those eight years of war (1937-1945), Lianda became famous nationwide for having and producing many, if not most, of China's most prominent academics, scholars, scientists and intellectuals.
Both of China's only Nobel laureates in physics studied at Lianda in Kunming.
========,3,Naturalists.
Thousands of plant, insect and mammal species were described in the XIXth century by scientists of the French National Museum of Natural History, Paris, in connection with permanent settlements of missionaries of the "Missions étrangères de Paris" in north-west Yunnan, among them noticeably Jean-André Soulié and Felix Biet.
From 1916 to 1917, Roy Chapman Andrews and Yvette Borup Andrews led the Asiatic Zoological Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History through much of western and southern Yunnan, as well as other provinces of China.
The book, "Camps and Trails in China", records their experiences.
Other notable explorers include Heinrich Handel-Mazzetti; George Forrest; Joseph Francis Charles Rock, who from 1922–1949 spent most of his time studying the flora, peoples and languages of southwest China, mainly in Yunnan; and Peter Goullart, a White Russian who studied Naxi culture and lived in Lijiang from 1940 to 1949.
========,2,Geography.
Yunnan is the most southwestern province in China, with the Tropic of Cancer running through its southern part.
The province has an area of , 4.1% of the nation's total.
The northern part of the province forms part of the Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau.
The province borders Guangxi and Guizhou in the east, Sichuan in the north, and the Tibet Autonomous Region in the northwest.
It shares a border of with Burma in the west, Laos in the south and Vietnam in the southeast.
For practical purposes, all of Yunnan province falls within the Zomia (region) of Asia.
========,3,Geology.
Yunnan is at the far eastern edge of the Himalayan uplift, and was pushed up in the Pleistocene, primarily in the Middle Pleistocene, although the uplift continues into the present.
The eastern part of the province is a limestone plateau with karst topography and unnavigable rivers flowing through deep mountain gorges.
The main surface formations of the plateau are the Lower Permian Maokou Formation, characterized by thick limestone deposits, the Lower Permian Qixia Formation, characterised by dolomitic limestones and dolostones, the Upper Permian basalts of the Ermeishan Formation (formerly Omeishan plateau basalts), and the red sandstones, mudstones, siltstones, and conglomerates of the Mesozoic–Paleogene, including the Lufeng Formation and the Lunan Group (Lumeiyi, Xiaotun, and Caijiacong formations).
In this area is the noted Stone Forest or Shilin, eroded vertical pinnacles of limestone (Maokou Formation).
In the eastern part the rivers generally run eastwards.
The western half is characterized by mountain ranges and rivers running north and south.
========,3,Climate.
Yunnan has a generally mild climate with pleasant and fair weather because of the province's location on south-facing mountain slopes, receiving the influence of both the Pacific and Indian oceans, and although the growing period is long, the rugged terrain provides little arable land.
See "Agriculture in Yunnan".
Under the Köppen climate classification, much of the province lies within the subtropical highland (Köppen "Cwb") or humid subtropical zone ("Cwa"), with mild to warm winters, and tempered summers, except in the almost tropical south, where temperatures regularly exceed in the warmer half of the year.
"In general", January average temperatures range from ; July averages vary from .
Average annual rainfall ranges from , with over half the rain occurring between June and August.
The plateau region has moderate temperatures.
The western canyon region is hot and humid at the valley bottoms, but there are freezing winds at the mountaintops.
========,3,Topography.
The terrain is largely mountainous, especially in the north and west.
A series of high mountain chains spreads across the province.
There is a distinct canyon region to the west and a plateau region to the east.
Yunnan's major rivers flow through the deep valleys between the mountains.
The average elevation is .
The mountains are highest in the north where they reach more than ; in the south they rise no higher than .
The highest point in the north is the Kawagebo Peak in Deqin County on the Diqing Plateau, which is about ; and the lowest is in the Red River Valley in Hekou County, near the Vietnamese border, with an elevation of .
The eastern half of the province is a limestone plateau with karst scenery and unnavigable rivers flowing through deep mountain gorges; the western half is characterised by mountain ranges and rivers running north and south.
These include the Nujiang () and the Lancangjiang ().
The rugged, vertical terrain produces a wide range of flora and fauna, and the province has been called a natural zoological and botanical garden.
========,3,Borders.
Bordering Chinese provincial-level divisions are Tibet, Sichuan, Guizhou and Guangxi.
Starting from the east and working clockwise, bordering countries are Vietnam (Hà Giang, Lào Cai, Lai Châu and Điện Biên provinces), Laos (Phongsaly, Oudomxay and Luang Namtha provinces), Myanmar (states of Shan and Kachin).
The main border crossings are:
***LIST***.
========,3,Lakes.
There are several major lakes in Yunnan.
The province has nine lakes with areas of over .
They include:
***LIST***.
========,3,Rivers.
Yunnan is the source of two rivers, the Xi River (there known as the Nanpan and Hongshui) and the Yuan River.
The Hongshui is a principal source stream of the Xi River.
Rising as the Nanpan in eastern Yunnan province, it flows south and east to form part of the boundary between Guizhou province and Guangxi autonomous region.
Flowing for , it unites with the Yu River at Guiping to form what eventually becomes the Xi River.
The province is drained by six major river systems:
***LIST***.
========,3,Biodiversity.
Yunnan is China's most diverse province, biologically as well as culturally.
The province contains snow-capped mountains and true tropical environments, thus supporting an unusually full spectrum of species and vegetation types.
The Yunnan camellia ("Camellia reticulata") is the provincial emblem.
During summer, the Great Plateau of Tibet acts as a barrier to monsoon winds, trapping moisture in the province.
This gives the alpine flora in particular what one source has called a "lushness found nowhere else".
This topographic range combined with a tropical moisture sustains extremely high biodiversity and high degrees of endemism, probably the richest botanically in the world's temperate regions.
Perhaps 17,000 species of higher plants, of which an estimated 2,500 are endemic, can be found in the province.
The province is said to have "as much flowering plant diversity as the rest of the Northern Hemisphere put together".
Yunnan Province has less than 4% of the land of China, yet contains about half of China's birds and mammals.
Yunnan is home to, most notably, the southeast Asian gaur, a giant forest-dwelling bovine, the Indochinese tiger and the Asian elephant.
Other extremely rare species are the Yunnan box turtle and the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey, and it is feared that the Yunnan lar gibbon already is extinct.
The freshwater fish fauna is highly diverse with about 620 species, including more than 580 natives (the remaining are introduced).
This equals almost 40% of the freshwater fish species in China.
Of the Yunnan natives, more than 250 are endemic to the province and many of these are threatened.
Several species that are restricted to single lakes (notably Dian, Erhai, Fuxian and Yilong) are likely already are extinct.
By far the most diverse order in Yunnan is Cypriniformes; both in total species number and number of endemics.
========,3,Natural resources.
A main source of wealth lies in its vast mineral resources; indeed, mining is the leading industry in Yunnan.
Yunnan has proven deposits of 86 kinds of minerals in 2,700 places.
Some 13% of the proved deposits of minerals are the largest of their kind in China, and two-thirds of the deposits are among the largest of their kind in the Yangtze River valley and in south China.
Yunnan ranks first in the country in deposits of zinc, lead, tin, cadmium, indium, thallium and crocidolite.
Other deposits include iron, coal, copper, gold, mercury, silver, antimony and sulfur.
More than 150 kinds of minerals have been discovered in the province.
The potential value of the proven deposits in Yunnan is 3 trillion yuan, 40% of which come from fuel minerals, 7.3% from metallic minerals and 52.7% from nonmetallic minerals.
Yunnan has sufficient rainfall and many rivers and lakes.
The annual water flow originating in the province is 200 cubic kilometres, three times that of the Yellow River.
The rivers flowing into the province from outside add 160 cubic kilometres, which means there are more than ten thousand cubic metres of water for each person in the province.
This is four times the average in the country.
The rich water resources offer abundant hydro-energy.
China is constructing a series of dams on the Mekong to develop it as a waterway and source of power; the first was completed at Manwan in 1993.
========,4,Drought.
After four years of drought, in the fall of 2012, winter of 2012-13, and spring of 2013 severe drought was reported which affected flow of springs and the level of spring-fed lakes; agriculture and urban water supplies were also affected.
Water levels in Yilong Lake dropped and grass was reported growing in the middle of the lake bed.
========,2,Governance.
========,3,Administrative divisions.
Yunnan consists of sixteen prefecture-level divisions: eight prefecture-level cities and eight autonomous prefectures:
The sixteen prefecture-level divisions of Yunnan are subdivided into 129 county-level divisions (13 districts, 14 county-level cities, 73 counties, and 29 autonomous counties).
========,3,Politics.
Secretaries of the CPC Yunnan Committee: The Secretary of the CPC is the highest ranking and most important position in Yunnan.
***LIST***.
Governors of Yunnan: The Governor is the second highest office in Yunnan, after the Secretary of the CPC Yunnan Committee.
The Governor, who is elected by the Yunnan Provincial People's Congress, is responsible for all economic, environmental, political, personnel and foreign affairs issues concerning Yunnan.
***LIST***.
========,2,Demographics.
========,3,Ethnicity.
Yunnan is noted for a very high level of ethnic diversity.
It has the highest number of ethnic groups among the provinces and autonomous regions in China.
Among the country's 56 recognised ethnic groups, twenty-five are found in Yunnan.
Some 38% of the province's population are members of minorities, including the Yi, Bai, Hani, Tai, Dai, Miao, Lisu, Hui, Lahu, Va, Nakhi, Yao, Tibetan, Jingpo, Blang, Pumi, Nu, Achang, Jinuo, Mongolian, Derung, Manchu, Sui, and Buyei.
Several other groups are represented, but they live neither in compact settlements nor do they reach the required threshold of five thousand to be awarded the official status of being present in the province.
Some groups, such as the Mosuo, who are officially recognised as part of the Naxi, have in the past claimed official status as a national minority, and are now recognised with the status of Mosuo people.
Ethnic groups are widely distributed in the province.
Some twenty-five minorities live in compact communities, each of which has a population of more than five thousand.
Ten ethnic minorities living in border areas and river valleys include the Hui, Manchu, Bai, Naxi, Mongolian, Zhuang, Dai, Achang, Buyei and Shui, with a combined population of 4.5 million; those in low mountainous areas are the Hani, Yao, Lahu, Va, Jingpo, Blang and Jino, with a combined population of 5 million; and those in high mountainous areas are Miao, Lisu, Tibetan, Pumi and Drung, with a total population of four million.
========,3,Languages.
Most dialects of the Chinese language spoken in Yunnan belong to the southwestern subdivision of the Mandarin group, and are therefore very similar to the dialects of neighbouring Sichuan and Guizhou provinces.
Notable features found in many Yunnan dialects include the partial or complete loss of distinction between finals and , as well as the lack of .
In addition to the local dialects, most people also speak Standard Chinese ("Putonghua", commonly called "Mandarin"), which is used in the media, by the government, and as the language of instruction in education.
Yunnan's ethnic diversity is reflected in its linguistic diversity.
Languages spoken in Yunnan include Tibeto-Burman languages such as Bai, Yi, Tibetan, Hani, Jingpo, Lisu, Lahu, Naxi; Tai languages like Zhuang, Bouyei, Dong, Shui, Tai Lü and Tai Nüa; as well as Hmong–Mien languages.
The Naxi, in particular, use the Dongba script, which is the only pictographic writing system in use in the world today.
The Dongba script was mainly used to provide the Dongba priests with instructions on how to carry out their rituals: today the Dongba script features more as a tourist attraction.
Perhaps the best known Western Dongba scholar was Joseph Rock.
========,3,Religion.
According to a demographic analysis of religions in Yunnan, as of 2005 the province has around 4 million believers of the five government-sanctioned organised religious doctrines of China, almost 90% of them belonging to the ethnic minorities.
Of these:
***LIST***.
According to surveys conducted in 2004 and 2007, in those years approximately 32.22% of the province's population was involved in worship of ancestors and 2.75% declared a Christian identity.
Most of the population of the province practices traditional indigenous religions including the Chinese folk religion among the Han Chinese, Bimoism among the Yi peoples and Benzhuism among the Bai people.
The Dai people are one of the few ethnic minorities of China that traditionally follow the Theravada branch of Buddhism.
Most of the Hui people of the region are Muslims.
Christianity is dominant among the Lisu, the Jingpo and the Derung ethnic groups.
========,2,Agriculture.
The region maintains a strong agricultural focus.
Agriculture is restricted to the few upland plains, open valleys, and terraced hillsides.
Level land for agriculture is extremely scarce and only about 5 percent of the province is under cultivation.
Rice is the main crop; corn, barley, wheat, rapeseed, sweet potatoes, soybeans (as a food crop), tea, sugarcane, tobacco, and cotton are also grown.
On the steep slopes in the west livestock is raised and timber, a valuable resource, is cut (teak in the southwest).
Tobacco is the main (export) product and makes up a big part of the provincial GDP.
Furthermore, Yunnan has a strong competitive potential in the fruit and vegetable industries, especially in low value-added commodities such as fresh and dried vegetables and fresh apples.
Yunnan is one of the regions in the world with the most abundant resources of wild edible mushrooms.
In China, there are 938 kinds of edible mushrooms, and over 800 varieties can be found in Yunnan.
In 2004, around 7,744 tons of wild edible mushrooms were exported, making up for 70% of the total export of this product in China.
The so-called 'pine mushroom' is the main product in Yunnan and is exported to Japan in large quantities.
Due to China's growing consumption of dairy products, Yunnan's dairy industry is also developing very rapidly and is also aiming to export to its ASEAN neighbors.
The flower industry in Yunnan province started to develop towards the end of the 1980s.
Yunnan province accounts for 50% of China's total cut flower production.
The size of the planting area for cut flowers in Yunnan province amounts to 4000 hectares.
In 2003, the output totaled 2.3 billion stems.
In 2002 the flower industry in Yunnan had a total output of RMB 3.4 billion.
Export amounted to US$18 million.
Apart from sales on the domestic market, Yunnan also exports to a number of foreign countries and regions such as Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Thailand and Singapore.
========,2,Economy.
As of the mid-19th century, Yunnan exported birds, brass, tin, gemstones, musk, nuts, and peacock feathers mainly to stores in Guangzhou.
They imported silk, wool, and cotton cloth, tobacco and books.
Yunnan is one of China's relatively undeveloped provinces with more poverty-stricken counties than the other provinces.
In 1994, about 7 million people lived below the poverty line of less than an annual average income of 300 yuan per capita.
They were distributed in the province's 73 counties mainly and financially supported by the central government.
With an input of 3.15 billion yuan in 2002, the absolutely poor rural population in the province has been reduced from 4.05 million in 2000 to 2.86 million.
The poverty alleviation plan includes five large projects aimed at improving infrastructure facilities.
They involve planned attempts at soil improvement, water conservation, electric power, roads, and "green belt" building.
Upon the completion of the projects, the province hopes this will alleviate the shortages of grain, water, electric power and roads.
Yunnan lags behind the east coast of China in relation to socio-economic development.
However, because of its geographic location the province has comparative advantages in regional and border trade with countries in southeast Asia.
The Lancang River (upper reaches of Mekong River) is the waterway to southeast Asia.
In recent years land transportation has been improved to strengthen economic and trade co-operation among countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion.
Yunnan's abundance in resources determines that the province's pillar industries are: agriculture, tobacco, mining, hydro-electric power, and tourism.
In general, the province still depends on the natural resources.
Secondary industry is currently the largest industrial tier in Yunnan, contributing more than 45 percent of GDP.
Tertiary industry contributes 40 percent and agriculture 15 percent.
Investment is the key driver of Yunnan's economic growth, especially in construction.
The main challenge that Yunnan faces is its lack of major development.
Its low productivity and competitiveness restrict the rapid development of the province.
The province also faces great challenges in social issues such as environmental protection, poverty elimination, illegal migration, drug trafficking and HIV/AIDS.
Yunnan's four pillar industries include tobacco, agriculture/biology, mining, and tourism.
The main manufacturing industries are iron and steel production and copper-smelting, commercial vehicles, chemicals, fertilizers, textiles, and optical instruments.
Yunnan has trade contacts with more than seventy countries and regions in the world.
Yunnan established the Muse border trade zone (located in Ruili) along its border with Burma.
Yunnan mainly exports tobacco, machinery and electrical equipment, chemical and agricultural products, and non-ferrous metals.
In 2008, its total two-way trade (imports and exports) reached US$9.6 billion.
The province signed foreign direct investment contracts involving US$1.69 billion, of which US$777 million were actually utilized during the year.
Yunnan's unemployment rate at the end of 2008 was 4.21%.
Yunnan's nominal GDP in 2011 was 875.1 billion yuan (US$138.92 billion), an annual growth rate of 13.7%.
Its per capita GDP was 13,494 yuan (US$1,975).
The share of GDP of Yunnan's primary, secondary, and tertiary industries were 17.9%, 43%, and 39.1% respectively.
Yunnan is one of the major production bases of copper, lead, zinc, tin and aluminum in China.
Gejiu is well known as "the Kingdom of Zinc" with the reserves ranked first in the country.
The Yunxi brand refined tin is one of the main products in Gejiu, which is registered on the London Metal Exchange (LME).
Besides, reserves of germanium, indium, zirconium, platinum, rock salt, sylvite, nickel, phosphate, mirabilite, arsenic and blue asbestos are also high.
Significant copper deposits are found at Dongchuan, iron ore at Wuding, and coal at Xuanwei and Kaiyuan.
Economic policy to locate new industry in interior areas with substantial mineral wealth, led to major industrial development in Yunnan, especially in the Kunming area.
The electricity industry is another important economic pillar of Yunnan, which plays a key role in the "West-East Electricity Transmission Project".
The electricity produced in Yunnan is mainly transported to Guangdong.
========,3,Economic and Technological Development Zones.

========,2,Education.
Since the 1960s, improvements have been achieved in the overall educational level, which can be seen in the increase in average years of regular education received.
The development of part-time schools have brought adult, distance and continuing education to farms, factories, offices, and other places.
Evening, time off work / study leave classes allow people to receive education without leaving their jobs.
Policies to upgrade adult education have begun to complement the campaign against illiteracy.
A basic Chinese vocabulary in simplified strokes is taught to millions of illiterate people in short, intensive courses.
Despite progress made, Yunnan's illiteracy rate remains one of the highest in China mainly due to insufficient education among minority peoples.
In higher education, Yunnan has one "National Key University"—Yunnan University in Kunming.
There is also a growing number of technical schools, among which the most prominent are the Yunnan Normal University, the Southwest Forestry University, Yunnan Agricultural University, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming Medical University, Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Kunming University of Science and Technology.
Other notable establishments of learning are the , the Yunnan Astronomical Observatory, and the Yunnan Provincial Library.
As of 2000, there were 24 institutions of higher learning in Yunnan, with an enrollment of over 90,400 students and a faculty of 9,237; 2,562 secondary schools with an enrollment of more than 2,137,400 students and 120,461 teachers; and 22,151 primary schools with an enrollment of 4,720,600 pupils and a faculty of 210,507.
The gross enrollment rate of school-age children was 99.02%.

========,2,Health.
Yunnan Province is responsible for about 50% of officially reported malaria cases in China.
It is presently considered to be the main source of plague in China.
========,2,Transport.
========,3,Railways.
The first railway in Yunnan was the narrow gauge Yunnan–Vietnam Railway built by France from 1904 to 1910 to connect Kunming with Vietnam, then a French colony.
In Yunnan, the Chinese section of this railway is known as the Yunnan-Hekou Railway and the line gave Yunnan access to the seaport at Haiphong.
During the Second World War, Britain and the United States began building a railway from Yunnan to Burma but abandoned the effort due to Japanese advance.
Due in part to difficult terrain both locally and in surrounding provinces and the shortage of capital for rail construction, Yunnan remained outside of China's domestic rail network until 1966 when the Guiyang–Kunming Railway was completed.
The line would not enter into operation until 1970, the same year that the Chengdu-Kunming was completed.
The Nanning–Kunming Railway to Guangxi was completed in 1997, followed by the Neijiang–Kunming Railway in 2001.
The Panxi Railway, originally built in 1975 to draw coal from neighboring Guizhou, was electrified in 2001 and adds to eastern Yunnan's outbound rail transport capacity.
Within the province, the Kunming–Yuxi, opened in 1993, and the Guangtong–Dali, opened in 1998, expanded the rail network to southern and western Yunnan, respectively.
The Dali–Lijiang Railway, opened in 2010, brought rail service to northwestern Yunnan.
That line is planned to be extended further north to Xamgyi'nyilha County.
The province is extending the railway network to neighboring countries in Southeast Asia.
From Yuxi, the Yuxi–Mengzi Railway, built from 2005 to 2013, and the Mengzi–Hekou Railway, under construction since 2008, will form a standard gauge railway connection with Vietnam.
The Dali–Ruili Railway, under construction since May 2011, will bring rail service to the border with Myanmar.
Also under planning is a rail line from Yuxi to Mohan, in Xishuangbana Prefecture, on the border with Laos.
This line could be extended further south to Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore.
========,3,Burma Road.
The Burma Road was a highway extending about through mountainous terrain from Lashio, northeast Burma northeastward to Kunming, China.
Undertaken by the Chinese after the start of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937 and completed in 1938, it was a vital transportation route for wartime supplies to the Chinese government from Rangoon and shipped by railroad to Lashio from 1938 to 1946.
An extension runs east through China from Kunming, then north to Chongqing.
This traffic increased in importance to China after the Japanese took effective control of the Chinese coast and of Indochina.
It was seized by the Japanese in 1942 and reopened when it was connected to the Stilwell Road from India.
The Ledo Road (later called the Stilwell Road) from Ledo, India, into Burma was begun in December 1942.
In 1944 the Ledo Road reached Myitkyina and was joined to the Burma Road.
Both roads have lost their former importance and are in a state of disrepair.
The Burma Road's importance diminished after World War II, but it has remained a link in a 3,400-km road system from Yangon, Burma, to Chongqing.
========,3,Highways.
Road construction in Yunnan continues unabated: over the last years the province has added more new roads than any other province.
Today expressways link Kunming through Dali to Baoshan, Kunming to Mojiang (on the way to Jinghong), Kunming to Qujing, Kunming to Shilin (Stone Forest).
The official plan is to connect all major towns and neighbouring capitals with expressways by 2010, and to complete a high-speed road network by 2020.
All county towns are now accessible by paved, all-weather roads from Kunming, all townships have a road connection (the last to be connected was Yangla, in the far north, but Dulongjiang remains cut off for about six months every year), and about half of all villages have road access.
Second-level national highways stretch , third-level highways, and fourth-level highways, .
The province has formed a network of communication lines radiating from Kunming to Sichuan and Guizhou provinces and Guangxi and Tibet autonomous regions, and further on to Burma, Laos, Vietnam and Thailand.
National highways running through Yunnan province are:

========,4,Expressways.
After the opening of the Suolongsi to Pingyuanjie expressway, Luofu expressway, the first between Yunnan and Guangxi Province, opened on October 2007.
It has made material and passenger transportation between the two provinces much more convenient.
Moreover, Luofu Expressway has also become the main road from Yunnan to Guangxi and the coastal ports.
Luofu Expressway begins from the crossroads of Luo Village between Yunnan and Guangxi Provinces and ends at Funing County of Wenshan State.
The total length of the expressway is 79.3 kilometers which has shortened the commute between Yunnan and Guangxi from the previous 3 and half hours to just 50 minutes.
Expressways running through Yunnan province are:

========,3,Waterways.
Generally, rivers are obstacles to transport in Yunnan.
Only very small parts of Yunnan's river systems are navigable.
However, China is constructing a series of dams on the Mekong to develop it as a waterway and source of power; the first was completed at Manwan in 1993.
In 1995, the province put an investment of 171 million yuan to add another of navigation lines.
It built two wharfs with an annual handling capacity of 300,000 to 400,000 tons each and four wharfs with an annual handling capacity of 100,000 tons each.
The annual volume of goods transported was two million tons and that of passengers transported, two million.
========,3,Airports.
The province has twenty domestic air routes from Kunming to Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Haikou, Chongqing, Shenyang, Harbin, Wuhan, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Hangzhou, Xiamen, Nanning, Shenzhen, Guiyang, Changsha, Guilin, Lhasa and Hong Kong; ten provincial air routes from Kunming to Jinghong, Mangshi, Lincang, Tengchong, Lijiang, Dali, Xamgyi'nyilha, Zhaotong, Baoshan and Simao; and ten international air routes from Kunming to Bangkok, Kolkata, Chiang Mai, Yangon, Singapore, Seoul, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Kuala Lumpur and Vientiane.
Replacing Kunming Wujiaba International Airport is Kunming Changshui International Airport, which opened June 28, 2012.
========,3,Bridges.
Bridge-building in Yunnan date back at least 1,300 years when the Tibetan Empire built an iron chain bridge over the Yangtze to the neighboring Nanzhao Kingdom at what is today Weixi Lisu Autonomous County during the Tang Dynasty.
Iron chain bridges are still found across high river valleys of Yunnan.
The Jinlong Bridge on the Jinsha River in Lijiang remains the oldest bridge over the Yangtze.
With the expansion of the highway and railway network in Yunnan, numerous large-scale bridges have been built across the region's myriad of rivers, including the Yangtze which has dozens of crossings in Yunnan.
========,2,Culture.
Yunnan's cultural life is one of remarkable diversity.
Archaeological findings have unearthed sacred burial structures holding elegant bronzes in Jinning, south of Kunming.
In Zhaotong in northeastern Yunnan, there has been discovered, frescos of the Jin Dynasty (265–420).
Many Chinese cultural relics have been discovered in later periods.
The lineage of tribal way of life of the indigenous peoples persisted uninfluenced by modernity until the mid-20th century.
Tribal traditions, such as Yi slaveholding and Wa headhunting, have since been abolished.
After the Cultural Revolution (1966–76), when many minority culture and religious practices were suppressed, Yunnan has come to celebrate its cultural diversity and subsequently many local customs and festivals have flourished.
========,3,Tea.
Yunnan has several different tea growing regions.
One of Yunnan's best known products is Pu-erh tea (or Puer), named after the old tea trading town of Pu-erh (Puer).
The province is also known for its Yunnan Gold and other Dianhong teas, developed in the 20th century.
========,3,Tourism.
Yunnan Province, due to its beautiful landscapes, mild climate and cultural diversity, is one of China's major tourist destinations.
Most visitors are Chinese tourists, although trips to Yunnan are organized by an increasing number of foreign travel agencies as well.
Mainland tourists travel by the masses; 2.75 million Chinese visited Yunnan last October during National Holiday.
Also a different trend is slowly developing; small scale and environmentally friendly ecotourism.
At the moment projects in this field are often being set up with help of NGO's.
In 2004, tourism revenues amounted to 37 billion RMB, and thus accounting for 12, 6% of the provincial GDP.
Another fact indicating the importance of tourism in Yunnan Province is capital Kunming hosting the China International Travel Mart every two years.
This tourism trade fair is the largest of its kind in Asia and serves as an important platform for professionals in the sector.
More than 80 countries and regions were present during the 2005 edition.
Tourism is expected to grow further.
In 2010, the province welcomed over 2.3 million overseas tourists and the Yunnan Provincial Tourism Bureau aims to draw 4.3 million overseas arrivals under the 12th Five-Year Tourism Development Plan.
Kunming city is expected to add 11 new mid- to high-end hotels with an inventory of under 4,000 rooms between 2012 and 2016.
The Nature Conservancy and the Chinese government came together to form a partnership and explore the possibility of bringing adventure tourism onto the rivers of Southwest China.
A two-month white-water expedition explored from the Mekong River's Moon Gorge to Yangze River's Great Bend.
The expedition provided valuable information to the partnership, encouraging them to take into account the safety, culture, economics, and conservation of the Yunnan Province.
Creating an adventure tourism sector would bring valuable economic resources to the economically struggling population, who had once relied on logging as income prior to it being banned due to deforestation.
Tourist centres in Yunnan include:
