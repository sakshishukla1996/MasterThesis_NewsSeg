The Peter Gray family and the Conrad Hartsock family were the earliest settlers to the area.
They came to the Half Moon Valley in 1788, from Frederick County, Maryland, and settled in what is now Patton Township.
The early days were strongly influenced by Methodism.
As soon as Peter Gray had a roof on his log cabin, he began Sunday School classes, and founded what is today Grays United Methodist Church.
These settlers also made pilgrimages to church at Warriors Mark, a 12-mile distance, because that was the nearest regular preaching point in the valley.
