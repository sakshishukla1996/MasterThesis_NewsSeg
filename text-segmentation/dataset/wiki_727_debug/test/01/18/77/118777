========,2,History.
This area was designated as within Royal Oak Township; it was first settled by European Americans in 1840, but remained sparsely populated for many decades following.
The first major housing development was constructed in 1914 at the time of World War I, when the township sold land to the Majestic Land Company to be developed as the Oak Park subdivision.
The subdivision was incorporated as a village on May 3, 1927.
Two petition drives during the Great Depression to dissolve the village government and return it to the township, citing "excessively high cost of village government," failed in 1931 and 1933, respectively.
The village incorporated as city on October 29, 1945 following the end of World War II.
Stimulated by the GI Bill which aided veterans in buying new housing, highways to improve commuting, and planned developments in the late 1950s, Oak Park from 1950 to 1960 was named as "America's Fastest Growing City".
Its population increased sevenfold, from 5,000 to more than 36,000.
Much of its population were second and third-generation children of European immigrants who had settled in Detroit in the early 20th century.
These included many Jewish Americans descended from immigrant ancestors from the Russian Empire, including present-day Poland and Ukraine.
Major civic improvements in this period included construction of an outdoor swimming pool and an ice rink in Major Park (now known as Shepherd Park, after former mayor David Shepherd, but long known informally as Oak Park Park).
In 1995 Detroit based window manufacturer, WeatherGard moved its headquarters to Oak Park.
In 2002 and 2004, the city annexed portions of neighboring Royal Oak Township to expand its land and tax base.
On November 8, 2011 the citizens of Oak Park elected a new mayor, Marian McClellan.
Mayor McClellan is the city's first new mayor in 22 years, replacing the long-serving Jerry Naftaly.
In April 2015, the city approved the development of a new FedEx distribution center which will be located on a 60-acre plot of land at the site of the former Detroit Artillery Armory.
On May 5, 2015 the citizens of Oak Park voted to allow mixed drinks to be sold at businesses within city limits; in addition to beer and wine which was previously allowed.
On November 3, 2015 the citizens of Oak Park re-elected Marian McClellan who was running against Aaron Tobin, who was also running for the position of Mayor of Oak Park.

========,2,Education.
Oak Park's educational history began with the Clinton School, a one-room schoolhouse on property donated by Barney Clinton in the early 20th century.
As the population grew rapidly, Clinton School was expanded and more elementary schools were built, particularly beginning in the 1950s.
Clinton School was made a Junior High School and another was built in the mid 1960s, then named for the great American poet Robert Frost.
At that time, one school in Oak Park had a special education department for children with learning disabilities: Lessenger Elementary School on Albany St. at Sunset St. Consequently, many families with such special children gravitated to the neighborhood surrounding Lessenger, creating a "cluster" of such families rarely found elsewhere.
Educational achievement was the long consistent pattern in Oak Park.
Over 85% of Oak Park High School graduates continued their education immediately after high school, whether in college, or in trade or vocational schools.
In the 1950s and 1960s the school system was renowned statewide due to the efforts of progressive and dedicated teachers and community support which liberally allocated tax dollars to fund education through voter approved bond issues.
The high school had an average score of 3.8 on the state's MEAP test in 2011.
This was one of the lowest scores in Oakland County.
Students residing between 10 Mile Rd.
and 11 Mile Rd.
are in the Berkley School District.
A square mile on the east end of Oak Park is in the neighboring Ferndale School District; the majority of the city is in Oak Park Schools.
========,2,Controversy.
In July 2011 the City of Oak Park charged Julie Bass, a homeowner, for growing vegetables in her front yard.
The vegetables were tomatoes, zucchinis, and peppers.
In March 2015, Stephanie Sumner and Michael Sumner were fired from their positions as city employees after the city had discovered that the two had stolen $433,000 from the city over the course of two years.
Several months after the story broke, the city announced that the stolen funds had been replaced through the city's insurance policy.
However, many residents voiced their concerns regarding the potential insurance rate hikes that would occur after an insurance claim to replace the stolen money.
