Satartia is a village in Yazoo County, Mississippi.
The population was 68 at the 2000 census.
Located on the east bank of the Yazoo River, Satartia was once a thriving river port, and is one of the oldest non-Native settlements in Yazoo County.
========,2,History.
Satartia is a Choctaw word meaning "pumpkin place", likely due to the small gourds that grow in the area.
In the early 1800s, Satartia was a busy shipping point from which cotton was transported by steamboat to New Orleans along the Yazoo River.
During the Civil War, General Grant sailed a gunboat from Vicksburg and captured the village; the Wilson House on Plum Street was used as his headquarters during the occupation.
The war also produced the "Satartia Rifles", a well-regarded Confederate regiment and recruitment group.
Currently there is one small country grocery store and a cotton processing gin in Satartia.
The Emmaus (Christian) Retreat Center is located at the nearby No Mistake Plantation.
