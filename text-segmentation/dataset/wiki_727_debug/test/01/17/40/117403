========,2,History.
In 1946, Byington Ford and his brother, Tirey Ford, developed the Carmel Valley Village and Airway Market, first known as the General Store, a barber shop, a drug store and soda fountain, a beauty shop, and a liquor store.
All were in walking distance of the Airpark and decorated to resemble a Mexican village.
Byrington Ford recorded house lots adjacent to the airfield that would constitute a village of "hangar houses",and his brother Tirey built a prototype hangar house off Ford Road at the west end of the airfield to serve as an example for the airborne community of the future.
Following the War it became apparent that there would not be a plane in every garage,so Ford had to adjust his enterprise, combining sales to plane owners with sales to home seekers,and he enjoyed a brisk trade.
Only 2 true hangar houses were ever built at Carmel Valley Airport: Tirey's (which later burned), and one other, still standing, on the north side of the runway.
Non-pilots bought up many of the runway Airpark sites, and to suit their many tastes Byington created ranch-house sites of 1-3 acres and envisioned hillside homes where residents could look down on incoming planes.
A clubhouse built for the Airpark later became an integral part of the Village's Blue Sky Lodge.
The Monterey County Board of Supervisors was intent on shutting down the airport,and a handful of Carmel Valley residents also aligned themselves toward the same goal.
A group of local pilots & concerned citizens formed the Carmel Valley Historic Airpark Society (CVHAS) in 2000,grabbed some petitions, started talking to the neighbors & set out to fight city hall.
In a fitting ironic twist, the CVHAS used one of city hall's favorite tactics to push their cause - they turned to environmental protection - a strategy not commonly used to protect an airport.
The airport was shut down in 2002.
Now the airport is used by local residents as a park and for modelers to fly remote controlled planes.
The village is about 12 miles from the mouth of Carmel Valley.
