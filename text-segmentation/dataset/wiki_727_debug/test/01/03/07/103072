========,2,Early history (1910-1950).
The first BSA Troop in Louisiana was founded in 1912 in Lake Charles, LA.
Troop 1 of the Calcasieu area Council was the first troop west of the Mississippi and was led by Scoutmaster Seaman A. Mayo.
Today Troop 1 is Troop 5 of First United Methodist Church, Lake Charles Louisiana.
Until 1974, some southern councils of the Boy Scouts of America were racially segregated.
(The Old Hickory council did not integrate until 1974.)
Negro Troops, as they were officially known, were sometimes given little support from Districts and Councils.
Some Scouting executives and leaders believed that black scouts and leaders would be less able to live up to the ideals of the Boy Scouts.
In the days of segregation, five of the seven Louisiana councils maintained a separate summer camp for Negro scouts and the other two ran a special session at the regular council camp in order that black scouts would not be denied a camping program.
In the period 1957-1967, each of the "Negro Scout Camps" were closed and the regular councils camps were integrated.
Negro camps in Louisiana were: Camp Pioneer (Norwela Council), Camp Britton (Ouachita Valley Council), Camp Chenier (Evangeline Area Council), Indian Village Scout Camp (New Orleans Area Council), and Camp Carver (Istrouma Area Council).
========,2,Baden-Powell Service Association.
The Baden-Powell Service Association (BPSA) was formed in the U.S. in 2006 as an independent and traditional-style Scouting Association, perpetuating the principles and practices of Scouting laid down by Robert Baden-Powell in 1907.
BPSA's aim is to promote good citizenship and physical, mental, and moral development, as well as training in habits of observation, discipline, self-reliance, loyalty, and useful skills.
The BPSA is totally independent of, and not affiliated with, either the Boy Scouts of America or the Girls Scouts of the USA, and are members of the World Federation of Independent Scouts (WFIS).
It is not in competition with other American Scouting associations, but rather offers an alternative that focuses on traditional scoutcraft, and is distinguished by wearing the traditional brown or dark green scout uniform with campaign hat.
The BPSA is coed and accepts both boys and girls into its scouting ranks.
There is one Baden-Powell Service Association local group in Louisiana, the 39th Cypress Scouts located in New Orleans.

========,5,Hurricane Katrina, and the Chilantakoba Tradition of Service.
Before the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, Chilantakoba Lodge was the largest Order of the Arrow Lodge in its Section.
The membership peaked around 600, but following the storm fell to nearly 100.
The Council's camp, and much of the area it serves, was impacted severely.
There were downed trees, damaged buildings, destroyed trails, and loss of many other assets on the Council's property.
Members of Chilantakoba Lodge helped in the resurrection of the Council Camp, Salmen Scout Reservation, and helped to staff the summer program, putting on three weeks of Boy Scout summer camp.
It is this level of dedication, and desire to serve, that has caused Chilantakoba Lodge to produce three Lodge Chiefs who have later gone on to receive the Distinguished Service Award, the highest award for service to the Order.
