========,1,preface.
Politics of East Timor takes place in a framework of a semi-presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the Prime Minister of East Timor is the head of government and the President of East Timor exercises the functions of head of state.
East Timor has a multi-party system.
Executive power is exercised by the president and the government.
Legislative power is vested in both the government and the National Parliament.
The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.
The East Timorese constitution was modelled on that of Portugal, though the president is less powerful than his Portuguese counterpart.
The country is still in the process of building its administration and governmental institutions.
========,2,Executive branch.
The head of state of the East Timorese republic is the President, who is directly elected by popular vote for a five-year term and whose executive powers are somewhat limited by the constitution, though he or she is able to veto legislation, which can be overridden by the parliament.
Following elections, the president usually appoints as the prime minister, the leader of the majority party or majority coalition.
As head of government the prime minister presides over the cabinet.
========,2,Legislative branch.
The unicameral Timorese National Parliament ("Parlamento Nacional") has 65 members elected by proportional representation (d'Hondt method) for a five-year term.
The number of seats can vary from a minimum of 52 to a maximum of 65, though it exceptionally had 88 members during its first term which also exceptionally lasted six years – from 2001 to 2007 – this was because the constitution provided that the 88-member Constitutional Assembly would become the first parliament after the constitution entered into force in 2002.
The East Timorese constitution was modelled on that of Portugal.
The country is still in the process of building its administration and governmental institutions.
========,2,Administrative divisions.
East Timor is divided into thirteen administrative districts:
The districts are subdivided into 65 subdistricts, 443 sucos and 2,336 towns, villages and hamlets.
