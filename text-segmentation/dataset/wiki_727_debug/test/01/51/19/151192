========,2,History.
League City was settled at the former site of a Karankawa Indian village.
Three families, the Butlers, Cowarts, and Perkinses, are considered to be founding families of the city.
The Cowart family settled on a creek now called Cowart's Creek after them (now often called "Coward's Creek").
The Perkins family built on a creek notably lined with magnolia trees, and named it Magnolia Bayou.
The Butler family settled inland.
The first resident of the town proper, George W. Butler, arrived from Louisiana in 1873 and settled at the junction of Clear Creek and Chigger Bayou.
The area was known as Butler's Ranch or Clear Creek until J. C. League acquired the land from a man named Muldoon on his entering the priesthood.
League laid out his town site along the Galveston, Houston, and Henderson Railroad, already established in the area.
This began a small feud over the name, as Butler was the postmaster.
The name was changed several times, alternating between Clear Creek and the new League City.
In the end, League City was chosen.
In 1907, League had two railroad flatcars of live oak trees left by the railroad tracks.
These were for the residents to plant on their property.
Butler and his son Milby supervised the planting of these trees, now known as the Butler Oaks.
Many of them line Main Street to this day.
In the 2000s, rising real estate costs in Galveston forced many families to move to other areas, including League City.
This meant an influx of children out of Galveston ISD and into other school districts like Clear Creek ISD and Dickinson ISD.
In July 2013 the financial website NerdWallet named League City the best city in Texas for people looking for jobs.

League City became an incorporated city in 1962.
League City’s government consists of seven council members and the mayor.

The City's charter is purported to be a strong mayor form of government, but this issue has been debated for years.
By ordinance, a city administrator position was created under Mayor Leonard Cruse.
The administrator’s position does not carry the authority of a city manager under a council manager form of government.
This administrator position does not have authority to conduct the city’s business without the constant approval of council and mayor.
This ordinance has created a form of government recently referred to "Hybrid" of strong mayor and council manager forms of government.
In 2011 an officer accused the police chief, Michael Jez, of giving officers ticket quotas, which are illegal in the state of Texas.
In November city council voted to place Chief Jez on administrative leave.
The council did not give a reason and Jez cited philosophical differences for the separation.
Much speculation was made that the decision was a reaction to the allegation made but neither side ever admitted to any wrongdoing.
In 2014, the police department moved to a new joint Public Safety Building that is shared with Police and Fire administration as well as housing the police department, dispatch, and the city jail.
The building is across the street from the old police department that now houses other city offices that were previously in leased space.
The city held an open house in January 2015 to serve as a grand open to the public and allowing citizens to come see the inner workings of the police department.
