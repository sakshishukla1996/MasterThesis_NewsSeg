========,2,Stevenson Depot.
The Stevenson Railroad Depot Museum, located in downtown Stevenson, is dedicated to preserving an important part of railroading history through the display of related artifacts.
In addition, the museum displays artifacts recalling Native American culture, pioneer life, and Civil War events.
The depot, which was built in 1872 and listed in the National Register of Historic Places, stands on the ruins of Stevenson's first railroad depot, which was built around 1852 for common use by the Nashville Chattanooga and the Memphis & Charleston Railroads.
That original depot was destroyed either during, or shortly after, the Civil War.
Bricks salvaged may have been used in the building of the present structure.
========,2,Fort Harker.
Constructed by the Union Army in summer 1862 and expanded in 1864, using soldiers and freed slaves, Fort Harker was built on a broad hill a quarter-mile east of the town of Stevenson.
It overlooked Crow Creek and was well within firing range of Stevenson’s strategic railroad lines, supply depots and warehouses.
Ft. Harker was an earthen redoubt, square, with walls that were high, surrounded by an dry moat.
It contained 7 cannon platforms, a bomb-proof powder magazine, a draw-bridge entrance and an 8-sided wooden blockhouse at its center.
Fort Harker was critical to Union plans.
No major fighting occurred here, but skirmishes and sniper attacks were common as territory traded hands between Union and Confederate forces.
One other large fort, two smaller redoubts and at least seven blockhouses were constructed along the railroad lines at Stevenson during the Civil War.
Stevenson was the major junction for the Memphis and Charleston Railroad and the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad.
In addition to forts, the Union Army established a medical facility and a refugee camp at Stevenson.
The remains of Gen. Rosecrans’ headquarters is on the National Register of Historic Places.
Both may be seen near downtown Stevenson today.
