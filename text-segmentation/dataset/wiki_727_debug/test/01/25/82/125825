========,1,preface.
Phillipsburg is a town in Warren County, New Jersey, United States, a sister city to the cross-Delaware River industrial partner of Easton, Pennsylvania.
The town is located along the Delaware River in western New Jersey, on the border with Pennsylvania, and is considered part of the Delaware Valley region and the eastern border of the Lehigh Valley region.
The Norfolk Southern Railway's Lehigh Line (formerly the main line of the Lehigh Valley Railroad with a mix of main line trackage combined long leased to the Central Railroad of New Jersey by its builder Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company), runs through Phillipsburg on its way cross river to Easton, Pennsylvania.
The Belvidere Delaware Railroad was leased (1871) and later acquired by the Pennsylvania Railroad connecting the lower Poconos to Trenton, New Jersey and Philadelphia.
As of 2010 United States Census, the town's population was 14,950, reflecting a decline of 216 (-1.4%) from the 15,166 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn declined by 591 (-3.8%) from the 15,757 counted in the 1990 Census.
========,2,History.
The town grew from a sleepy agricultural village (in 1824), and was transformed into a transportation hub and shipping center as the Delaware terminus of the Morris Canal (1829-1924), the first transportation infrastructure project (of several, each eventually) giving the community a direct connection to New York City.
The Central Railroad of New Jersey would soon follow with a connection, but the community's growth (and for a long while, its importance) was that it reached the canal terminals of both the Delaware Canal and the Lehigh Canal by its cross-river cable ferry system to Easton, PA.
In 1853, the Lehigh Valley Railroad connected across the river with the CNJ and a passenger shortline railroad, the Belvidere Delaware Railroad, as well as the Morris Canal, all within Phillipsburg.
Rapid growth followed quickly.
Phillipsburg was incorporated as a town by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 8, 1861, from portions of Phillipsburg Township (now Lopatcong Township).
The town was named for William Phillips, an early settler of the area.

========,2,Economy.
========,3,Industrial history.
Phillipsburg had historically benefited from being a major transportation hub, situated at the confluence of the Delaware and Lehigh rivers.
Phillipsburg served as the western terminus of the Morris Canal for approximately 100 years from the 1820s to 1920s, which connected the city by water to the industrial and consumer centers of the New York City area, with connections westward via the Lehigh Canal and Delaware Canal across the Delaware.
Long gone is the era of canal shipping and many of the important freight railways that served the area have gone bankrupt or bypass the city on long distance routes.
Phillipsburg was served by five major railroads: <br> 1.
Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ) <br> 2.
Lehigh & Hudson River Railroad (L&HR) <br> 3.
Lehigh Valley Railroad (LVRR)<br> 4.
Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Phillipsburg Branch (DL&W) <br> 5.
Pennsylvania Railroad Belvidere Division (PRR).
========,3,Economic revival.
Most of the manufacturing jobs have left Warren County's largest city.
In 1994, the New Jersey Legislature designated Phillipsburg as an Urban Enterprise Zone community.
This zoning offers tax incentives and other benefits to Phillipsburg-based businesses, as well as a 3½% sales tax rate at eligible merchants, reduced from the 7% rate charged statewide.
In recent years, some businesses have begun to move into the center of the city.
Rising real estate prices indicate that these legislative stimulants have been somewhat effective.
Phillipsburg has been selected as a site for the New Jersey Railroad and Transportation Heritage Center (jointly with Netcong), a museum designed to help preserve and showcase the state's transportation history.
========,3,Railway.
A tourist railroad known as the Belvidere & Delaware River Railroad operates on the former Belvidere-Delaware Railroad Pennsylvania Railroad Branch serving excursions from Lehigh Junction Station south to Carpentersville.
Norfolk Southern serves the industrial manufacturing purposes in Phillipsburg using former LVRR tracks and the L&HR bridge to connect with the Bel-Del PRR tracks.
Since 2007, NJ Transit has been conducting a study to determine if re-establishing a commuter rail extension of the Raritan Valley Line to Phillipsburg is economically feasible.
Phillipsburg also is home to the Phillipsburg Railroad Historians museum.
They display railroad memorabilia inside the museum, an "N" scale diorama, two Lehigh & Hudson River cabooses (one of which is currently being restored) and a Jersey Central caboose.
There is a L&HR snow flanger, Tidewater tank car, a CNJ box car owned by the Anthracite Railroads Historical Society, a 1922 Chestnut Ridge Mack railbus owned by the Lehigh Valley NRHS, a Public Service trolley owned by the North Jersey Electric Railway Historical Society, a 44-ton GE locomotive and a 25-ton GE locomotive.
