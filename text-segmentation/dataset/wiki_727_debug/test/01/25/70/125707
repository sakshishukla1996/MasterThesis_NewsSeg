Bernardsville was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 6, 1924, from portions of Bernards Township, based on the results of a referendum held on April 29, 1924.
The borough was named for Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet, who served as governor of the Province of New Jersey.
Bernardsville is often mispronounced as "Bern-ARDS-ville" as opposed to the correct parochial pronunciation "BERN-ards-ville".
In 2009, part of the borough was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Olcott Avenue Historic District.
========,2,History.
Bernardsville was originally a section of Bernards Township known as Vealtown.
In 1840, Vealtown became Bernardsville, named after Sir Francis Bernard, Colonial governor of New Jersey from 1758 to 1760.
Located in the northernmost part of Somerset County, just south of Morristown, the borough includes some of the last vestiges of the Great Eastern Forest.
During the Revolutionary War, General Charles Lee rested his troops in Vealtown around the night of December 12 to 13, 1776.
General Lee and some of his guard spent the night about southeast at White's Inn on the southeast side of Basking Ridge, near the manor house of Continental Army general William Alexander, Lord Stirling.
On the morning of December 13, General Lee was captured by the British and removed to New York.
After the Civil War, many wealthy and prominent New Yorkers moved into the area, first as summer visitors, then as permanent residents of the Bernardsville Mountain.
The Gladstone Branch railroad line was built through Bernardsville in 1872 and played an important role in the borough's development.
Bernardsville did not become an independent municipality until 1924, when it split from Bernards Township.
The New Jersey State Review Board for Historic Sites recommended the creation of the Olcott Avenue historic district on February 10, 2009.
While the Olcott Avenue School is but one historic structure within Bernardsville's first historic district area, the area's appeal and historic significance is part of the story of the rise of the middle class in Bernardsville and how this particular location impacted the entire region, from the downtown, Little Italy, and the Mountain Colony areas.
