However, the area had been settled for years before that, first being established as a river town in the mid-18th century.
It is Yell County's dual county seat, sharing that title with Danville.
The Treaty of Council Oaks was signed on June 24, 1823 on what is now Front Street beneath two huge oak trees (102 feet high and 400–500 years old).
Under orders of President James Monroe, U.S. Army Colonel David Brearly and Arkansas territorial secretary Robert Crittendon met with Chief Black Fox and several Cherokee leaders to determine boundaries.
As a result of the treaty, the Cherokees gave up all of their land in Arkansas south of the Arkansas River.
One of the trees was destroyed in the early 1990s in a flood, but the other is still standing.
The site is now a city park.
