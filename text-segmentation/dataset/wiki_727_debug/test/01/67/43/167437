========,1,preface.
Hemispheres is the sixth studio album by Canadian rock band Rush, released in 1978.
The album was recorded at Rockfield Studios in Wales and mixed at Trident Studios in London.
It was the last of two albums they would record in the United Kingdom before returning to their homes in Canada.
========,2,Overview.
Following themes going back to Rush's third album, "Caress of Steel", on "Hemispheres" lyricist Neil Peart continued to utilize fantasy and science fiction motifs.
Similar to their 1976 release, "2112", the title track on "Hemispheres" takes up the entire first side of the album, and is a suite of songs telling a story - in this case, a continuation of the story begun in "Cygnus X-1 Book I: The Voyage" on the band's previous album "A Farewell to Kings".
The second side consists of two conventional tracks, "Circumstances" and "The Trees," and the band's first standalone instrumental, "La Villa Strangiato."
According to drummer Neil Peart, they spent more time recording "La Villa Strangiato" than they did recording the entire "Fly by Night" album.
The album contains examples of Rush's adherence to progressive rock standards including the use of fantasy lyrics, multi-movement song structures, and complex rhythms and time signatures.
In the 2010 documentary film "", the band members comment that the stress of recording "Hemispheres" was a major factor in their decision to start moving away from suites and long-form pieces in their songwriting.
That change in philosophy would manifest itself in the band's next album, the considerably more accessible "Permanent Waves".
The band's seventh album would mark their commercial success, paving the way for the multi-platinum "Moving Pictures".
For a short period of time, the album was available in Canada also as a red vinyl LP in a gatefold sleeve with poster (catalogue number SANR-1-1015), and as a limited edition picture disc (catalogue number SRP-1300).
========,2,Commercial performance.
Although "Hemispheres" received good reviews and became Rush's fourth consecutive gold album in the United States, it proved to be a weaker seller than many of the group's other albums.
It peaked at No.
47 on the "Billboard" 200, becoming the last Rush studio album to fail to make the Billboard Top 10 until 1987's "Hold Your Fire".
"Hemispheres" would not reach US platinum status until December 1993, over 15 years after its initial release.
========,2,1997 remaster.
A remaster was issued in 1997.
***LIST***.
"Hemispheres" was remastered again in 2011 by Andy VanDette for the "Sector" box sets, which re-released all of Rush's Mercury-era albums.
"Hemispheres" is included in the "Sector 2" set.
"Hemispheres" was remastered for vinyl in 2015 by Sean Magee at Abbey Road Studios as a part of the official "12 Months of Rush" promotion.
The high definition master prepared for this release was also made available for purchase in 24-bit/96 kHz and 24-bit/192 kHz formats, at several high-resolution audio online music stores.
These masters have significantly less dynamic range compression than the 1997 remasters and the "Sector" remasters by Andy VanDette.
