========,1,preface.
Huron is a city in Erie County, Ohio, United States.
The population was 7,149 at the 2010 census.
It is part of the Sandusky, Ohio Metropolitan Statistical Area.
Huron Township surrounds the City of Huron.
========,2,History and culture.
Huron Township was at the center of the "Firelands" region of the Connecticut Western Reserve, lands that were offered to residents of Connecticut who had lost property to British forces during the American Revolutionary War.
The first permanent settler in the area that became Huron Township was a Quebec-born trapper, trader and interpreter named John Baptiste Flammond ("Fleming"), who established a trading post about a mile inland along the east bank of the Huron River in 1805.
Other French traders had preceded him, including Gabriel Hunot in the 1780s.
Huron Township was established in 1809.
Huron Village was later established when a town plat was drawn and port facilities at the mouth of the Huron River were developed between 1821 and 1824; and the town quickly became a major shipbuilding center in the 1830s.
The current community of Huron is often mistaken to have been the same as the "town plat of Huron" (also known as "the old County Seat" village), which was established in 1815, and was actually within the present Milan Township (formerly known as Avery Township before 1821).
The Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad greatly expanded Huron's port on the east bank of the Huron River beginning in 1880.
The first cargo of iron ore at the W&LE docks was received May 21, 1884.
The port is still in use today, accepting cargoes of iron ore and limestone from lake freighters.
Huron was also the home port of several commercial fishing fleets before unbridled lake pollution decimated the industry on Lake Erie by the early 1970s.
Water quality in Lake Erie has greatly improved as a result of strong environmental controls since then and sport fishing has increased in popularity in the area.
However, the Lake faces new threats from algal blooms and several invasive species such as zebra mussels and Asian carp that may impact sport fishing in the future.
========,2,Business/Urban Renewal.
Commercial and industrial development of Huron had historically been centered around the riverfront port area.
By the early 1960s a busy downtown business district had developed, serving local residents and summer tourists.
However, with improvements to U.S. Route 6 and Ohio Route 2 bypassing the downtown area and enabling quicker travel to larger neighboring cities, downtown Huron went into decline.
Starting in 1967, the City of Huron embarked on a controversial urban renewal program with funding from various programs of the U.S. federal government, such as the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the State of Ohio.
The city purchased, in some cases by eminent domain, and demolished 38 commercial buildings and private homes.
It then built a municipal marina, called the Huron Boat Basin, as the focal point of a new downtown.
While the "Boat Basin" has become a popular community park and gathering place, extensive redevelopment of the downtown area did not occur as quickly as envisioned.
New industry and commercial development has more recently occurred on the southern and western city limits and suburbs.
========,3,The ConAgra Project.
On July 18, 2006, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) announced the purchase of the ConAgra Foods facility in Huron.
Concurrently, ConAgra Foods announced the closure of the grain elevator.
The 19.8-acre (80,000 m2) parcel is a key piece of Huronâ€™s waterfront.
The Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR), Division of Watercraft has completed a public boating and fishing access site with launch ramps, docks and parking facilities.
The City of Huron assumed title to the former grain silos and flour mill and received a grant to demolish the building, which was completed in August, 2012.
It envisions a future riverfront development to include restaurants, retail stores, condominiums and greenspace.
On January 8, 2012, much of the former Con-Agra mill structure was demolished by implosion in a public event attracting media attention and a large crowd.
The former grain silos were removed by manual demolition.
========,2,College/University Education.
BGSU Firelands, a branch campus of Bowling Green State University, is located just west of the city limits.
A separate college of the Bowling Green State University system, BGSU Firelands has been a regional campus of Bowling Green since 1968.
Over 2,000 students in 2006 were enrolled for a wide variety of associate, bachelors and graduate degree programs.
Huron is also the home of the "Huron Playhouse", formerly a division of Bowling Green State University's Department of Theater and Film and now an independent, non-profit corporation.
It holds plays in the auditorium of McCormick Middle/Junior High School and is Ohio's oldest continuing summer theater.
