Powell is an affluent city in Delaware County, Ohio, United States.
The population was 11,500 at the 2010 census.
The community was first settled around 1801, two years before Ohio became a state.
It was named "Middlebury" at the time, because the first settlers came from the Middlebury, Connecticut area.
In 1857, Judge Thomas Powell established the first post office in the community, and the residents decided to adopt his name.
The town of Powell had its start in the building of the railroad through that territory.
Powell was finally incorporated as a municipality in 1947.
The population remained small until the late 1980s, when residential development expanding from the northern Columbus metropolitan area reached Powell.
In twenty years, the population rose from less than 400 to over 6,000.
In July 2005, CNN Money and "Money" magazine ranked Powell 18 on its list of the 100 Best Places to Live in the United States.<ref name="CNN/Money and "Money" magazine"></ref>

Powell is home to typical midwestern restaurants and supermarkets, but due to the wishes of the residents, past and present, does not host any major industrial, financial, or technological businesses.
This is apparent through the infamous "Wal-Mart dispute," during which a group of citizens formed the "Community Oversight Foundation" to fight against Wal-Mart on the grounds that Wal-Mart would be detrimental to the preservation of the historic nature of Powell and would harm the current property values.
However, in adjoining Liberty Township, the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium and its water park Zoombezi Bay, O'Shaughnessy Dam, and the historic Olentangy Indian Caverns, offer residents and visitors alike, entertainment and recreational options.
Powell is officially a city and is thus authorized by the laws of the State of Ohio to form a city school district.

Powell is home to one of Olentangy Local School Districts high schools, which is Olentangy Liberty High School.
Powell is also home to a kindergarten to grade twelve private preparatory school Village Academy, and to a branch of the Delaware County District Library.
Although Powell maintains its own police department, it is served by the Liberty Township Fire Department, which has two stations less than one mile from the northern and western borders of the city.
Liberty Township Fire Department or LTFD has been serving Powell since 1947 and both stations are maintained by a 24/7 staff of firefighters.
Station 321 has a Ladder, Medic and Engine and other apparatus and is located on Liberty Road, Station 322 has an engine medic and air unit, they are located off of Sawmill Parkway, they have a distinct slogan "First Due At The Zoo", because the Columbus Zoo is located almost a mile away.
