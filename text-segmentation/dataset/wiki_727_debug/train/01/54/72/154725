In probability and statistics, a probability mass function (pmf) is a function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value.
The probability mass function is often the primary means of defining a discrete probability distribution, and such functions exist for either scalar or multivariate random variables whose domain is discrete.
A probability mass function differs from a probability density function (pdf) in that the latter is associated with continuous rather than discrete random variables; the values of the continuous random variables are not probabilities as such: a pdf must be integrated over an interval to yield a probability.
========,2,Formal definition.
Suppose that "X": "S" → "A" (A ***formula*** R) is a discrete random variable defined on a sample space "S".
Then the probability mass function "f": "A" → [0, 1] for "X" is defined as Thinking of probability as mass helps to avoid mistakes since the physical mass is conserved as is the total probability for all hypothetical outcomes "x":
When there is a natural order among the hypotheses "x", it may be convenient to assign numerical values to them (or "n"-tuples in case of a discrete multivariate random variable) and to consider also values not in the image of "X".
That is, "f" may be defined for all real numbers and "f"("x") = 0 for all "x" ***formula*** "X"("S") as shown in the figure.
Since the image of "X" is countable, the probability mass function "f"("x") is zero for all but a countable number of values of "x".
The discontinuity of probability mass functions is related to the fact that the cumulative distribution function of a discrete random variable is also discontinuous.
Where it is differentiable, the derivative is zero, just as the probability mass function is zero at all such points.
========,2,Examples.
Suppose that "S" is the sample space of all outcomes of a single toss of a fair coin, and "X" is the random variable defined on "S" assigning 0 to "tails" and 1 to "heads".
Since the coin is fair, the probability mass function is This is a special case of the binomial distribution, the Bernoulli distribution.
An example of a multivariate discrete distribution, and of its probability mass function, is provided by the multinomial distribution.
