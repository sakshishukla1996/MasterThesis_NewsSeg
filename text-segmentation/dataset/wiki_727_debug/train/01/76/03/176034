Ely won the role of Tarzan in 1966 after playing various supporting parts in films such as "South Pacific" (1958), as an airplane navigator, "The Fiend Who Walked the West" (1958) and "The Remarkable Mr. Pennypacker" (1959), as well as a guest-starring role on Barbara Eden's first television series, the romantic comedy "How to Marry a Millionaire".
During the filming of "Tarzan", Ely did virtually all of his stunts for the series, and suffered two dozen major injuries in the process, including two broken shoulders and various lion bites.
Ely's height (6' 4") and athletic build also won him the title role in the film "" (1975), as well as various guest shots.
In a 1978 "Fantasy Island" episode, for example, Ely portrayed Mark Antony in a Roman military short tunic and breastplate that displayed almost as much of his physique as his Tarzan costume had.
From 1960 to 1961, Ely starred on the series "The Aquanauts", and the western adventure film "The Night of the Grizzly" (1966) opposite Clint Walker, and later appeared in Jürgen Goslar's slavery movie "Slavers" (1978), with Trevor Howard, Britt Ekland and Ray Milland.
In the 1980s, Ely hosted the musical game show "Face the Music", as well as the 1980 and 1981 Miss America Pageants, replacing longtime host Bert Parks.
Later in the decade, Ely starred in a 1987–88 revival of the 1960s adventure series "Sea Hunt" as Mike Nelson, the role played by Lloyd Bridges in the original series.
In the 1990s, Ely’s roles included a retired Superman from an alternate reality in the 1991 two-part episode "The Road to Hell" of the "Superboy" syndicated television series, and a big game hunter named Gordon Shaw in the 1992 episode "Tarzan the Hunted" of the syndicated "Tarzán" TV series (starring Wolf Larson).
Until about 2001, Ely made appearances on popular TV shows, his most recent being "Sheena" and "Renegade".
He had retired from acting in 2001, but as reported by the IMDb, he recently returned to acting with an appearance in the television movie "Expecting Amish" (2014).
