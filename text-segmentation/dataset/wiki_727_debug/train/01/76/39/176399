The Zeeman effect (; ), named after the Dutch physicist Pieter Zeeman, is the effect of splitting a spectral line into several components in the presence of a static magnetic field.
It is analogous to the Stark effect, the splitting of a spectral line into several components in the presence of an electric field.
Also similar to the Stark effect, transitions between different components have, in general, different intensities, with some being entirely forbidden (in the dipole approximation), as governed by the selection rules.
Since the distance between the Zeeman sub-levels is a function of the magnetic field, this effect can be used to measure the magnetic field, e.g.
that of the Sun and other stars or in laboratory plasmas.
The Zeeman effect is very important in applications such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, electron spin resonance spectroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Mössbauer spectroscopy.
It may also be utilized to improve accuracy in atomic absorption spectroscopy.
A theory about the magnetic sense of birds assumes that a protein in the retina is changed due to the Zeeman effect.
When the spectral lines are absorption lines, the effect is called inverse Zeeman effect.
========,2,Nomenclature.
Historically, one distinguishes between the normal and an anomalous Zeeman effect (discovered by Thomas Preston in Dublin, Ireland ).
The anomalous effect appears on transitions where the net spin of the electrons is an odd half-integer, so that the number of Zeeman sub-levels is even.
It was called "anomalous" because the electron spin had not yet been discovered, and so there was no good explanation for it at the time that Zeeman observed the effect.
At higher magnetic fields the effect ceases to be linear.
At even higher field strength, when the strength of the external field is comparable to the strength of the atom's internal field, electron coupling is disturbed and the spectral lines rearrange.
This is called the Paschen-Back effect.
In the modern scientific literature, these terms are rarely used, with a tendency to use just the "Zeeman effect".

The Lyman alpha transition in hydrogen in the presence of the spin-orbit interaction involves the transitions
In the presence of an external magnetic field, the weak-field Zeeman effect splits the 1S and 2P levels into 2 states each (***formula***) and the 2P level into 4 states (***formula***).
The Landé g-factors for the three levels are:
Note in particular that the size of the energy splitting is different for the different orbitals, because the g values are different.
On the left, fine structure splitting is depicted.
This splitting occurs even in the absence of a magnetic field, as it is due to spin-orbit coupling.
Depicted on the right is the additional Zeeman splitting, which occurs in the presence of magnetic fields.

George Ellery Hale was the first to notice the Zeeman effect in the solar spectra, indicating the existence of strong magnetic fields in sunspots.
Such fields can be quite high, on the order of 0.1 tesla or higher.
Today, the Zeeman effect is used to produce magnetograms showing the variation of magnetic field on the sun.
