========,2,Theory of operation.
Most commercial units are self-balancing in the direction of travel only (single axis) with lateral stability being provided by the rider; more complex fully self-balancing dual-axis devices also need to self-balance from side to side.
The control mechanisms of both use control moment gyroscopes, reaction wheels and/or auxiliary pendulums and can be considered to be inverted pendulum.

========,2,History.
========,3,Early experimentation.
Richard C. Hemming patented a hand-power monowheel is 1869, and in 1885 a patent was received for a pedal-power version.
Various motorized monowheels were developed and demonstrated during the 1930s without commercial success.
In 1964 Charles F Taylor was granted a patent for a 'vehicle having a single supporting and driving wheel' after some 25 years of experimentation.
========,3,Commercialisation.
In 2003, Bombardier announced a conceptual design for such a device used as a sport vehicle, the Embrio.
In September 2004 Trevor Blackwell demonstrated a functional self-balancing unicycle, using the control-mechanism similar to that used by the Segway PT and published the designs as the Eunicycle.
In 2006 Aleksander Polutnik demonstrated a first two-axis balancing human-ridable unicycle, the Enicycle.
In 2008, Focus Designs released the first commercially available self-balancing unicycle and RYNO Motors demonstrated their prototype unit.
In 2010 Shane Chen filed a patent for a compact seatless device which his company, Inventis launched in 2011.
Late in 2015, the Ford Motor Company patented a "self-propelled unicycle engagable with vehicle", intended for last-mile commuters.
========,2,Use and regulation by country.
========,3,Europe.
========,4,Germany.
It is not legal to ride solowheels on public roads (includes sidewalks, parks, forest tracks, etc.)
in Germany as of June 2017.
Because it is considered as a type of motor vehicle the rider would need a test certificate from the Technical Inspection Agency (Technischer Ãœberwachungsverein) to get an insurance.
Additionally, the driver would have to pay taxes according to the certificate.
However, the Inspection Agency has no valid classification for it, no certificate can be obtained.
Hence, riding a solowheel on public road would mean to ride without certificate, without insurance and to evade taxes.
It may have severe penalties (up to one year in prison ) when a solowheel rider is caught by the police.
In contrast, for the Seqway as a two-wheeled vehicle with handlebar, there is a classification which allows to get a certificate and thus, the compulsory insurance.
========,4,United Kingdom.
In England and Wales use on the pavement (sidewalk) is banned under Section 72 of the Highway Act 1835.
With reference to its use of the carriageway (roadway) it probably falls into the category of 'motor vehicle' (defined as 'a mechanically propelled vehicle, intended or adapted for use on roads' by section 136 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984) and as such would be covered by the Road Vehicles (Construction & Use) Regulations 1986 and hence approval through European Community Whole Vehicle Type Approval.
The government has been petitioned to allow these devices on the road.
In Scotland, it is illegal to ride on public pavements (sidewalks) under the Roads Act, 1984.
