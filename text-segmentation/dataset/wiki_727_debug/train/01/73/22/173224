========,1,preface.
In geometry, a normal is an object such as a line or vector that is perpendicular to a given object.
For example, in the two-dimensional case, the normal line to a curve at a given point is the line perpendicular to the tangent line to the curve at the point.
In the three-dimensional case a surface normal, or simply normal, to a surface at a point "P" is a vector that is perpendicular to the tangent plane to that surface at "P".
The word "normal" is also used as an adjective: a line normal to a plane, the normal component of a force, the normal vector, etc.
The concept of normality generalizes to orthogonality.
The concept has been generalized to differentiable manifolds of arbitrary dimension embedded in a Euclidean space.
The normal vector space or normal space of a manifold at a point "P" is the set of the vectors which are orthogonal to the tangent space at "P".
In the case of differential curves, the curvature vector is a normal vector of special interest.
The normal is often used in computer graphics to determine a surface's orientation toward a light source for flat shading, or the orientation of each of the corners (vertices) to mimic a curved surface with Phong shading.

========,3,Uniqueness of the normal.
A normal to a surface does not have a unique direction; the vector pointing in the opposite direction of a surface normal is also a surface normal.
For a surface which is the topological boundary of a set in three dimensions, one can distinguish between the inward-pointing normal and outer-pointing normal, which can help define the normal in a unique way.
For an oriented surface, the surface normal is usually determined by the right-hand rule.
If the normal is constructed as the cross product of tangent vectors (as described in the text above), it is a pseudovector.
========,2,Varieties defined by implicit equations in "n"-dimensional space.
A differential variety defined by implicit equations in the "n"-dimensional space is the set of the common zeros of a finite set of differential functions in "n" variables
The Jacobian matrix of the variety is the "k"Ã—"n" matrix whose "i"-th row is the gradient of "f".
By implicit function theorem, the variety is a manifold in the neighborhood of a point of it where the Jacobian matrix has rank "k".
At such a point "P", the normal vector space is the vector space generated by the values at "P" of the gradient vectors of the "f".
In other words, a variety is defined as the intersection of "k" hypersurfaces, and the normal vector space at a point is the vector space generated by the normal vectors of the hypersurfaces at the point.
The normal (affine) space at a point "P" of the variety is the affine subspace passing through "P" and generated by the normal vector space at "P".
These definitions may be extended "verbatim" to the points where the variety is not a manifold.
========,3,Example.
Let "V" be the variety defined in the 3-dimensional space by the equations  This variety is the union of the "x"-axis and the "y"-axis.
At a point , where , the rows of the Jacobian matrix are and .
Thus the normal affine space is the plane of equation .
Similarly, if , the normal plane at is the plane of equation .
At the point the rows of the Jacobian matrix are and .
Thus the normal vector space and the normal affine space have dimension 1 and the normal affine space is the "z"-axis.
========,2,Normal in geometric optics.
The normal is the line perpendicular to the surface of an optical medium at a given point.
In reflection of light, the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection are respectively the angle between the normal and the incident ray (on the plane of incidence) and the angle between the normal and the reflected ray.
