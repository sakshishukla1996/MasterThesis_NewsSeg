========,1,preface.
The Cessna 172 Skyhawk is a four-seat, single-engine, high wing, fixed-wing aircraft made by the Cessna Aircraft Company.
First flown in 1955, more 172s have been built than any other aircraft.
Measured by its longevity and popularity, the Cessna 172 is the most successful aircraft in history.
Cessna delivered the first production model in 1956 and as of 2015, the company and its partners had built more than 43,000.
The aircraft remains in production today.
The Skyhawk's main competitors have been the Beechcraft Musketeer and Grumman AA-5 series (neither currently in production), the Piper Cherokee, and, more recently, the Diamond DA40 and Cirrus SR22.
========,2,Design and development.
The Cessna 172 started life as a tricycle landing gear variant of the taildragger Cessna 170, with a basic level of standard equipment.
In January 1955, Cessna flew an improved variant of the Cessna 170, a Continental O-300-A-powered Cessna 170C with larger elevators and a more angular tailfin.
Although the variant was tested and certified, Cessna decided to modify it with a tricycle landing gear, and the modified Cessna 170C flew again on 12 June 1955.
To reduce the time and cost of certification, the type was added to the Cessna 170 type certificate as the Model 172.
Later, the 172 was given its own type certificate, 3A12.
The 172 became an overnight sales success, and over 1,400 were built in 1956, its first full year of production.
Early 172s were similar in appearance to the 170s, with the same straight aft fuselage and tall landing gear legs, although the 172 had a straight tailfin while the 170 had a rounded fin and rudder.
In 1960, the 172A incorporated revised landing gear and the swept-back tailfin, which is still in use today.
The final aesthetic development, found in the 1963 172D and all later 172 models, was a lowered rear deck allowing an aft window.
Cessna advertised this added rear visibility as "Omni-Vision."
Production halted in the mid-1980s, but resumed in 1996 with the 160 hp (120 kW) Cessna 172R Skyhawk.
Cessna supplemented this in 1998 with the 180 hp (135 kW) Cessna 172S Skyhawk SP.
========,3,Modifications.
The Cessna 172 may be modified via a wide array of supplemental type certificates (STCs), including increased engine power and higher gross weights.
Available STC engine modifications increase power from , add constant-speed propellers, or allow the use of automobile gasoline.
Other modifications include additional fuel tank capacity in the wing tips, added baggage compartment tanks, added wheel pants to reduce drag, or enhanced landing and takeoff performance and safety with a STOL kit.
========,2,Operational history.
A Cessna 172 was used in 1958 to set the world record for flight endurance; the record still stands.
On December 4, 1958, Robert Timm and John Cook took off from McCarran Airfield in Las Vegas, Nevada, in a used Cessna 172, registration number N9172B.
They landed back at McCarran Airfield on February 4, 1959 after 64 days, 22 hours, 19 minutes and 5 seconds in flight.
The flight was part of a fund-raising effort for the Damon Runyon Cancer Fund.
Food and water were transferred by matching speeds with a chase car on a straight stretch of road in the desert, and hoisting the supplies aboard with a rope and bucket.
Fuel was taken on by hoisting a hose from a fuel truck up to the aircraft, filling an auxiliary belly tank installed for the flight, pumping that fuel into the aircraft's regular tanks and then filling the belly tank again.
The drivers steered while a second person matched speeds with the aircraft with his foot on the vehicle's accelerator pedal.
Engine oil was added by means of a tube from the cabin that was fitted to pass through the firewall.
Only the pilot's seat was installed.
The remaining space was used for a pad on which the relief pilot slept.
The right cabin door was replaced with an easy-opening, accordion-type door to allow supplies and fuel to be hoisted aboard.
Early in the flight, the engine-driven electric generator failed.
A Champion wind-driven generator (turned by a small propeller) was hoisted aboard, taped to the wing support strut, and plugged into the cigarette lighter socket; it served as the aircraft's source of electricity for the rest of the flight.
The pilots decided to end the marathon flight because with 1,558 hours of continuously running the engine during the record-setting flight, plus several hundred hours already on the engine beforehand (considerably in excess of its normal overhaul interval), the engine's power output had deteriorated to the point at which they were barely able to climb away after refueling.
The aircraft is on display in the passenger terminal at McCarran International Airport.
Photos and details of the record flight can be seen in a small museum on the upper level of the baggage claim area.
After the flight, Cook said:

The 172E also featured a redesigned instrument panel.
1,401 172Es were built that year as production continued to increase.
The 1965 model 172F introduced electrically operated flaps to replace the previous lever-operated system.
It was built in France by Reims Cessna as the F172 until 1971.
These models formed the basis for the U.S. Air Force's T-41A Mescalero primary trainer, which was used during the 1960s and early 1970s as initial flight screening aircraft in USAF Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT).
Following their removal from the UPT program, some extant USAF T-41s were assigned to the U.S. Air Force Academy for the cadet pilot indoctrination program, while others were distributed to Air Force aero clubs.
***LIST***.
The 1966 model year 172G introduced a more pointed spinner and sold for US$12,450 in its basic 172 version and US$13,300 in the upgraded Skyhawk version.
1,597 were built.
***LIST***.
The 1967 model 172H was the last Continental O-300 powered model.
It also introduced a shorter-stroke nose gear oleo to reduce drag and improve the appearance of the aircraft in flight.
A new cowling was used, introducing shock-mounts that transmitted lower noise levels to the cockpit and reduced cowl cracking.
The electric stall warning horn was replaced by a pneumatic one.
***LIST***.
The 1968 model marked the beginning of the Lycoming-powered 172s.
***LIST***.
The Cessna Company planned to drop the previous 172 configuration for the 1968 model year and replace it with a cantilever-wing/stabilator configuration that would be the 172J.
However, as time for model introduction neared, those dealers who were aware of the change began applying pressure on the factory to continue the previous configuration.
They felt the new model would be less usable as a trainer.
Consequently, and at the last minute, the decision was made to continue the 172 in its original configuration.
The planned 172J configuration would be introduced as a new model, the 177.
The deluxe option would become the 177 Cardinal.
The "J" designation was never publicly used.
The next model year was the 1969 "K" model.
The 1969 172K had a redesigned tailfin cap and reshaped rear windows.
Optional long-range wing fuel tanks were offered.
The rear windows were slightly enlarged by .
The 1969 model sold for US$12,500 for the 172 and US$13,995 for the Skyhawk, with 1,170 made.
***LIST***.
The 172L, sold during 1971 and 1972, replaced the main landing gear legs (which were originally flat spring steel) with tapered, tubular steel gear legs.
The new gear had a width that was increased by .
The new tubular gear was lighter, but required aerodynamic fairings to maintain the same speed and climb performance as experienced with the flat steel design.
The "L" also had a plastic fairing between the dorsal fin and vertical fin to introduce a greater family resemblance to the 182's vertical fin.
***LIST***.
There was no "O" ("Oscar") model 172.
The 172P, or Skyhawk P, was introduced in 1981 to solve the reliability problems of the "N" engine.
The Lycoming O-320-D2J was a great improvement.
***LIST***.
The Skyhawk R was introduced in 1996 and is powered by a derated Lycoming IO-360-L2A producing a maximum of at just 2,400 rpm.
This is the first Cessna 172 to have a factory-fitted fuel-injected engine.
***LIST***.
Cessna introduced a retractable landing gear version of the 172 in 1980 and named it the Cutlass 172RG.
========,3,Special versions.
***LIST***.
The FR172J Reims Rocket was produced by Reims Aviation in France from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s.
It was powered by a Rolls-Royce built, fuel-injected, Continental IO-360-H(B) engine with a constant-speed propeller.
***LIST***.
Model introduced in July 2014 for 2015 customer deliveries, powered by a Continental CD-155 diesel engine installed by the factory under a supplemental type certificate.
Initial retail price in 2014 was $435,000.
The model has a top speed of and burns per hour less fuel than the standard 172.
As a result, the model has a range, an increase of more than 38% over the standard 172.
This model is a development of the proposed and then cancelled Skyhawk TD.
Cessna has indicated that the JT-A will be made available in 2016.
========,3,Canceled model.
***LIST***.
On October 4, 2007 Cessna announced its plan to build a diesel-powered model, to be designated the 172 Skyhawk TD ("Turbo Diesel") starting in mid-2008.
The planned engine was to be a Thielert Centurion 2.0, liquid-cooled, two-liter displacement, dual overhead cam, four-cylinder, in-line, turbo-diesel with full authority digital engine control with an output of and burning Jet-A fuel.
In July 2013 the 172TD model was canceled due to Thielert's bankruptcy.
The aircraft was later refined into the Turbo Skyhawk JT-A, slated for deliveries in 2015.
========,3,Future models.
***LIST***.
In July 2010, Cessna announced it was developing an electrically powered 172 as a proof-of-concept in partnership with Bye Energy.
In July 2011, Bye Energy, whose name had been changed to Beyond Aviation, announced the prototype had commenced taxi tests on 22 July 2011 and a first flight would follow soon.
In 2012, the prototype, using Panacis batteries, engaged in multiple successful test flights.
========,2,Military operators.
A variant of the 172, the T-41 Mescalero was used as a trainer with the United States Air Force and Army.
In addition, the United States Border Patrol uses a fleet of 172s for aerial surveillance along the Mexico-US border.
The Irish Air Corps uses the Reims version for aerial surveillance and monitoring of cash, prisoner and explosive escorts, in addition to army cooperation and pilot training roles.
