========,2,History.
The name of Douglas was first given to the territory of the town in the year 1746.
New Sherburn or "New Sherburn Grant" had previously been its designation, since its first occupancy by the English settlers which was as early as 1715.
The original settlers came primarily from Sherburn, although many hailed from Natick as well.
New Sherburn was removed from Suffolk County (or Middlesex county?)
to Worcester County at its formation on April 2, 1731.
The name Douglas was given in 1746, when Dr. William Douglas, an eminent physician of Boston, in consideration of the privilege of naming the township offered the inhabitants the sum of $500.00 as a fund for the establishment of free schools together with a tract of of land with a dwelling house and barn thereon.
Douglas's forests gave rise to a woodcutting industry and the Douglas axe company.
A woolen manufacturing company, on the Mumford River in East Douglas, in recent times held by the Schuster family, has been prominent in the history of this community.
General Lafayette, of France, stopped here during the Revolutionary War, to change horses, on his way to Boston to join General Washington.
Lafayette was a hero of the American Revolution and the French Revolution.
From a very early period reaching beyond 1635, bands of Native Americans, principally the Nipmuc tribe, dominated this region of Worcester County.
The Blackstone River was once called the Nipmuc River.
Most of Douglas is part of the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor.
The underlying geology consists of rocks rich in quartz, feldspar, and mica.
Boulders are plentifully scattered all over town, and gold and silver ores are said to be found in some localities.
Large quantities of building and ornamental stone are quarried from the granite ledges found in the center of town which is shipped to almost every section of New England.
Police Chief Patrick Foley of Douglas was elected Vice President of the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), at the annual convention in Denver, Colorado, in 2009.
A common misconception in Douglas is in regard to the New England Trunkline Trail.
Many believe that railroad tracks were laid here for commuting from northern Connecticut to northern Massachusetts.
In fact, they were used to haul ice from Wallum Lake as interstate commerce.
Today you can hike these trails through Massachusetts and Connecticut.
The New England Trunkline was originally planned as a railroad, but the financier died in the sinking of the Titanic.
