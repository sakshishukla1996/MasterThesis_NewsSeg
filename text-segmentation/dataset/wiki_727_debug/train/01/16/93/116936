========,2,History.
Bands of the Nipmuc tribe were the indigenous inhabitants, and maintain a state-recognized reservation known as Hassanamessit, or Hassanamisco, which was formerly a Praying Indian village from 1647 when the Reverend John Elliot came and converted the Hassanamiscos to Christianity .
Grafton was first settled by Europeans in 1724 and was officially incorporated in 1735.
Grafton stands tall in the industrialization of the Blackstone Valley.
Its Northeast Village was once known as "New England Village".
The following is an excerpt from the "Blackstone Daily" about the history of the town:
Grafton has been a significant contributor in the success and progress of the American Industrial Revolution that was started in 1793 by Samuel Slater with his cotton mill in Pawtucket .
North Grafton's Upper Mill, now known as the Washington Mills complex, that still produces abrasives, was once known as the New England Manufacturing Company.
This was part of the New England Village, as North Grafton was known for generations.
This part of the mill was built in 1826 and was part of a much larger complex, but most of that is now gone, mainly due to serious fires.
Mill housing was built at 12, 14 and 16 Overlook Street.
These central-chimney-style homes were boarding houses with ornate trim that has since been lost.
The town is named for Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton, a title created for the illegitimate son of King Charles II of England.
Ethan Allen ran a gun factory in Grafton in the early 19th century.
In the 1930s, a movie, "Ah, Wilderness!
", was filmed in the town.
The moviemakers built a bandstand on the town common, which still stands there today.
Grafton Common has many historic homes, churches and buildings and is considered the most quintessential common in the Blackstone Valley.
The town is part of the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor, the oldest industrialized region in the U.S. North Grafton is the home of the Wyman Gordon Company.
In 1955, the United States Air Force installed a 50,000-ton metal forge in North Grafton as part of its Heavy Press Program in a plant operated by Wyman-Gordon.
It was the largest metal forge, and indeed the largest machine, in the world at the time it was built.
This forge is used to form strategic metals used in commercial and military aircraft for turbine disks, shafts, and blades, landing struts and other aircraft parts where light weight and extreme strength are needed.
The entire undercarriage of the space shuttles was forged in Grafton of magnesium.
From 1901 to 1973, North Grafton was home to the Grafton State Hospital.

The campus was made up of several clusters of buildings and eventually encompassed in Grafton, Shrewsbury, and Westborough.
The hospital was closed in 1973, and the campus, including many of the original buildings, was taken over by the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine (part of Tufts University) and the Grafton Job Corps center.
