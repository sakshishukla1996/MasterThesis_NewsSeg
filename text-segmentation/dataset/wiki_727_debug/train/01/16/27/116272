========,2,History.
The honor of naming the town is sometimes given to Alexander Shapleigh who was reportedly born around 1574 at the Manor of Kittery Court in Devon, England.
Kittery Court is located in the village of Kingsweare, across the river Dart from the city of Dartmouth.
Dartmouth, New Hampshire, of course, and Exeter and Appledore are also local place names borrowed from this region in the county of Devon.
In England the Shapleights were merchants and a major importer of salt from France.
It was a natural step to become involved in the fishing industry in which salted fish were imported from the Atlantic coast of America.
Alexander arrived in the New World in 1635 aboard his ship BENEDICTION that he co-owned with business partner Captain Francis Champernowne, a relative of Sir Walter Scott.
Like the Pepperrells of Kittery, they also set up a salt fish operation at the Isles of Shoals and exported the popular product to Europe.
ALEXANDER SHAPLEIGH(1), the pioneer of the American Branch of the Family, was born apparently at Kingsweare, Devon, England, about 1574, and was probably the son of Nicholas Shapleigh, of that place, but of this we are not quite sure.
His beautiful residence at Kingsweare was called Kittery House.
A name that had come down in the Shapleigh family for several generations, and the name, followed the family to America and finally gave name to the Town of Kittery, Maine.
From the testimony of Katherine Treworgy, we learn that Alexander Shapleigh was alive May 26, 1642.
We hear nothing more about him, and we learn from the court records that he was dead previous to July 5, 1650.
The town Kittery, Maine, was incorporated in 1647, and today bills itself as "the oldest incorporated town in Maine."
It was named after the birthplace of a founder, Alexander Shapleigh, from the manor of Kittery Court at Kingswear in Devon, England.
Shapleigh arrived in 1635 aboard the ship Benediction, which he co-owned with another prominent settler, Captain Francis Champernowne.
Together with the Pepperrell family, they established fisheries offshore at the Isles of Shoals, where fish were caught, salted and exported back to Europe.
Other pioneers were hunters, trappers and workers of the region's abundant timber.
Kittery's original land area extended from the Atlantic Ocean inland up the Salmon Falls River, including the present-day towns of Eliot, Berwick, South Berwick and North Berwick.
Kittery Court (also called Kittery Quay) still survives and is on the list of sites to visit in Kingsweare.
That also boasts a mediaeval castle.
Today a car ferry runs from Kingsware to Dartmouth and the sleepy village is a popular tourist spot.
Visitors can also take a steam railroad train along the scenic winding coast.
Originally part of the Piscataqua Plantation (renamed Kittery in 1647) called Sturgeon Creek in the 1630-40s, it became the North, or Second, Parish of Kittery in 1713 following the incorporation of Berwick.
On March 1, 1810, Eliot became a town.
Prior to its incorporation as a town, the Second Parish had been in conflict with Kittery's other parishes since at least 1791.
In 1791, the parish's minister died.
His successor, according to a large faction of the parish's inhabitants, was a man of "unfair character" imposed by "a small party" of people.
He was rejected by "a large majority", and a new minister was installed in 1792.
The internal strife between inhabitants didn't stop there.
The minority faction, angered by the removal of their minister, "petitioned the Legislature in...1796 to be set off to the third parish, which was accordingly done."
The inhabitants of the second Parish accused the members of the other two of conspiring against them.
The town was either named after Robert Eliot, who was a member of the Provincial Council of New Hampshire, or for Reverend John Eliot of Boston, a friend of General Andrew P. Fernald, the town agent largely responsible for its separation.
