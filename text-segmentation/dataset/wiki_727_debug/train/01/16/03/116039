========,1,preface.
North Haven is a town in Knox County, Maine, United States, in Penobscot Bay.
The town is both a year-round island community and a prominent summer colony.
The population was 355 at the 2010 census.
North Haven is accessed by three-times daily ferry service from Rockland, or by air taxi from Knox County Regional Airport.
========,2,History.
As early as 3300 BC, the island was visited by the Red Paint People.
Later it became part of the territory of the Penobscot Abenaki Indians, who hunted and fished in canoes along the coast.
Captain Martin Pring, the explorer from Bristol, England, "discovered" North Haven and Vinalhaven in 1603.
He called them the Fox Islands, a name which survives on the Fox Islands Thoroughfare, a mile-wide strait separating the towns which provides passage for boats crossing Penobscot Bay.
Settled in the 1760s, North Haven was originally the North Island of Vinalhaven, from which it was set off and incorporated on June 30, 1846 as Fox Isle.
It was changed to North Haven on July 13, 1847.
An act was passed by the state legislature in 1850 which gave the majority of island inhabitants "the right to have such roads as they deemed fit."
The majority thereupon decided to have no roads at all, or else roads obstructed with gates or bars at the discretion of landowners.
Not surprisingly, the minority of inhabitants petitioned to amend the act.
Fishing and farming became chief occupations.
The surface of the town is even, and farmers produced hay as a staple crop.
Boatbuilding became an important industry, and even now the community has two boatyards.
But many inhabitants were fishermen who caught lobsters, scallops and oysters.
In the 1880s, the island was discovered by "rusticators," seasonal residents first from Boston, then followed a decade or two later by others from New York and Philadelphia.
North Haven is best known today for its sizable summer colony of prominent Northeasterners, particularly Boston Brahmins, drawn to the island for over a century to savor its simple way of life.
The southern side of the Fox Islands Thoroughfare is often informally considered part of North Haven, since Vinalhaven's north shore is nearly a dozen miles from that community's town center.
In contrast to Vinalhaven, North Haven's economy relies less on the lobster industry and more on sustaining its summer resort community.
Energy for the community is partially provided by the wind project in Vinalhaven through the Fox Island Electric Cooperative.
Although the island is a popular destination, it actually provides few tourist amenities—two inns, a grocery store, two seasonal restaurants, a pizza shop, and two gift shops—and is instead geared toward those with vacation homes on the island.
A small population of Mouflon sheep (native to Europe and western Asia) escaped from an animal enclosure owned by Thomas Watson, Jr. on the island in the 1990s and still survive there.
========,2,North Haven Dinghy.
In 1885, William Weld challenged the yachtsmen of North Haven to a race.
He used the tender from his yacht "Gitana" and unsuccessfully raced against a variety of sprit-sailed boats.
That winter he went home and had a better dinghy designed and built in Salem, Massachusetts.
The next year he beat all contenders.
The boat was hauled out at North Haven, and two copies were made by Henry Calderwood.
The subsequent race was between Mrs. Cobb, Miss Spencer and Miss Hayward.
The first boats had sprit rigs, but this soon gave way to gaff rigs.
In 1888, James Osman Brown built four more dinghies.
This was at the beginning of J. O.
Brown & Sons boatyard.
The racing fleet grew over the years.
They are still raced out of North Haven, making them the oldest continuously raced class in the United States.

========,2,Education.
North Haven is unusual among Maine island communities for offering a K–12 school whereas most islands only have elementary schools and tuition their high school students to high schools on the mainland (Vinalhaven, Mount Desert Island, and Islesboro are the only other islands to offer K–12 education).
North Haven Community School is one of the smallest public schools in Maine.
The school’s motto is “Competence, Compassion, Challenge and Community.” Notable alumni include Hannah Pingree, who served as Maine’s Speaker of the House of Representatives for two terms.
