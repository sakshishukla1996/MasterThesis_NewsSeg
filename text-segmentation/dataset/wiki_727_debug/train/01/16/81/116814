========,1,preface.
Easthampton is a city in Hampshire County, Massachusetts, United States.
The city is on the southeastern edge of the Pioneer Valley near the five colleges in the college towns of Northampton and Amherst.
The population was 16,053 at the 2010 census.
========,2,History.
Easthampton was first settled by European immigrants beginning in 1664 and was originally part of Northampton.
In 1785, the village of Easthampton was formally named its own separate political entity, and in 1809, it officially became a town.
Easthampton is the youngest town in Hampshire County by date of incorporation.
(It was not, however, the last incorporated; two of the three disincorporated towns of the Quabbin Reservoir in Hampshire County, Enfield and Prescott, were incorporated afterwards.)
The town grew primarily around the Manhan River, both through its phase as a strictly agricultural community and later, through the industrial revolution, when mills and factories were first built in Easthampton, mainly in connection with textile manufacturing and its offshoots.
The first of these, the Williston-Knight Button Company, was established in 1847 by Samuel Williston, son of the town’s first minister, a Congregationalist named Payson Williston.
The company specialized in cloth-covered buttons – a coveted item at the time – and to facilitate the operation of the machinery, a local brook was dammed, creating Nashawannuck Pond.
Other mills soon opened nearby, a number of them specializing in elastic and rubber thread manufacturing.
Following this spurt of industrial development, the town’s first high school and first national bank opened in 1864, and a town hall was built in 1869.
Constables were replaced by the town’s first police officer in 1871, the same year that Easthampton became a regular stop on the railroad.
The town’s public library opened in 1881, and fourteen years later in 1895, the community was introduced to two new innovations, telephones and streetcars.
With the influx of new residents came a number of new churches, founded for Catholic, Episcopalian, Lutheran, and Methodist parishioners, as well as a second Congregational church.
In 1899, the West Boylston Manufacturing Company and the Hampton Company, both specializing in cloth production, moved to Easthampton, recruiting a larger immigrant labor force, particularly from Poland and Canada.
During World War I, the town’s mills all obtained federal wartime contracts and did well financially, but long before the Great Depression hit, many factories owners were already laying off employees, seeking mergers with other companies, or looking for buyers for their facilities.
World War II provided some relief for the Easthampton economy, as several of the older textile companies as well as newer heavy manufacturing corporations received another round of federal contracts.
However, beginning in the early 1960s a number of critical closures hit the town hard.
Revitalization attempts began with the opening of a new industrial park and continued with joint government-private industrial mall which has failed to solve significantly higher rates of unemployment and poverty compared to Hampshire County.
Small farms and well-established small businesses remain the economic core of Easthampton.
Easthampton changed its charter in 1996 to become a city.
The downtown area since 1996 has attracted a small community of artists and young people migrating due to Easthampton's lower cost of living compared to nearby Northampton, a hub of the bohemian community regionally.
Small stores around Main Street, Union Street, and Cottage Street have changed business due to the influx of this new demographic.
This growth has produced new arts and cultural events such as the monthly Art Walk Easthampton, held each "Second Saturday," in which visual, music and performance artists showcase their talents at venues around the city.
========,2,Geography.
Easthampton is bordered by Southampton and Westhampton to its west, by Holyoke to its east and south, and by Northampton to its north.
It also has a river boundary with Hadley to its northeast along the Connecticut River.
The western flanks of Mount Tom and Mount Nonotuck form its eastern boundary.
Easthampton has numerous small streams.
========,2,Education.
In 1797, the town was divided into four school districts.
By the middle of the 19th century, the town offered over 12 small schools.
Over the following century, the town began to reduce the amount of small schools and began to build schools suited for higher volume.
In 1897, an eight-room school was constructed on Maple Street.
The Maple Street School was later enlarged to 16 rooms.
The junior high school was consolidated here from 1950-1962.
After 1962, this school was used for elementary classes.
Mount Holyoke College graduate Sarah Chapin, the last principal of girls at Williston Seminary, became the town's first high school principal in 1864.
Chapin designed the initial curriculum, and served as principal until ill health in 1891.
She retired with the class of 1901 and died that summer.
In 1864, Williston Seminary decided to stop offering classes for girls.
The town constructed a two-story school for use as the town's first high school.
In 1912, the school district constructed a new high school and enlarged this building (then called Park Primary School) using brick salvaged from the Center Union School.
It was used as an elementary school until 1939 and again in the 1950s into the 1970s.
This building, now called the Memorial Building, is currently being used as municipal offices.
In 1902, the town responded to the population increase resulting from the growth of the West Boylston and Hampton Companies.
The Center Street School, an eight-room school, replaced the Center Union School.
In 1920, the interior of this building was reconfigured as a 12-room school.
It has served as a middle school, high school, and grade school.
Replacing the Lovefield Street School in 1902, the Parsons Street School was built to serve children in the New City section of town.
In 1912, a new high school was built.
An eight-room school was expanded in 1934, adding a gymnasium and an auditorium.
After a new high school was built in 1962, this building was used for a junior high school and middle school.
in 1975, it was converted for use as a grade school.
Now known as the Neil A. Pepin School, it is still a grammar school.
Currently, the town has three elementary schools (Neil A. Pepin School, Center Street School, and Maple Street School), a middle school (White Brook Middle School), and a high school (Easthampton High School), which was built in 2013.
It has a private Roman Catholic school, Notre Dame-Immaculate Conception School.

Easthampton has a number of points of interest.
The Mount Tom State Reservation extends into parts of the city, and many local residents hike up to enjoy the view of the Pioneer Valley from the rock ledges.
Mount Tom, 1202 feet (363 m), is the highest traprock peak on the Metacomet Ridge, a linear mountain range that extends from Long Island Sound to the Vermont border.
