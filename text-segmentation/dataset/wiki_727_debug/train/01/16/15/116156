========,2,History.
In 1808 James Grover was the first white settler in what is now Medford.
In 1820, the state opened a road from the Piscataquis River, which helped increase settlement.
In 1820, John Parker Boyd, owner of the eastern half of the town, erected a combination sawmill and shingle mill on the Piscataquis River.
In 1824 the town incorporated as Kilmarnock, the name chosen by Boyd.
An 1825 fire destroyed over three-quarters of the buildings in town, as well as the large stand of pine trees used to supply the sawmill and shingle mill.
The mill was saved, but later closed because the burning of the nearby trees had deprived the business of a steady supply of wood.
The inhabitants of Kilmarnock petitioned to change the town's name to Medford in 1856.
The town surrendered its charter in 1940, and was organized as a plantation in 1942.
In 1967 Medford was again organized as a town.
