========,2,History.
Hamilton, Missouri owes its existence largely to the Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad.
Prior to 1854 the area around Hamilton was unsettled prairie land belonging to the U.S. Government.
With the coming of the railroad, the Hamilton Town Company was formed to develop a tract of land along the rails.
At first the name Prairie City was intended for the new community.
However, Albert Gallatin Davis, a key member of the Town Company, chose Hamilton instead, in honor of two early Americans, Founding Father and first Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, and Joseph Hamilton, an early American lawyer and military leader killed at the Battle of the Thames during the War of 1812.
The first house in Hamilton, fittingly, was built by Davis in the summer of 1855, as well as the first business, a general store, in 1857.
The store would serve as Hamilton's first post office and Davis as the first postmaster in 1858.
The Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad was finally completed on February 14, 1859, and the first train arrived that day.
A railroad depot was constructed by the fall of 1859, with Albert Gallatin Davis appointed the first railroad and express agent.
By the outbreak of the American Civil War, Hamilton consisted of about 25 homes and businesses.
The town saw little involvement in the war, despite northwest and north-central Missouri being a hotbed of guerrilla warfare.
The majority of the towns residents held strong pro-Union sympathies, with the few pro-Confederates among the populace forced to take an oath of allegiance.
Being on the rail line made Hamilton a tempting target for Confederate "bushwhackers", so beginning in the fall of 1861, a company of the 50th Illinois Infantry arrived to help the local Home Guard unit defend the town.
Once the war ended Hamilton experienced a period of rapid growth, and was incorporated in 1868.
At that time several new sections of land had been annexed into the original town plat and the population grew to several hundred.
After a brief slowdown caused by the Panic of 1873, growth resumed.
By the mid-1880s, Hamilton had two newspapers, the "Hamiltonian" and the "News-Graphic", as well as two banks, two hotels, flour mills, grain elevators, and other businesses supported by a population of around 1,800.
Coal mining became of some importance to the town's economy in the early 1880s.
The Hamilton Coal Company was organized in the spring of 1882 and began mining operations the following year about two miles outside of the town.
A railroad spur line was constructed to connect the coal field to the Hannibal & St. Joseph main line.
========,3,Town of champions.
Penney High School, Hamilton, named in honor of the town's most famous native, has won several Missouri state sports championships.
The boys won the football championship four times, and placed at the state level in basketball, track and field, and golf.

========,3,Quilting.
Missouri Star Quilt Company has made Hamilton a national tourist destination for quilters.
It was founded by the Doan siblings in support of their mother Jenny Doan's dream, and in tribute to her talent as a quilter made famous on YouTube.
It has grown into a $20,000,000 per year business which owns 21 buildings in Hamilton and is part owner of three restaurants.
It's two warehouses occupy over 8 acres of floor space in the south of Hamilton, and ship out materials by semi-trailer each week.
MSQC also publishes a bi-monthly magazine called "BLOCK".
The business brings as many as 3,000 quilters to Hamilton in a month, and has helped transform the small town into a veritable quilter's paradise, with 12 new quilt shops and a sewing center for quilting retreats.
In seven years, Missouri Star became the largest employer in Caldwell County, with over 300 employees.
Because of this, the siblings who put their mother on the map with the help of business expertise were in 2015 named the Missouri Small Business Persons of the Year, and were named by the federal government's Small Business Association as the national Small Business Persons of the Year.
