========,2,Controversy.
On April 3, 2010, school officials canceled the local prom in response to a court order requiring them to let a local student attend with her same-sex date.
Allegations were made against the school of being biased and "unfair".
In response to the canceled prom, local citizens decided to hold two private proms outside the school system's jurisdiction—one that was announced publicly, and one secret private prom .
The girl and her same-sex date were directed to attend the publicly announced event, attended by only a handful of students, instead of the secret private prom that most students attended.
