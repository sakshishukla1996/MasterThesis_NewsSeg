========,2,History.
Sebastopol was originally called "Hathaway Springs".
The town was in existence before the Civil War but not incorporated until 1917.
According to oral tradition, "a Swede" traveling through the area named the town for Sevastopol, Crimea.
It is rumored that the "Swede" was Frederick Law Olmsted (Central Park Fame) who stayed at Sebastopol House in Seguin, Texas during his travels throughout the southern US.
From 1852 to 1857 Olmsted was sent south by his employer, "The New York Times", to study and write about slavery in the South (Journeys and Explorations in the Cotton Kingdom).
Sebastopol has a few local businesses that keep the town thriving.
The town's main convenience store, "Duett's", has been owned and operated by the Duett family for years.
The town also has "Brent's" gas station, which is closed on Sundays and stays open half a day on Wednesdays.
The station is commonly referred to as "Brent's Texaco" even though Texaco plays no part in the store's operation anymore.
The town has one grocery store which was once called "Hamill's."
The store was bought out by Piggly Wiggly.
Also a large contribution to Sebastopol is "Easom's Hardware", operated by the Easom family for many years, who also own Maxim Manufacturing on Hwy 21.
The town has one pharmacy that has been in operation as Moore's Pharmacy since 1990.
Many new businesses have been opened as of late, such as a "Dollar General", "Bethel Framing", "Tangle's, "ADD Trucking" and "Adele McDill Photography".
Each fall season Sebastopol has Sebastopolooza–a fairly large fall festival.
In 2010 Sebastopolooza had over a thousand people.
Sebastopol is centrally located between four larger towns, the towns of Forest, Carthage, Union and Philadelphia.
Even though the town has a local grocery store, most people are forced to drive to one of the larger towns to purchase basic household goods.
The nearest theatre is a small local operation located in Philadelphia, Mississippi.
People wanting to shop at a mall or watch a movie in a large cinema have to travel to Meridian or Jackson which is about an hour's drive each way.
The town received cable TV in the late 1990s which has yet to be offered to areas located just outside the city limits.
Most local people wishing to have television are forced to subscribe to satellite programming.
This makes accessibility to high speed internet almost impossible.
On October 11, 2010 all cable services from sky cablevision, the only cable provider for Sebastopol, were disconnected.
