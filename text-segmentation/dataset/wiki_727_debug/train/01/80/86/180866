========,1,preface.
The 1999 Cricket World Cup (officially known as ICC Cricket World Cup 99) was the seventh edition of the Cricket World Cup, organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC).
It was hosted primarily by England, with some games being played in Scotland, Ireland, Wales and the Netherlands.
The tournament was won by Australia, who beat Pakistan by 8 wickets in the final at Lord's Cricket Ground in London.
New Zealand and South Africa were the other semi-finalists.
The tournament featured 12 teams, playing a total of 42 matches.
In the group stage, the teams were divided into two groups of six; each team played all the others in their group once.
The top three teams from each group advanced to the Super Sixes, a new concept for the 1999 World Cup; each team carried forward the points from the games against the other qualifiers from their group and then played each of the qualifiers from the other group (in other words, each qualifier from Group A played each qualifier from Group B).
The top four teams in the Super Sixes advanced to the semi-finals.

Scotland played two of their Group B matches in their home country becoming the first associate nation to host games in a World Cup.
One Group B match was played in Wales and Ireland, while one Group A match was played in the Netherlands.
========,2,Super Six.
This stage was among the most viewed segments of the tournament, as India and Pakistan were officially at war during their cricket match, the only time this has ever happened in the history of the sport.
Points Carried Forward (PCF) only applied to the six teams that progressed from the group stage of the tournament, those points were the number of points scored against their fellow qualifiers from their respective groups.
Points carried forward did not change once in the Super Sixes.

Rahul Dravid of India scored most runs (461) in the tournament.

========,2,Controversies.
A controversial new type of cricket ball, the white ‘Duke’, was introduced for the first time in the 1999 World Cup.
Despite claims from makers British Cricket Balls Ltd that the balls behaved identically to the balls used in previous World Cups, they were proven to be harder and to swing significantly more.
========,2,Media.
The host broadcasters for television coverage of the tournament were Sky and BBC Television.
In the UK, live games were divided between the broadcasters, with both screening the final live.
This was BBC Television's last live cricket coverage, with England home Test series being on Channel 4 or Sky from 1999 onwards.
