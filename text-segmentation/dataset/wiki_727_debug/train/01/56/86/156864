========,1,preface.
Göttingen () is a district (German: "Landkreis") in Lower Saxony, Germany.
It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the district of Northeim, and by the states of Thuringia (district of Eichsfeld) and Hesse (districts of Werra-Meißner and Kassel).
========,2,History.
In 1885 the Prussian government established the districts of Göttingen, Münden and Duderstadt within the Province of Hanover.
These districts existed for 88 years, before they were merged in 1973 to form the present district of Göttingen.
On 1 November 2016, it was reformed by the addition of the former district of Osterode.

The western half of the district is occupied by the Weserbergland mountains.
The Weser River receives it name near the town of Hannoversch Münden, where the Fulda joins the Werra.
Further east the Leine river runs through the district from south to north.
