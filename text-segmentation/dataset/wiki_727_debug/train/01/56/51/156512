These Lasker Awards are popularly known as America's Nobels.
Over the 2013/2014 academic year, members of staff took part in numerous strikes after staff were offered a pay rise of 1% which unions equated to a 13% pay cut since 2008.

Liverpool was the first among UK universities to develop their desktop computer power management solution, which has been widely adopted by other institutions.
The university has subsequently piloted other advanced software approaches further increasing savings.
The university has also been at the forefront of using the Condor HTC computing platform in a power saving environment.
This software, which makes use of unused computer time for computationally intensive tasks usually results in computers being left turned on.
The university has demonstrated an effective solution for this problem using a mixture of Wake-on-LAN and commercial power management software.
