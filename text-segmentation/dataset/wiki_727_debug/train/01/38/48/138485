========,2,History.
The first stories of temporary European settlement in the Rivesville area involve a Boston native, Pompey Leggett, who settled briefly in the area in 1694, but the first permanent settlements along the Monongahela were not established until after the French and Indian War in 1763.
Frontier forts and frequent clashes between Europeans and Native Americans continued for several decades.
Rivesville was platted in 1837, and named after William Cabell Rives.
In 1900, it was a very small town, population 164, growing to 190 in 1910.
This was immediately before the development of large-scale coal mining in the area and the subsequent population growth.
In the early 20th century, Rivesville was at the junction between the Pawpaw branch of the B&O Railroad and the Buckhannon & Northern Railroad, a branch of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie a predecessor that was incorporated into the Monongahela Railway formed in 1915.
Rivesville was also served by the Fairmont-Clarksburg Division of the Monongahela-West Pen Railways, originally the Monongahela Power and Railway Company.
This electric interurban line ran from Fairmont through Rivesville to the Rivesville Power Station, just north of town.

========,3,Power plant.
The Rivesville Power Plant was built by Monongahela Power and Railway Company in 1919 and is currently operated by Allegheny Energy.
Unit 5, installed in 1944 had a power output of 48 megawatts; Unit 6, installed in 1951, was 94 megawatts.
The plant used open loop cooling, drawing up to 69.8 million gallons per day of cooling water from the Monongahela River.
The coal stockpile at the plant had a capacity of 50,000 tons, and coal was delivered by barge.
Earlier, coal was delivered by rail.
The plant was connected to the grid by 138Kv transmission lines.
In the mid 1970s, this was the first commercial power plant to use fluidized bed combustion to fire its boilers.
, this power plant employed 33 people.
New environmental regulations forced the company to shut down the plant in 2012, along with two others elsewhere in the state.
========,3,Coal mining.
About the only area around Rivesville where the coal has not been mined out is directly under the older portion of the town and under the riverbed.
Consolidation Coal Company Mine No.
97 was in the Pittsburgh coal seam around 100 feet below the level of the riverbed.
This mine operated between 1922 and 1954, with a peak production of 670408 tons per year.
The coal seam itself is 6 to 8 feet thick.
The number 97 Hoist Shaft was directly west of the westernmost corner of the Power Plant, with the hoisting engines to the north across the tracks.
Mine No.
24 was directly across the river, with its shaft in the company town of Montana Mines, and in 1943, plans were filed to connect these mines with an under-river crossing.
In 1934, Consol.
97 employed 412 men, all of whom were UMWA members.
The daily wage ranged from $6.37 for loaders to $9.29 for cutters.
Other mines in the area exploited the shallower Sewickley Coal Seam, largely above the river level to the north and east.
Between 1901 and 1913, for example, the Parker Run Coal and Coke Company operated a mine just east of Rivesville, shipping coal by rail and barge.
In 1910, this mine employed 60 miners.
In 1913, it employed 10 laborers and 25 miners to take 500 tons of coal a day.
The coal in this seam was over 6 feet thick, but higher in sulfur than the Pittsburgh seam.
Mines in the Sewickley seam were opened earlier and mined out earlier than the mines in the Pittsburgh Seam.
In 1913, the Monongahela Valley Traction Company had a mine in the even shallower Waynesburg coal seam about a mile southwest of Rivesville near Dakota.
This coal seam was about 5 feet thick, including an intermediate shale bed one foot thick.
By 1921, Monongahela Traction had opened a second mine in the area near Baxter, about a mile up Paw Paw creek.
As of 1921, other mines listed as being in Rivesville included the Rivesville Coal Company's Hood Mine, the Winfield Coal Company's River Side Mine, and the Virginia & Pittsburgh Coal & Coke Co.'s Morgan mine.
