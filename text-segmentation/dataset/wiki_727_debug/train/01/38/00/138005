Kent's population as of April, 2010 was 92,411 according to the 2010 census.
The total grew to an estimated 126,952 as of July 1, 2015, owing primarily to annexation.

========,2,History.
The Kent area was first permanently settled by westerners in the early 1860s along the banks of (what was then) the White River, and originally called Titusville.
(There is still a 'Titusville Station' sign on Gowe Street near First Avenue.)
During the 1880s the town discovered hops production as the major source of income.
Due to an aphid invasion which affected hops crops in Europe, hops from the Puget Sound area were commanding high prices.
Hops were shipped from Titusville either by the river or via rail.
In 1889 the town was renamed for the County of Kent, the major hops producing region in England.
Hops production in the White River valley came to an end soon after its own invasion of aphids in 1891.
Kent was officially incorporated on May 28, 1890 with a population of 793, the second city incorporated in King County.
Seattle was the first.
After the turn of the 20th century the area turned to dairy farming, and was home to a Carnation Condensed Milk plant.
Flooding from both the Green and the White Rivers was a constant problem.
In 1906, flooding changed the course of the White River, which reduced the flood hazard by half.
The Green River continued to present problems until the creation of the Howard A. Hanson Dam at Eagle Gorge in 1962.
During and after the Great Depression, Kent was known as the "Lettuce Capital of the World."
After WWII, Kent began to grow more rapidly.
From 1953 to 1960 the city's size grew twelve-fold.
In 1965 Boeing began building in Kent, followed a few years later by other aerospace and high-tech companies.
