========,2,History.
Leigh S. J.
Hunt, a resident of nearby Yarrow Point, acquired the property of Hunts Point some time after 1870.
He wanted it so that he could cut down the tall evergreen trees that grew out at the end, obstructing his view of Lake Washington.
Around 1900, the property was taken over by Puget Sound National Bank and sold to a group of Seattle men who used it as a family retreat for Sunday picnics and summer camping.
Before the creation of the two Lake Washington bridges, residents commuted to Seattle via the Gazelle, a small ferry that arrived at Cozy Cove each morning at 7:15.
A clubhouse was built in 1913 at what is now 3655 Hunts Point Road.
It became the center of Hunts Point's social activity through the 1920s.
That same year, the women of Hunts Point formed the charitable organization The Eastside Circle of the Seattle Fruit and Flower Mission (later called The Overlake Service League), which continues to this day.
In the 1950s, Stan Sayres, owner of the famous Slo Mo unlimited hydroplane, housed the boat at the end of Hunts Point Road.
Hunts Point was officially incorporated on August 22, 1955.
