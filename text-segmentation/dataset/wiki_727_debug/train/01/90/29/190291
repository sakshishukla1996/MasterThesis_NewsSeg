========,1,preface.
USS "Kearsarge" (BB-5), the lead ship of her class of pre-dreadnought battleships, was a United States Navy ship, named after the sloop-of-war .
Her keel was laid down by the Newport News Shipbuilding Company of Virginia, on 30 June 1896.
She was launched on 24 March 1898, sponsored by the wife of Rear Admiral Herbert Winslow, and commissioned on 20 February 1900.
Between 1903 and 1907 "Kearsarge" served in the North Atlantic Fleet, and from 1907 to 1909 she sailed as part of the Great White Fleet.
In 1909 she was decommissioned for modernization, which was finished in 1911.
In 1915 she served in the Atlantic, and between 1916 and 1919 she served as a training ship.
She was converted into a crane ship in 1920, renamed "Crane Ship No.
1" in 1941, and sold for scrap in 1955.
She was the only United States Navy battleship to not be named after a state.
========,2,Design.
The "Kearsarge"-class battleships were designed to be used for coastal defense.
They had a displacement of , an overall length of , a beam of and a draft of .
The two 3-cylinder vertical triple-expansion steam engines and five Scotch boilers, connected to two propeller shafts, produced a total of , and gave a maximum speed of .
"Kearsarge" was manned by 40 officers and 514 enlisted men, a total of 554 crew.
"Kearsarge" had two double turrets, with two /35 caliber guns and two /40 caliber guns each, stacked in two levels.
The guns and turret armor were designed by the Bureau of Ordnance, while the turret itself was designed by the Bureau of Construction and Repair.
This caused the guns to be mounted far back in the turret, making the ports very large.
Admiral William Sims claimed that as a result, a shell fired into the port could reach the magazines below, disabling the guns.
In addition to these guns, "Kearsarge" carried fourteen /40 caliber guns, twenty 6-pounder () guns, eight 1-pounder () guns, four machine guns, and four 18 inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes.
"Kearsarge" had a very low freeboard, which resulted in her guns becoming unusable in bad weather.
The ship's waterline armor belt was thick and the main gun turrets were protected by of armor, while the secondary turrets had of armor.
The barbettes were thick, while the conning tower had of armor.
The armor was made of harveyized steel.
"Kearsarge" carried 16 smaller boats.
A steam cutter, with a capacity of 60 men, together with a steam cutter, were used for general carrying from and to port, and could tow the other boats if needed.
Two 33-foot launches, each capable of carrying 64 men, were the "working boats".
There were ten boats: four cutters, each with a capacity of 45 men, the Admiral's barge, two whaleboats (which served as lifeboats), and the Captain's gig.
Four smaller boats completed "Kearsarge"s small fleet: two dinghies and two catamarans.
========,2,Construction.
"Kearsarge" was authorized on 2 March 1895, the contract for her construction was awarded on 2 January 1896, and the keel of the vessel was laid down on 30 June 1896 by Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company in Virginia.
The total cost was US$5,043,591.68.
She was named soon after the American Civil War sloop-of-war sank, and was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named, by act of Congress, in its honor.
She was the only US battleship not named after a state.
She was christened on 24 March 1898 (the same day as her sister ship, "Kentucky") by the wife of Captain Herbert Winslow, daughter-in-law of Captain John Ancrum Winslow, the commander of the original "Kearsarge".
She was commissioned on 20 February 1900, under the command of Captain William M. Folger.
