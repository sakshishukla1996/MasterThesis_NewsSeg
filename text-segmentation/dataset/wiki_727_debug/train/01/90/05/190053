(, also known as Jackie Chan's Who Am I?)
is a 1998 Hong Kong action comedy film directed by Benny Chan and Jackie Chan, who also starred in the lead role.
The film was released in Hong Kong on January 17, 1998.
========,2,Plot.
Somewhere in the jungles of South Africa, a multinational military unit, Special Force Unit, ambushes a convoy and kidnaps several scientists working on a highly-volatile compound extracted from a recently discovered meteorite.
Among the operatives is a Hong Kong national identified as "Jackie Chan".
The CIA assigns Morgan to investigate the incident, unaware that he and newly retired General Sherman orchestrated the abduction for their personal profit.
At the same time, the CIA assigns another operative in South Africa for a more covert operation.
Jackie wakes up in a tribal village somewhere in the African veldt, still recovering from injuries sustained in an accident he cannot remember; as a result, when asked for his name by the natives, he responds by asking himself, "Who Am I?
", and is referred to as that by the natives.
The tribesmen show him the remains of a crashed helicopter and graves of those who perished aboard.
He spends weeks recuperating from his wounds and learning about the tribe's culture.
After spotting rally cars from several miles away, "Who Am I?"
bids the village farewell and ventures on a journey back to civilization.
He befriends Japanese rally navigator Yuki after saving her brother from a snake bite and offering to help them finish the race.
When they reach Johannesburg, "Who Am I?"
meets Christine Stark, a journalist sent to interview him about his rally adventure.
However, Morgan hears of "Who Am I?"
and sends a hitman team to kill him.
Morgan also pretends to be his ally, telling him to contact him if he is in danger.
After escaping from the hitmen, Christine cracks a secret code written on a matchbook found on one of the dead operatives, which leads them to Rotterdam, Netherlands.
"Who Am I?"
and Christine bid Yuki farewell and head for Rotterdam to find more answers to his identity.
In Rotterdam, "Who Am I?"
discovers that Christine is actually an undercover CIA agent who tapped his calls.
Not knowing whom to trust, he battles Sherman's hitmen and sneaks into the Willemswerf alone, where he discovers the masterminds behind the kidnapping of the scientists.
It is revealed that Morgan and General Sherman are about to sell the extraterrestrial compound to a powerful arms dealer named Armano.
While waiting for the online transaction to finish, the three men leave the conference room for a coffee break - giving "Who Am I?"
time to sneak in and steal the disc containing the compound information.
He also cancels the transaction and sends the money to a children's organization "Save The Children's Fund, which infuriates the arms dealer.
Once he discovers Morgan's betrayal, "Who Am I?"
tries to kill Morgan, but interrupted by Morgan's hitmen.
After escaping from the building from a battle with Morgan's hitmen, "Who Am I?"
regroups with Christine, who calls for the execution of a "Plan B", to surround the Erasmus Bridge and corner Morgan.
Once Christine kicks Morgan and takes him into custody, "Who Am I?"
throws the disc off the bridge and tells Christine he will return to Africa.
========,2,Production notes.
"Who Am I?"
was shot on locations in Namibia, South Africa, and Netherlands between February and March 1997.
The film features several landmarks such as Sun City in South Africa, Erasmus Bridge in Rotterdam, the Beurstraverse (which was portrayed by the film makers as being in Johannesburg), the Cube houses and the Willemswerf building (which served as the headquarters of the villains and from the side of which, "Who Am I?"
escaped by sliding to the ground).
The film also features an elaborate chase scene involving the then popular Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IV and a pack of chasing BMW 3-series, in which Jackie, Yuki, and Christine (in the Evolution) attempt to escape from their captors.
Several memorable stunts in the Evolution IV were featured, including a spin parking manoeuvre, market chase, and flipping the car onto its side and roof.
In the making-of documentary, the team outlined the numerous Lancer Evolutions that were needed for the entire sequence due to the harsh physical challenges presented by the stunts.
The use of the Evolution IV was consistent with the ongoing presence and sponsorship of Mitsubishi in Jackie Chan's films of that era.

There are English subtitles provided for the whole film.
