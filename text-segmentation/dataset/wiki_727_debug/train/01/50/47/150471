========,2,History.
One-time lawman and pioneer land developer C.C.
Duson is credited with founding Eunice, which was named for his second wife, Eunice Pharr Duson.
He and his brother, W.W. Duson, had already founded Crowley, Louisiana in 1887, and now he looked to the north of the parish for future development.
Duson bought of land from Willie Humble of Prairie Faquetaïque and mapped out a town site, laid out in lots 50-by-140 feet, 12 lots to the block.
Next, he persuaded the Southern Pacific Railroad to extend a branch line from Crowley to his new town.
Then he began what he and his brother had learned how to do as well as anyone: promote land sales.
It was chartered as a village on September 12, 1894, and incorporated as a town on June 4, 1895.
Evangeline Parish was created with the passage of a bill in June 1908.
