On the original site of an Attakapas Indian village, Arnaudville is one of the oldest remaining towns in St. Landry Parish.
First called "La Murière", it was later known as "La Jonction" which meant "The Junction" translated from French.
By the 19th century, the town was named after the Brothers Arnaud, who had donated a large amount of land to the town to make a Church for whites and blacks (which still exists today).
The Arnauds were the family in which the town got its final name from, many of whose descendants still live in the area.
But the French had settled the town in the late 18th century.
Arnaudville was incorporated in 1870.
