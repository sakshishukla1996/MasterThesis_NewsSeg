One Foot in the Grave is the third independent studio album and fourth overall by American alternative rock musician Beck, released in June 1994 on K Records, an independent label.
Like "Stereopathetic Soulmanure", the album never charted; however, "One Foot in the Grave" strengthened Beck's critical reputation, arguably allowing him to break into the mainstream with "Odelay" in 1996.
"One Foot in the Grave" shows a strong folk influence that is more pronounced than on his more eclectic-style albums of the time, "Mellow Gold" and "Odelay".
"One Foot in the Grave" was recorded prior to the release of his third album "Mellow Gold", but was not released until after that album met with critical and commercial success.
The album features the production talents, songwriting talents, and occasional backing vocals of Calvin Johnson, founder of K Records.
It was recorded at Dub Narcotic Studio, which was then housed in Calvin's basement.
Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers would cover the track "Asshole" on the 1996 soundtrack album "Songs and Music from "She's the One"".
Beck's cover of "He's a Mighty Good Leader" was featured in the 2003 film "Holes".
As of July 2008, "One Foot in the Grave" had sold 168,000 copies in the United States.
On April 14, 2009, the album was reissued with 13 unreleased tracks by Beck's own Iliad label.
