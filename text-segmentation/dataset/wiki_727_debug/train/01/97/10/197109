========,1,preface.
Asia is the self-titled debut studio album by English rock band Asia, released in 1982.
According to both "Billboard" and Cash Box, it was the #1 album in the United States for the year 1982.
It contains their biggest hit "Heat of the Moment", which reached #4 in the US on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart.
========,2,Critical reception.
Since its release, "Asia" has received highly mixed reception, largely due to a more commercial and pop-oriented sound as opposed to progressive rock, given the past of the group's members.
Robert Christgau blasted the album, and particularly its lyrics.
He stated that it had been a rare occasion that "a big new group is bad enough to sink your teeth into any more" and called the album "pompous â€“ schlock in the grand manner".
On the other side, in a "Billboard" review, it was favourably noted that "the caliber of the [band's] playing is superb and the music sounds fresh and perfect fare for AOR".
In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Tom Demalon awarded "Asia" four-and-a-half out of five, saying that "there's no denying the epic grandeur of the music, which provided some much-needed muscle to radio at the time, and did so with style".
========,2,Commercial performance.
Upon its release in March 1982, "Asia" reached #1 in the US and spent nine weeks at the top of the "Billboard" album chart.
"Asia" was certified 4x-platinum in the US by the RIAA on 10 February 1995.
In the band's native UK, "Asia" did not perform as well as in the US, peaking only at #11 and spent a total of 38 weeks in the UK Albums Chart.
The record received a gold status in Britain on 18 October 1982.
"Heat of the Moment" climbed to No.
"Asia"'s total worldwide sales are estimated at over ten million copies.
