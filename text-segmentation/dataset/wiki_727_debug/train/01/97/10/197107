========,1,preface.
1977 is the first official album by Ash, released in May 1996 in the United Kingdom and the following month in the US.
The punk rock influenced album proved popular in the UK and Ireland, and to a lesser degree elsewhere, where Britpop was a smaller cult phenomenon.
It is ranked at 417 on the "NME" poll of the 500 greatest albums of all time.
========,2,Recording.
In 2008 Tim Wheeler remembered:We'd literally left school six months before...
It was insane, just a totally mental time.
It was the first time we had a residential time in a studio, and they had all the meals for you and you could just stay up.
We just got very nocturnal and very crazy.
[Producer] Owen Morris had been not so gradually introducing us to drugs, so we were off our heads a lot of the time!
One of the dumbest thing we did was we recorded this track called The Scream.
We spent three days working on it.
We built up 48 tracks that started out like a murmur up to full on screaming.
I was on acid one time dancing to it.
By the time we got to the end of it we were too scared to mix it.
Sick Party was originally one of the tracks we were adding to this melange of noise, but we kept listening to it and it turned out to be so funny we ended up using it on its own.
========,2,Title meaning.
The title refers to a year of three events that shaped the band: the births of two of the band-members; the year the first punk albums were released (especially "Damned Damned Damned" and "Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols"); and the release of "Star Wars".
The album opens with the sound of a TIE fighter, and ends with the track "Darkside Lightside", the title of which is a "Star Wars" reference, and which climaxes with a choral version of the "Star Wars" theme.
The band also covered "Cantina Band", as the b-side to the "Girl From Mars" single.
========,2,Reception.
"Originally it was the fast, poppy songs that made me go up and down a lot," remarked Neil Hannon, frontman of The Divine Comedy.
"But then suddenly you have the most beautiful chord changes and tunes that you never thought would happen like 'Goldfinger' and 'Oh Yeah'.
It's also nice to have your chums from home being big in the pop world."
========,2,Accolades.
Several UK music magazines placed the album in their end-of-year lists for 1996, including "Vox", "NME", "Melody Maker", "Q", "Select" and "Kerrang".
In 2010, "Classic Rock" magazine ranked the album at number one in its list of the "150 Greatest Debut Albums Ever."
It is also included in the book "1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die".
The album is currently certified Platinum by the BPI and, according to the biography on the official site, has sold over two million copies around the world.
========,2,In popular culture.
Jackie Chan is celebrated in the lyrics of "Kung Fu", and used the song for the end credits of his movie "Rumble in the Bronx".
The song "Lose Control" was featured in the game "Gran Turismo", the first time one of the band's songs was used in a videogame (it was later followed by "Burn Baby Burn" from the album "Free All Angels", featured in "Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003", and by "Orpheus" from the album "Meltdown", featured in "").
========,2,Live performances.
Ash played the album in its entirety at London Roundhouse on September 5, 2008.

In June 2013, Ash announced a three date tour of Australia, playing 1977 in its entirety, followed by a set of greatest hits.

========,3,Hidden tracks.
The first 50,000 pressings of the CD feature the original version of "Jack Names the Planets" and its b-side "Don't Know" (February 1994), hidden in the album's pregap: they are accessed by 'rewinding' from track one.
