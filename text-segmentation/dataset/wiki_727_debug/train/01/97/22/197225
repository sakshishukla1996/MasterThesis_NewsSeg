========,1,preface.
Jharkhand ( "Bushland" or The land of forest) is a state in eastern India carved out of the southern part of Bihar on 15 November 2000.
The state shares its border with the states of Bihar to the north, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh to the west, Odisha to the south, and West Bengal to the east.
It has an area of .
The industrial city of Ranchi is its capital and Dumka its sub capital.
Dhanbad is the largest industrial city in the state, while Jamshedpur and Bokaro Steel City are the second and fourth most populous cities respectively.
Jharkhand accounts for 40% of the mineral resources of India but it suffers widespread poverty as 39.1 per cent of the population is below the poverty line and 19.6 per cent of the children under five years of age are malnourished.
The State is primarily a rural state as only 24 percent of the population resides in cities.
========,2,History.
According to writers including Gautam Kumar Bera, there was already a distinct geo-political, cultural entity called Jharkhand even before the Magadha Empire.
Bera's book (page 33) also refers to the Hindu epic Bhavishya Purana.
The tribal rulers, some of whom continue to thrive till today were known as the Munda Rajas, who basically had ownership rights to large farmlands.
For a greater part of Vedic age, Jharkhand remained unnoticed.
During the age of Mahajanpadas around 500 BC, India saw the emergence of 16 large states that controlled the entire Indian subcontinent.
In those days the Jharkhand state was a part of Magadha (ancient Bihar).
========,3,British rule.
In 1765, the region came under the control of the British East India Company.
The subjugation and colonisation of Jharkhand region by the British East India Company resulted in spontaneous resistance from the local people.
Almost one hundred years before Indian Rebellion of 1857, Adivasis of Jharkhand were already beginning what would become a series of repeated revolts against British colonial rule:
The period of revolts of the Adivasis to protect their Jharkhand land took place from 1771 to 1900.
The first ever revolt against the landlords and the British government was led by Tilka Manjhi, a Santhal leader in Santal tribal belt in 1771.
He wanted to liberate his people from the clutches of the unscrupulous landlords and restore the lands of their ancestors.
The British government sent its troops and crushed the uprisings of Tilka Manjhi.
Soon after in 1779, the Bhumij tribes rose in arms against the British rule in Manbhum, now in West Bengal.
This was followed by the Chero tribes unrest in Palamau.
They revolted against the British rule in 1800 AD.
Hardly seven years later in 1807, the Oraons in Barway murdered their big landlord of Srinagar west of Gumla.
Soon the uprisings spread around Gumla.
The tribal uprisings spread eastward to neighbouring Tamar areas of the Munda tribes.
They too rose in revolt in 1811 and 1813.
The Hos in Singhbhum were growing restless and came out in open revolt in 1820 and fought against the landlords and the British troops for two years.
This is called the Lakra Kol Risings 1820–1821.
Then came the great Kol Risings of 1832.
This was the first biggest tribal revolt that greatly upset the British administration in Jharkhand.
It was caused by an attempt by the Zamindars to oust the tribal peasants from their hereditary possessions.
The Santhal rebellion broke out in 1855 under the leadership of two brothers Sidhu and Kanhu.
They fought bitterly against the British troops but finally they too were crushed down.
Other notable Adivasi warriors are Jabra Paharia, Veer Budhu Bhagat, Poto Sardar, Telenga Kharia, Phulo-Jhano, Manki Munda, Gaya Munda.
Then Birsa Munda revolt, broke out in 1895 and lasted till 1900.
The revolt though mainly concentrated in the Munda belt of Khunti, Tamar, Sarwada and Bandgaon, pulled its supporters from Oraon belt of Lohardaga, Sisai and even Barway.
It was the longest and the greatest tribal revolt.
It was also the last tribal revolt in Jharkhand.
All of these uprisings were quelled by the British through massive deployment of troops across the region.
British Government faced a lot of tribal revolt in Chhota Nagpur Division.
Wherever resistance to British rule existed they tried to divide them.
The policy of "Divide and rule" was made effective by Lord Curzon, when he was Governor General of India.
He carried out Partition of Bengal in 1905, when the Princely states of Gangpur and Bonai of Chota Nagpur States were transferred from the control of Commissioner of Chhota Nagpur Division to Orissa Division and Princely states of Jashpur, Surguja, Udaipur, Chang Bhakar and Koriya were transferred from Chhota Nagpur Division to Chhattisgarh Division of Central Provinces, leading to shrinkage of Chhota Nagpur Division.
Due to popular resistance to Partition of Bengal, the two Bengals were reunited in 1912 by Governor General Harding, and the province of Bihar and Orissa was created by taking out of Bengal the Bihar Division, Chhota Nagpur Division and Orissa Division.
During this creation Midnapur, Purulia and Bankura remained with Bengal.
Thus, whenever there was reorganisation of provinces, Chhota Nagpur Division lost some area.
Thus during British rule, tribal areas, although geographically continuous, were put under different administrations.
Birsa Munda (1875-1900) and Sidho and Kanho are the legendary heroes of the tribal of Jharkhand state who fought against the oppressive rule of the British government.
The Birsa Munda movement of 1885-1900 was the most important among early uprisings against exploitation of the original inhabitants by non-tribal landowners and money lenders.
Birsa Munda fought for the tribal natural right over forests and land that was mercilessly being acquired by the British for exploitation.
After a long fight, Birsa Munda was captured by the British authorities and died in prison.
In 1914 the Tana Bhagat resistance movement started which gained the participation of more than 26,000 adivasis, and eventually merged with Mahatma Gandhi's Satyagraha and Civil Disobedience movement.
A landmark in the movement was the formation of the Chotanagpur Unnati Samaj in 1915, which acquired political overtones with the demand for a sub-state for the adivasis.
The demand was, however, turned down by the Simon commission.
The 20th-century Jharkhand movement may also be seen as moderate movement as compared to the bloody revolts of the 19th century.
Having the Chhotanagpur Tenancy Act 1908 to protect their lands, the tribal leaders now turned to socio-economic development of the people.
In 1914 Jatra Oraon started what is called the Tana Movement.
Later this movement joined the Satyagrah Movement of Mahatma Gandhi in 1920 and stopped giving land tax to the Government.
In 1915 the Chhotanagpur Unnati Samaj was started for the socio-economic development of the tribals.
This organisation had also political objectives in mind.
When the Simon Commission came to Patna in 1928, the Chhotanagpur Unnati Samaj sent its delegation and placed its demand for a separate Jharkhand State for self-rule by the tribals.
The Simon Commission however did not accede to the demand for a separate Jharkhand State.
Thereafter Theble Oraon organised Kishan Sabha in 1931.
In 1935 the Chhotanagpur Unnati Samaj and the Kishan Sabha were merged with a view to acquire political power.
========,3,Post-independence.
After the last Assembly election in the state threw up a hung Assembly, RJD's dependence on the Congress extended support on the precondition that RJD will not pose a hurdle to the passage of the Bihar reorganization Bill (Jharkhand Bill).
Finally, with the support from both RJD and Congress, the ruling coalition at the Centre led by the BJP which has made statehood its mail poll plank in the region in successive polls earlier, cleared the Jharkhand Bill in the monsoon session of the Parliament this year, thus paving the way for the creation of a separate Jharkhand state.
========,3,Jharkhand statehood.
The dynamics of resources and the politics of development still influence the socio-economic structures in Jharkhand, which was carved out of the relatively under developed southern part of Bihar.
According to the 1991 census, the state has a population of over 20 million out of which 28% is tribal while 12% of the people belong to scheduled castes.
Jharkhand has 24 districts, 260 blocks and 32,620 villages out of which only 45% have access to electricity while only 8,484 are connected by roads.
Jharkhand is the leading producer of mineral wealth in the country after Chhattisgarh state, endowed as it is with vast variety of minerals like iron ore, coal, copper ore, mica, bauxite, graphite, limestone, and uranium.
Jharkhand is also known for its vast forest resources.
========,3,Naxal insurgency.
Jharkhand has been at the centre of the Naxalite-Maoist insurgency.
Since the uprising of the Naxalites in 1967, 6,000 people have been killed in fighting between the Naxalites and counter-insurgency operations by the police, and its paramilitary groups such as the Salwa Judum.
Despite having a presence in almost 7.80% of India's geographical area (home to 5.50% of India's population), the state of Jharkhand is part of the "Naxal Belt" comprising 92,000 square kilometres, where the highest concentrations of the groups estimated 20,000 combatants fight.
Part of this is due to the fact that the state harbours a rich abundance of natural resources, while its people live in abject poverty and destitution.
The impoverished state provides ample recruits for the communist insurgents, who argue that they are fighting on behalf of the landless poor that see few benefits from the resource extractions.
As the federal government holds a monopoly on sub-surface resources in the state, the tribal population is prevented from staking any claim on the resources extracted from their land.
In response, the insurgents have recently begun a campaign of targeting infrastructure related to the extraction of resources vital for Indian energy needs, such as coal.
On 5 March 2007, Sunil Mahato, a member of the national parliament, was shot dead by Naxalite rebels near Kishanpur while watching a football match on the Hindu festival of Holi.
His widow, Suman Mahato, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha candidate, won the Jamshedpur Lok Sabha by-election in September 2007 and served in parliament until 2009.
========,2,Flora and fauna.
Jharkhand has a rich variety of flora and fauna.
The National Parks and the Zoological Gardens located in the state of Jharkhand present a panorama of this variety.
Part of the reason for the variety and diversity of flora and fauna found in Jharkhand state may be accredited to the Palamau Tiger Reserves under the Project Tiger.
This reserve is abode to hundreds of species of flora and fauna, as indicated within brackets: mammals (39), snakes (8), lizards (4), fish (6), insects (21), birds (170), seed bearing plants and trees (97), shrubs and herbs (46), climbers, parasites and semi-parasites (25), and grasses and bamboos (17).
========,2,Religion.
As per the 2011 census, Hinduism is the majority religion in the state at 67.8%, followed by Islam at 14.5% and Christianity at 4.3%.
Other religions, primarily Sarnaism, constitute 12.8% of the population.
========,2,Cuisine.
Jharkhandis have a cuisine in which spices are rarely used and rice is the staple diet.
They prepare different dishes of rice, different types of Rotis, Litti Chokha, Pani puri (Gupchup), Pittha, Dhuska, Dudhauri, kera-dudhauri, Jhalmudhi etc.
Dhuska is a famous dish of Jharkhand cooked with mashed rice and pulses and served with either aaloo dum or mutton curry; kera-dudhauri is a famous dish prepared with milk, rice, ghee and gur.
In many parts of Jharkhand including Panch Pargana area (Bundu, Rahe, Sonahatu, Silli, Angara, Arki and Tamar Blocks of Ranchi & Khunti districts) a special food item "Charpa" is prepared by frying mashed rice mixed with spicy vegetable preparations; hence the name follows viz.
Sembi Charpa, Egg Charpa and many more depending upon the ingredient vegetable source.
Local alcoholic drinks include rice beer, originally known as "Handiya", named after the vessel (earthen pot) used to make it.
Handiya is culturally associated with native i.e.
Tribals as well as Sadan, as this drink is consumed by both men and women, on social occasions like marriage and other festivals.
Another common liquor is called "Mahu", made from fruit/flowers of the "Mahua" tree (Madhukam Indicum).
========,2,Administrative districts.
The state was formed with 18 districts that were formerly part of south Bihar.
Some of these districts were reorganised to form 6 new districts, namely, Latehar, Saraikela Kharsawan, Jamtara, Sahebganj, Khunti and Ramgarh.
At present, the state has 5 Divisions and 24 Districts.
One interesting thing about Jharkhand is that all its districts, except Lohardaga and Khunti, share a border with a neighboring state.
========,2,Economy.
Jharkhand has several towns and innumerable villages with civic amenities.
Urbanization ratio is 24.1% and the per capita annual income is US$726.8.
Jharkhand also has immense mineral resources: minerals ranging from (ranking in the country within bracket) from iron ore (1st), coal(3rd), copper ore (1st), mica (1st), bauxite (3rd), Manganese, limestone, china clay, fire clay, graphite (8th), kainite (1st), chromite (2nd), asbestos (1st), thorium (3rd), sillimanite, uranium (Jaduguda mines, Narwa Pahar) (1st) and even gold (Rakha Mines) (6th) and silver and several other minerals.
Large deposits of coal and iron ore support concentration of industry, in centres like Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Bokaro and Ranchi.
Tata Steel, a "S&P CNX 500" conglomerate has its corporate office and main plant in Tatanagar, Jharkhand.
It reported a gross income of .
204,910 million for 2005.
NTPC will start coal production from its captive mine in state in 2011–12, for which the company will be investing about Rs 1,800 crore.
========,2,Transport.
========,3,Air.
Ranchi Airport is the largest domestic airport in the state with air connectivity to major Indian cities of Delhi, Kolkata, Bangalore, Mumbai among others.
Other airports present in the state are Bokaro Airport, Jamshedpur Airport, Chakulia Airport, Dumka Airport and Dhanbad Airport who mostly run private and charter flights.
========,3,Ports.
Jharkhand is landlocked state but has numerous rivers and waterways.
A multi-model port has been planned at Sahebganj where river Ganges flows.
The project is estimated to cost INR 6,500 crores and phase-1 is estimated to be completed by 2019.
========,2,Education.
As per the 2011 census conducted by Government of India the official literacy rate for the state was 67.63% (Male: 78.45%; Female: 56.21%) with 9 districts above the average literacy rate:
***LIST***.
Since the formation of the new state, the Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) has been implementing four projects to spread elementary education: DPEP, SSA, NPEGEL, and KGBV.
The state has been moving towards the goal of universal elementary education but the target of hundred percent enrolment and retention of children in schools has not yet been attained.
Jharkhand has made primary education so accessible that 95% of children of ages 6–11 are enrolled in school, as opposed to 56% in 1993–94, so this will likely to improve literacy a great deal.
Some of the better known schools which operate nationally and regionally are Vikas Vidyalaya, Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, DAV Hehal, St. Thomas School, Delhi Public School, Oxford Public School, De Nobili School, Kendriya Vidyalaya, Chinmaya Public School, Loyola school, Sacred Heart School, St. Xavier's, Shishu Mandir, and Surendranath Centenary School.
Students from Jharkhand rank well in almost all competitive exams at the national level.
========,3,Schools.
The medium of instruction in schools is Hindi/English with English/Hindi/Sanskrit/Bengali/Odia as second language.
After 10 years of schooling, students can join 2 years of Intermediate course (or +2 courses) in Arts, Science and Commerce.
This is followed by 3 years of degree courses (graduation)or 4 years of Engineering/Agriculture/Medicine degree.
On May 2008, Jharkhand became the first in India to introduce free haircuts for poor students.
40,000 barbers will be employed with a monthly salary of 1000 rupees (25 US dollars) which will cost the state government 40 million rupees (1 million US dollars).
Loyola School, Jamshedpur is one of the oldest schools in Jharkhand.
The institution was established in 1947 by the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), a Roman Catholic religious order founded by St. Ignatius Loyola in 1540.
========,2,Health.
Because of its mild climate, Jharkhand, particularly its capital Ranchi, has been like a health resort.
As far back as 1918, facilities were set up for treatment of mentally challenged.
European Mental Hospital was established along with Indian Mental Hospital.
Today they are called Central Institute of Psychiatry and Ranchi Institute of Neuro-psychiatry and Allied Sciences respectively.
In certain areas of Jharkhand, poverty and consequent malnutrition have given rise to diseases like tuberculosis (TB).
In fact, TB has assumed epidemic proportions in certain areas of the state.
For management and treatment of such TB, Itki TB Sanatorium, Ranchi, established in 1928 has been doing exemplary work as a premier institute for clinical and programmatic management of TB.
The Itki TB Sanatorium is well equipped and accredited by the Indian government for quality assurance and Culture and Drug Sensitivity Testing for M.TB.
It provides free of cost treatment for TB as well as Drug resistant TB.
Likewise, in the field of treatment of cancer, Tata Main Hospital, Jamshedpur, is rendering pioneering work.
In the same way Bokaro General Hospital equipped with modern facilities for the treatment Cancer and heart related problems with capacity of 1100 beds one of the largest in eastern India.
Although several public and private health facilities are available in the state, overall infrastructure for dispensing health related services require improvements.
An exception is the famous Tata Motors Hospital which is an example of an ISO 14001 and 18001 certified hospital with DNB teaching facilities.
Ranchi, the capital, has witnessed a sharp growth in the number of hospitals.
Hospitals like Orchid Medical Centre have introduced world class healthcare services to the people of the state.
However, in rural areas facilities are still scarce and reliant on foreign aid projects (such as Traditional Healthcare in Datom) for the establishment of clinics Fluoride in groundwater presents a public health problem in Jharkhand.
A recent survey led by the Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, Ranchi in collaboration with UNICEF in the northwest districts of Palamau and Garhwa found fluoride levels above the drinking WHO drinking water guidelines.
Excessive amounts of fluoride in drinking water can lead to dental fluorosis, prevalent bone fractures, and skeletal fluorosis, an irreversible disabling condition.
Some work has focused on combating fluorosis through increased calcium intake by consuming local plants.
Researchers at Princeton University and the Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, Ranchi are currently investigating defluoridation options, while performing an epidemiological survey to assess the extent of fluoride linked health problems and the impact of future interventions.
Almost 80% of Jharkhand's people are farmers, although it contains 40% of India's mineral reserves it has some of India's poorest people, in Summer 2009 the state was threatened by drought, with people criticising the government for not providing food aid or assistance.
========,2,Animal husbandry and veterinary services.
Jharkhand has a diverse domestic animal population, including local and crossbred cattle, black Bengal goat, chhotanagpuri sheep, murrah and local buffalo, broilers and ducks of many varieties.
