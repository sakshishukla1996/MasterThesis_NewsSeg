Around 2007, the villages of Clearwater, Orchard, Royal and Verdigre became the Unified School District #1 and began sharing administration between them.
Subsequent to this, in 2009, presumably due to a lack of funds and a lack of student participation on both ends, school rivals, the Orchard Orioles football team, and the Clearwater Cardinals football team, combined to form the O-C Cyclones.
After the initial trial year, it was decided that all sports teams between the two schools would combine under the O-C Cyclones banner.
The school systems have since combined to form the Clearwater-Orchard Public Schools.
Orchard is served by the Orchard Public Library.
