========,2,History.
Montana City is located on top of one of the oldest prehistoric sites in the state of Montana.
As early as 9,000 BCE, Native Americans came to Montana City to collect chert, a rock similar to flint which was used to make spear tips, arrowheads, and knives.
White American explorers discovered gold at the site on July 2, 1862, and later that year United States Army Captain Jason L. Fisk brought a mule train from Minnesota which stopped at the site and built the first houses that became Montana City.
The town became one of the most important mining centers in Montana during the height of the gold rush in the 1860s.
The Montana Town Company laid out the city in 1864, naming it after the state's new territorial name.
Chinese miners took over from whites when the mines began to play out in 1868, and the town saw a brief revival after the arrival of the railroads and the establishment of a post office in the 1880s.
At its height in the 1880s, Montana City had 3,000 residents and competed for the location of the state capital.
Montana City was almost a ghost town for most of the 20th century until the Permanente Cement Company built a cement manufacturing plant there in 1940.
Today, Montana City is a bedroom community serving Helena.
