========,2,History.
The historical anecdotes contained in this section were derived from the 2011 book "Ladue Found", written by Charlene Bry, former editor and owner of "The Ladue News."
Ladue began as a farming community St. Louis County suburb.
After St. Louis City ejected St. Louis County in 1876, Ladue was known as ranges 4 and 5 of "Township 45," with Clayton being the political hub.
Original Township 45 farming families included the Dennys, Dwyers, Conways, McCutcheons, McKnights (all Irish), Litzsinger, Schraders, Spoedes (all German), LaDues (French), Warsons, Lays, Barnes, Prices, and Watsons (all English).
Once automobiles replaced horse and wagon as the primary mode of transportation, farmers in the area began selling portions of their land to city workers who wished to live outside of the urban setting.
Three small villages (Village of LaDue, Village of Deer Creek, and the Village of McKnight) merged in 1936 to become what is now known as Ladue.
Ladue was named from Ladue Road, the main thoroughfare in the area that led from St. Louis City to wealthy entrepreneur Peter Albert LaDue's large property at the current intersection of Warson Rd.
and Ladue Rd.
(including St. Louis Country Club).
Peter Albert LaDue was a French immigrant who fought in the Revolutionary War as a member of the 1st New York Regiment.
After the war, he moved to St. Louis and later became a prominent attorney, alderman, and investor in the 1840s and 1850s.
========,2,Controversies.
In the early 1990s the city tried to force a woman to take down a yard sign stating "Say No to the War in the Persian Gulf, Call Congress Now" as it violated a city law.
The ACLU sued arguing that the right to place the sign was protected by the 1st Amendment.
The ensuing legal battle went to the United States Supreme Court which unanimously ruled, in "City of Ladue v. Gilleo", that the right to place the sign was protected by the Constitution.
In 1986 the City of Ladue won a case against E. Terrence Jones and Joan Kelly Horn, a couple who had lived together for four years and who each brought children from a previous relationship.
Ladue officials had requested that they marry or leave their home.
The Missouri Court of Appeals sided with the city, stating in "City of Ladue v. Horn" that "A man and woman living together, sharing pleasures and certain responsibilities, does not per se constitute a family in even the conceptual sense.
[...] There is no doubt that there is a governmental interest in marriage and in preserving the integrity of the biological or legal family.
There is no concomitant governmental interest in keeping together a group of unrelated persons, no matter how closely they simulate a family.
Further, there is no state policy which commands that groups of people may live under the same roof in any section of a municipality they choose."
Under Chapter 213 of the Missouri Human Rights Act (§213.040.1), passed after the "Ladue v. Horn" case, housing discrimination on the basis of familial status is now an unlawful practice.
In 2010 the former chief of police, Larry White, sued the City of Ladue for wrongful termination.
The suit was dismissed by the Circuit Court of St Louis County in 2012 and the dismissal upheld by the Missouri Court of Appeals in 2013.
Press reports have indicated the town's municipal court judge fixed at least one ticket for a well-connected person.
Despite comprising only 0.88% of the local population, black drivers in Ladue comprised 575 (of 4107 total, or 14%) stops in 2014.
The resulting "disparity index" indicates a black driver was 15.98 times more likely than the average driver to be stopped by the Ladue Police Department in 2014, but the Police Department contends the statistics are skewed by the local racial composition.
