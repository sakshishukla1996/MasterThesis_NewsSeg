Valentine was founded in 1883 when the Sioux City and Pacific Railroad was extended to that point.
It was named for Edward K. Valentine, a Nebraska representative.
As late as 1967, Valentine was split between two time zones.
As described in one news report, "The mountain and central time zones meet at the center of Main Street, so an hour separates the two curb lines."
According to the report, when clocks were required to be set back one hour for daylight saving time, Valentine's post office (which was in the central zone) split the difference and turned back its clock by only half an hour.
Valentine participates in an annual re-mailing program where thousands of pieces of mail flow into the local United States Post Office so that they can be re-mailed with a special Valentine's Day postmark and verse.
In 2007, "National Geographic Adventure" magazine included Valentine in its list of the best ten wilderness towns and cities.
