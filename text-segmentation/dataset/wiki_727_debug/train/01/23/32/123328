========,2,Jail.
In 2004-05, a Texas prison and jail development consortium convinced Hardin's industrial development authority to float bonds to build the speculative Two Rivers Detention Facility, a $27 million jail designed for 464 inmates, located on a field.
The facility was slated to open in July 2007 but the state of Montana did not approve it.
The Authority bonds defaulted on May 1, 2008.
The consortium's contract terminated in January 2009 without any prisoners ever being housed in the jail.
In November 2009 the Two Rivers Board hired its fifth director.
A reserve fund of $814,000 was earmarked to maintain the building for possible future use.
It remained complete and vacant for over seven years, though it was partially filled for 18 months.
By February 2016, empty once again, it had cost the city $582,595 paid to Two Rivers to maintain it since 2004.
Due to unpaid interest on the defaulted bonds, its estimated indebtedness had increased to over $40 million by December 2015.
