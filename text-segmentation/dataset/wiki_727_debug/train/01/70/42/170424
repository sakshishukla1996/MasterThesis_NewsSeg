========,1,preface.
Mega Man, alternatively written as Megaman and MegaMan, known as in Japan, is a video game franchise created by Capcom, starring the robot character Mega Man, or one of his many counterparts.
"Mega Man", released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987, was the first in a series of over 50 games on multiple systems.
By March 2015, the series had sold approximately thirty million copies worldwide,
The classic "Mega Man" series consists of ten main titles and a spin-off, "Mega Man & Bass", as well as all Game Boy, Sega Genesis, Sega Game Gear and other console titles featuring the original design of Mega Man.
The classic series is considered to be the origin of the story, with "Mega Man" being the first installment, and continuing with ten direct sequels.
Chronologically after "Mega Man 8" comes "Mega Man & Bass", followed by "Mega Man 9" and "Mega Man 10".
Although the classic series has yet to reach an ending, the storyline shifts to the "Mega Man X" series, followed by the "Mega Man Zero" series, "Mega Man ZX" and "Mega Man Legends".
Although it is confirmed that the "Legends" series takes place sometime in the distant future after the "ZX" series, there is an uncertain amount of time as to when it actually takes place.
All series follow one continuous timeline except for "Mega Man Battle Network" and "Mega Man Star Force", which exist in an alternate universe (one in which network technology flourished instead of robotics technology), with "Star Force" occurring two centuries after the "Battle Network" series.
The official source book "Rockman Perfect Memories" outlines the "Classic", "X", and "Legends" series and makes mention of the "Battle Network" and "Zero" series (which were fairly new at the time of the book's publication).
While the "ZX" and "Star Force" series were not yet conceived when the source book was published, Capcom is explicit within the games themselves regarding their placement in the timeline(s).
========,2,Games.
========,3,Original series.
In the story behind the original series, Mega Man is an android originally named Rock, created as a lab assistant by the scientist Dr. Light with Dr Wily as his assistant.
Following treachery by Dr. Wily in which he reprogrammed most of Dr Light's robots, Rock volunteered to be converted into a fighting robot to defend the world from Wily's violent robotic threats.
Thus becoming Mega Man.
Though all incarnations of "Mega Man" feature unique stories, settings, and characters, they nevertheless share several common features.
All main "Mega Man" games released prior to 1997 are side scrolling action platformers.
The player character must fight through the levels using Mega Man's "Mega Buster"—a cannon attached to his arm—to shoot the robotic enemies inhabiting his environment.
When Mega Man was released in 1987, the characteristic that made it revolutionary was the choice given to the player of which robot master to attempt first.
After defeating a Robot Master—the boss of a level—Mega Man gains the ability to use that Robot Master's special weapon.
Each Robot Master is representative of a specific element or object, with such bosses as Fire Man, Ice Man, Guts Man, and Elec Man.
The weapons Mega Man gains share the theme of the defeated boss.
After defeating all of the Robot Masters, Mega Man travels to a multi-stage fortress to confront Dr. Wily, the person responsible for the robotic enemies' destructive acts.
In the fortress, Mega Man fights past new bosses, clones of the game's Robot Masters, and Wily, who is usually in a large multi-phase war machine.
Enemies are weak to at least one weapon; for instance, Fire Man will take more damage from Ice Man's weapon than from other weapons.
This concept draws inspiration from rock-paper-scissors.
Robot Master levels can generally be completed in any order, resulting in a strategic hallmark of the series: determining the best order to defeat bosses and earn weapons.
Sequels of "Mega Man" games contain new enemies alongside familiar ones, new bosses and weapons, and perhaps new gadgets.
Later installments of the game give the player the option of commanding other player characters with different abilities, such as Proto Man, Duo, and Bass.
To date, the "Classic" series has not reached a definite conclusion, although later entries in the series have hinted at possible connections to the "X" series (such as the "Roboenza" of "Mega Man 10" possibly being a precursor to the Maverick Virus and Wily's schematic of a robot resembling Zero in the ending of "Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters").
But due to the "Classic" series' light-hearted and nostalgic nature, it may never reach a definite conclusion.
Originally developed for the NES, the original Mega Man series experienced graphical improvements in fourth and fifth generation installments.
The series had no titles developed for sixth generation consoles but returned in the seventh generation purposely sporting graphics, sound and gameplay similar to the original NES titles to inspire a nostalgic look and feel, distributed as downloadable content instead of retail titles like the previous installments.
========,3,"Mega Man X".
***LIST***.
Capcom wanted a redesign in graphics and control as the "Mega Man" series moved from the NES to the SNES, prompting the creation of the "Mega Man X" series in 1993.
Set in the future, this series follows the story of Mega Man's successor, Mega Man X, a new, advanced robot that has complete free will over his actions, thoughts and feelings.
This character, often referred to as simply "X", is also a creation of Dr. Light, put into suspended animation and uncovered 100 years in the future by a researcher named Dr. Cain.
The "Mega Man X" series features more realistic 16-bit graphics and greater freedom of movement.
In the "Mega Man X" series, the characters grow in abilities and power as the game progresses.
========,3,"Mega Man Legends".
***LIST***.
Beginning on the PlayStation in 1997, a 3D action game series called "Mega Man Legends" was created to take advantage of the console's advanced graphics hardware.
This series is in the same world as the other games, though thousands of years in the future.
The world is covered by immense bodies of water, marked by a re-occurrence of several major characters from the original series in different situations.
The hero, Mega Man (Rock) Volnutt, is a relic hunter called a "Digger" who scavenges various ruins laden throughout the world in search of refractor shards that can be mined and traded as currency.
"Mega Man Legends" brings the gameplay into 3D and is an action adventure with role-playing game elements.
========,3,"Mega Man Battle Network".
***LIST***.
"Mega Man Battle Network", a series primarily on the Game Boy Advance, began in 2001 as a way for the "Mega Man" games to branch out into the role-playing video game market and to celebrate "MegaMan"s 15th anniversary.
This series features a Net Navi called "MegaMan.EXE".
Net Navis act as virtual assistants to Operators, such as the protagonist Lan, an elementary school student and future hero who uses his Net Navi to help battle computer viruses and other Internet-based threats.
The game combines elements from collectible card games to create a unique fast-paced battle system.
An anime series, "MegaMan NT Warrior", was also produced, ending with 209 episodes and a 50-minute film adaptation.
"Mega Man Network Transmission", the only entry in the series released on a home console rather than a handheld, takes place chronologically between the first two "Battle Network" games, although it was released between the third and fourth.
It is also different from other titles in the Battle Network universe in that its game play reminds strongly of the "Classic" series.
========,3,"Mega Man Zero".
***LIST***.
In 2002, a follow-up series to the "Mega Man X" franchise was developed for the Game Boy Advance which starred Zero, a character from "Mega Man X".
The series revolved around Zero battling a powerful human-supremacy force as he protects the oppressed remaining reploids.
In the "Mega Man Zero" series, the gameplay is largely similar to Zero's play style in the later "Mega Man X" titles and features an in-depth ranking system that rewards the player with new abilities and enhancements (such as copied abilities from boss characters) in exchange for better play performance.
In the fourth title, Zero can also physically steal weapons from enemies (such as axes and guns).
========,3,"Mega Man ZX".
***LIST***.
The first game in the "Mega Man ZX" series was released in 2006.
It takes place about 200 years after the "Zero" series in which progression has led to the mixing of physical attributes between humans and robots; humans are given the physical advantages of robots, and robots are given lifespans.
Therefore, this is the first title in the main storyline in which the player can control a human character.
Players collect Biometals containing data on the legendary heroes of the past (including X, Zero, and the Four Guardians of the "Mega Man Zero" series).
Using these Biometals, they are able to "Mega-Merge" with them to don the powers of the fallen heroes.
========,3,"Mega Man Star Force".
***LIST***.
A follow-up to the "Mega Man Battle Network" series and released on the Nintendo DS, "Star Forces"s launch commemorated the 20th anniversary of the "Mega Man" franchise.
The "Star Force" games are very similar to the "Battle Network" games, and also takes place roughly 200 years later in the timeline.
Network technology has progressed with electromagnetic wave technology to connect the world via radio waves.
The series stars a timid boy named Geo Stelar and an extraterrestrial EM-wave being named Omega-Xis who can merge into an EM-Human known as "Mega Man," allowing the player to explore both the real world and the EM-world.
Although each title has a different set of antagonists, they are usually EM-beings that are able to merge with humans to create new threats.
The gameplay is very similar to the "Battle Network" series with an over-the-shoulder battle system and more simplified collectible card game elements, as well as faster-paced battle mechanics.
An anime based on this series began airing on TV Tokyo in October 2006 for 76 episodes.
========,3,"Rockman Xover".
"Rockman Xover" (ロックマン Xover "Rokkuman Kurosuōbā", pronounced Rockman Crossover) is a title for Apple's iOS platform marking the 25th anniversary of the "Mega Man" franchise, and was released on November 29, 2012 on the Japanese iTunes Store.
The game features a new protagonist, OVER-1 (オーバー ワン "Ōbā Wan"), a Reploid created by Dr. Light and Dr. Cossack, confronting villains from the entire "Mega Man" franchise, who have crossed between dimensions to join forces.
Capcom have stated that a release in North America has been put on hold due to largely negative feedback from fans.
The game ceased operations entirely on March 31, 2015.
========,2,Timeline.
The timeline for the series and its spinoffs is somewhat complicated.
According to "Rockman Perfect Memories", an official Capcom sourcebook only available in Japan:
========,2,In other media.
========,3,In other video games.
Various incarnations of Mega Man appear as playable fighters in the "Marvel vs. Capcom" series.
The original was a playable fighter in ' and '.
He is assisted by his companion robots, Rush, Beat and Eddie.
His sister robot, Roll, is also playable in both games, but is a secret character in the first game.
Although he did not make a playable appearance in ', and its successor, "Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3", Zero from "Mega Man X" and Tron Bonne from "Mega Man Legends" appear as representatives for the series.
Mega Man X appears as an alternate costume for Zero and Frank West and as a card in Heroes and Heralds mode.
The original Mega Man appears in the arcade endings of Thor and Nova, and also appears on a poster in the Days of Future Past stage, and finally, as another card in Heroes and Heralds Mode.
Mega Man X will appear as a playable character in '.
MegaMan.EXE and Zero both appear as bonus playable characters in the fighting game "Onimusha Blade Warriors", while a different version of Mega Man, based on his appearance on the American box art of the first game, appears as a playable fighter in the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita versions of "Street Fighter X Tekken".
Mega Man Volnutt and Roll also make an appearance in "", with Zero added to the U.S. version.
In 2013, Mega Man was confirmed as a playable character in "Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U".
An amiibo based on his appearance was confirmed on November 11, and can be utilized in "Super Smash Bros." as well as "Mario Kart 8" where it can be scanned to unlock a costume for the player's Mii based on Mega Man's.
In "Super Mario Maker", the player can unlock a Mega Man costume by scanning the character's amiibo.
========,3,Television appearances.
The classic series was the source material for two animated television series both aptly named "Mega Man" and featuring the heroes, villains, and themes of the games.
The first show was a three-part OVA called ' developed in Japan; the other, simply called "Mega Man", was developed specifically for North American audiences by animation studio Ruby-Spears.
Spin-off versions of the hero led to the series "Mega Man NT Warrior" and "Mega Man Star Force".
Mega Man was also a main character in Nintendo-themed series '.
A new 26-episode animated series produced by Dentsu Entertainment and developed by Man of Action Studios is currently planned for a 2018 release alongside the franchise's 30th anniversary.
========,3,Artbooks.
Various artbooks and source books have been released for many years in Japan, often including conceptual artwork, interviews with production staff, and background information on the storyline and concepts that are not present within the games themselves.
One of the most well-known is the "Rockman Perfect Memories" sourcebook released in 2002 which first confirmed the presence of an alternate timeline (for "Battle Network"), as well as exactly where the "Legends" series fit into the fictional "Mega Man" universe.
Recently a series of artbooks called the "Official Complete Works" has been published for individual "Mega Man" series, showcasing a large collection of artwork and background information.
To date, books for the "Zero", "Classic" and "X" (released together as "R20"), "Star Force", and "Battle Network" series have been produced.
Although these books have for many years been exclusive to Japan, UDON Entertainment Corporation has finished translating the "Official Complete Works" series for the North American market, called "R25".
========,3,Comics and manga.
Mega Man has also been featured in many comics and manga in Japan, although few have been localized in North America.
The most well-known series is produced by Hitoshi Ariga (who went on to provide character designs and artwork for future official Capcom releases, including the Super Famicom game "Mega Man and Bass").
The series began with "Rockman Remix", followed with "Rockman Megamix", and is currently being serialized as "Rockman Gigamix".
The "Megamix" portion of the series would eventually be brought to North American shores thanks to UDON Entertainment Corporation, also responsible for the localization of the short "Mega Man ZX" manga by Shin Ogino.
In the original "Mega Man" series, Dr. Light was known as Dr. "R"ight, so many of his robots featured in Ariga's comic have "R"s in their designs.
UDON did not alter this detail in the English version of "Mega Man Megamix".
In addition, Viz Media localized the 13-volume "Rockman EXE" manga by Ryo Takamisaki under the name "MegaMan NT Warrior".
Takamisaki would later serialize a short adaptation of "Mega Man Star Force 3" that was never published outside Japan.
Some other manga series that have not been localized outside Japan include a 12-volume "Rockman X" adaptation by Yoshihiro Iwamoto, over 15 "Classic" and "X" adaptations by Shigeto Ikehara, a light-hearted adaptation of "Rockman Zero" by Hideto Kajima, a slapstick adaptation of "Shooting Star Rockman" by Masaya Itagaki, another "Battle Network" adaptation by Jun Keijima and Miho Asada called "Rockman EXE Battle Story", and a short series of slapstick "Battle Network" and "Star Force"-themed adaptations by Takumi Kawano.
Dreamwave Productions and Brazilian publisher Magnum Press made its own comic books based on the classic game series.
The Brazilian series, entitled "Novas Aventuras de Megaman" ("New Adventures of Megaman"), were originally published and sold in Brazil between 1996 and 1997 and drew certain criticism for featuring bizarrely altered storylines (with characters from several installments appearing at random, as well as erotic and sexual innuendo in Mega Man and X's relationship with Roll) as well for frequent nudity involving Roll and an original character named Princess, which attempted to take over the status as the main character of the comics; its sudden end on a cliffhanger is rumored to have been caused by Capcom's lawsuit threat to the publishers.
The Dreamwave series lasted only four issues and also ended abruptly, with plot-threads from the first three issues being dropped completely in the final issue and the inclusion of a short story promising a "Mega Man X" follow-up that never materialized.
This was one of several Dreamwave Capcom comics that were cut short or simply never made it to issue #1, including "", "Darkstalkers" and "Rival Schools".
========,3,Junior novel.
In 1990, a junior novel version of "Mega Man 2" was released as part of the "Worlds of Power" novel series.
Mega Man is turned human by Dr. Light during an accident in a machine designed to clone Mega Man.
Instead of a Mega Buster, human Mega Man uses a hand gun and instead of being able to copy the robot master's weapons, he instead takes them off of their arms.
For some reason being human does not affect him much and he is still able to consume E-drinks (Energy Tanks) and gain a power boost.
The book follows the general plot of Mega Man 2 and even provides game hints at the end of some chapters.
========,3,Music.
Ascertaining the identity of video game composers, especially prior to the fifth generation of consoles, can be difficult, as the composers were often uncredited or credited under a pseudonym.
Recent soundtrack releases and interviews have discovered the true names of the composers; and in some cases, specific track credits.
The indie rock music group The Protomen dedicated their first two albums to a rock opera based on Megaman, called "The Protomen" (2005) and "" (2009).
========,2,Legacy.
"Mega Man" series director Keiji Inafune announced the similarly themed "Mighty No.
9" in September 2013, but after much controversy surrounding delays and mishandling, the game was released in June 2016 to a mixed-to-negative reception.
Batterystaple Games released the "Mega Man X"-inspired "20XX" in 2014.
