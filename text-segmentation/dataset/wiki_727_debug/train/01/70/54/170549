========,1,preface.
Fallout is a series of post-apocalyptic retrofuturistic role-playing video games.
It was created by Interplay Entertainment.
Although the series is set during the 22nd and 23rd centuries, its atompunk retrofuturistic setting and artwork are influenced by the post-war culture of 1950s America, and its combination of hope for the promises of technology, and lurking fear of nuclear annihilation.
A forerunner for "Fallout" is "Wasteland", a 1988 video game of which the "Fallout" series is regarded to be a spiritual successor.
Although the game worlds are different, the background story, inhabitants, locations, and characters draw many parallels.
The first two titles in the series, "Fallout" and "Fallout 2", were developed by Black Isle Studios.
Micro Forté and 14 Degrees East's 2001 ' is a tactical role-playing game.
In 2004, Interplay closed Black Isle Studios, and continued to produce an action game with role-playing elements for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, ' without Black Isle Studios.
A third entry in the main series, "Fallout 3", was released in 2008 by Bethesda Softworks.
It was followed by "" in 2010, developed by Obsidian Entertainment.
"Fallout 4" was announced on June 3, 2015, and was released on November 10, 2015.
Bethesda Softworks owns the rights to produce "Fallout" games.
Soon after acquiring the rights to the intellectual property (IP), Bethesda licensed the rights to make a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) version of "Fallout" to Interplay.
The MMORPG got as far as beta stage under Interplay, but a lengthy legal dispute between Bethesda Softworks and Interplay halted the development of the game and led to its eventual cancellation, as Bethesda claimed in court that Interplay had not met the terms and conditions of the licensing contract.
The case was decided in favor of Bethesda.
========,2,Main series.
========,3,"Fallout" (1997).
Released in 1997, "Fallout" takes place in a post-apocalyptic Southern California, beginning in the year 2161.
The protagonist, referred to as the Vault Dweller, is tasked with recovering a water chip in the Wasteland to replace the broken one in their underground shelter home, Vault 13.
Afterwards, the Vault Dweller must thwart the plans of a group of mutants, led by a grotesque entity named the Master.
"Fallout" was originally intended to run under the GURPS role-playing game system.
However, a disagreement with the creator of GURPS, Steve Jackson, over the game's violent content required Black Isle Studios to develop the new SPECIAL system.
"Fallout"s atmosphere and artwork are reminiscent of post-WWII America and the nuclear paranoia that was widespread at that time.
========,3,"Fallout 2" (1998).
"Fallout 2" was released in 1998, with several improvements over the first game, including an improved game engine, the ability to set attitudes of non-player character (NPC) party members and the ability to push people who are blocking doors.
Additional features included several changes to the game world, including significantly more pop culture jokes and parodies, such as multiple Monty Python-referencing special random encounters, and self-parodying dialogue that broke the fourth wall to mention game mechanics.
"Fallout 2" takes place eighty years after "Fallout", and centers around a descendant of the Vault Dweller, the protagonist of "Fallout".
The player assumes the role of the Chosen One as they try to save their village, Arroyo, from severe famine and droughts.
After saving the village, the Chosen One must save it again, this time from the Enclave, the remnants of the pre-war United States Government.
========,3,"Fallout 3" (2008).
"Fallout 3" was developed by Bethesda Game Studios and released on October 28, 2008.
The story picks up thirty years after the setting of "Fallout 2" and 200 years after the nuclear war that devastated the game's world.
The player-character is a Vault-dweller in Vault 101 who is forced to flee when the Overseer tries to arrest them in response to their father leaving the Vault.
Once free, the player is dubbed the Lone Wanderer and ventures into the Wasteland in and around Washington, D.C., known as the Capital Wasteland, to find their father.
It differs from previous games in the series by utilizing 3D graphics, a free-roam gaming world, and real-time combat, in contrast to previous games' 2D isometric graphics and turn-based combat.
It was developed simultaneously for the PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 using the Gamebryo engine.
It received highly positive reviews, garnering 94/100, 92/100, and 93/100 averages scores on Metacritic for the PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game, respectively.
It won IGN's 2008 Overall Game of the Year Award, Xbox 360 Game of the Year, Best RPG, and Best Use of Sound, as well as E3's Best of the Show and Best Role Playing Game.
========,3,"Fallout: New Vegas" (2010).
"Fallout: New Vegas" was developed by Obsidian Entertainment and released on October 19, 2010.
The development team included developers who previously worked on "Fallout" and "Fallout 2".
"Fallout: New Vegas" is not a direct sequel to "Fallout 3"; rather, it is a stand-alone product.
Events in the game follow four years after "Fallout 3" and offer a similar role-playing experience, but no characters from that game appear.
The player assumes the role of a courier in the post-apocalyptic world of the Mojave Wasteland.
As the game begins, the Courier is shot in the head and left for dead shortly before being found and brought to a doctor in the nearby town of Goodsprings, marking the start of the game and the Courier's search for their would-be murderer.
The city of New Vegas is a post-apocalyptic interpretation of Las Vegas.
========,3,"Fallout 4" (2015).
"Fallout 4", developed by Bethesda Game Studios, was released on November 10, 2015.
On June 3, 2015 the game's official website went live revealing the game along with its box art, platforms, and the first trailer.
The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and takes place in Boston, Massachusetts, of the in-game New England Commonwealth and features voiced protagonists.
The Xbox One version has been confirmed to have mods as of 2016.
Bethesda also confirmed mods for PlayStation 4, after lengthy negotiations with Sony.
However, the PlayStation 4 mods are not able to utilize external files as of now.
"Fallout 4" takes place in the year 2287, ten years after the events of "Fallout 3".
"Fallout 4" s story begins on the day the bombs dropped: October 23, 2077.
The player's character (voiced by either Brian T. Delaney or Courtenay Taylor), dubbed as the Sole Survivor, takes shelter in Vault 111, emerging exactly 210 years later, after being subjected to suspended animation.
========,2,Spin-off games.
========,3,"Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel" (2001).
"Tactics" is the first "Fallout" game not to require the player to fight in a turn-based mode, and it is also the first to allow the player to customize the skills, perks, and combat actions of the rest of the party.
"Fallout Tactics" focuses on tactical combat rather than role-playing; the new combat system included different modes, stances, and modifiers, but the player had no dialogue options.
Most of the criticisms of the game came from its incompatibility with the story of the original two games, not from its gameplay.
"Fallout: Tactics" includes a multiplayer mode that allows players to compete against squads of other characters controlled by other players.
Unlike the previous two games, which are based in California, "Fallout: Tactics" takes place in the Midwestern United States.
The game was released in early 2001 to generally favorable reviews.
========,3,"Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel" (2004).
"Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel" became the first "Fallout" game for consoles when it was released in 2004.
It follows an initiate in the Brotherhood of Steel who is given a suicidal quest to find several lost Brotherhood Paladins.
"Brotherhood of Steel" is an action role-playing game, representing a significant break from previous incarnations of the "Fallout" series in both gameplay and aesthetics.
The game does not feature non-player characters that accompany the player in combat and uses heavy metal music, including Slipknot, Devin Townsend, and Killswitch Engage, which stands in contrast to the music of the earlier Fallout games, performed by The Ink Spots and Louis Armstrong.
It was the last "Fallout" game to be developed by Interplay.
========,3,"Fallout Shelter" (2015).
"Fallout Shelter" is a simulation game for Microsoft Windows, iOS, Android, and Xbox One.
The player acts as Overseer and must build and manage a Vault and its dwellers, including sending them into the Wasteland on scouting missions or defending the Vault from attack.
"Fallout Shelter" was first released for iOS on June 14, 2015, Android on August 13, 2015 and for PC on July 15, 2016.
On February 7, 2017 Bethesda launched "Fallout Shelter" on Xbox One.
========,2,Canceled games.
========,3,"Fallout Tactics 2".
"Fallout Tactics 2" was a proposed sequel to "", although it was originally conceived as a sequel to "Wasteland", the video game that inspired the "Fallout" series.
It was developed by Micro Forté, but the production was cancelled in December 2001 after the poor sales of "Fallout Tactics".
========,3,"Van Buren", Black Isle Studios' "Fallout 3".
"Van Buren" was the codename for the canceled version of "Fallout 3" developed by Black Isle Studios and published by Interplay Entertainment.
It featured an improved engine with real 3D graphics as opposed to sprites, new locations, vehicles, and a modified version of the SPECIAL system.
The story disconnected from the Vault Dweller/Chosen One bloodline in "Fallout" and "Fallout 2".
Plans for the game included the ability to influence the various factions.
The game was cancelled in December 2003 when the budget cuts forced Interplay to dismiss the PC development team.
Interplay subsequently sold the "Fallout" intellectual property to Bethesda Softworks, who began development on their own version of "Fallout 3" unrelated to "Van Buren".
Main parts of the game were incorporated into "Fallout 3" and its add-ons as well as "Fallout: New Vegas".
========,3,"Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel 2".
"Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel 2" is the canceled sequel to "Brotherhood of Steel".
The development of the game started before the completion of the original and its development caused the cancellation of "Van Buren".
Like its predecessor, the game would have used the Dark Alliance Engine.
It was targeted for a Christmas 2004 release date.
Like other Fallout games, the game would have used a reputation system, only simpler.
The game would have featured fourteen new weapons and ten new enemies.
Depending on whether the player is good or evil, the game would have played out differently.
Each of the four characters that were playable would have had a different fighting style, therefore each time the player played the game, they would have a different experience.
It would have had two player co-op action for players to experience the game with their friends.
The Dark Alliance Engine would have been fleshed out and player experience would have been refined.
A brand new sneak system would have been added to the game.
This system would have allowed players to stealthily follow enemies or use a sniper rifle on them.
For characters that could not use the sniper rifle, Interplay added a turret mode allowing those characters to use turrets.
========,3,"Fallout Online".
"Fallout Online" (previously known as "Project V13") was a cancelled project by Interplay and Masthead Studios to develop a "Fallout"-themed massively multiplayer online game.
It officially entered production in 2008.
In 2009, Bethesda filed a lawsuit against Interplay regarding "Project V13," claiming that Interplay has violated their agreement as development has not yet begun on the project.
On January 2, 2012, Bethesda and Interplay reached a settlement, the terms of which include the cancellation of Fallout Online and transfer of all rights in the franchise to Bethesda.
Since then, "Project V13" has been revived as a completely different project called Mayan Apocalypse, unrelated to "Fallout".
========,2,Series overview.
========,3,Setting.
The series is set in a fictionalized United States in an alternate history scenario that diverged from our reality following World War II.
The transistor was not invented, while vacuum tubes and atomic physics became the cornerstones to scientific progress, eventually achieving the technological aspirations of the early Atomic Age and locking society into a 1950s cultural stasis.
Thus, in this alternative atompunk "golden age", a bizarre socio-technological status quo emerges, in which advanced robots, nuclear-powered cars, directed-energy weapons, and other futuristic technologies are seen alongside 1950s-era computers and telephones.
The United States divides itself into 13 commonwealths and the aesthetics and Cold War paranoia of the 1950s continue to dominate the American lifestyle well into the 21st century, leading to America becoming a fascist police state and ultimately abandoning its democratic ideals in favor of a deeply corrupt plutocratic system and capitalism.
Political dissidents were sent to prison camps where they were experimented on, and anyone who spoke out against the Enclave-controlled government, be they citizens or occupied Canadians, were executed en masse in the streets.
More than a hundred years before the start of the series, an energy crisis emerged caused by the depletion of petroleum reserves, leading to a period called the "Resource Wars" – a series of events which included a war between the European Commonwealth and the Middle East, the disbanding of the United Nations, the U.S. invasion of Mexico, as well as the annexation of Canada, and a Chinese invasion and subsequent military occupation of Alaska coupled with their release of the "New Plague" that devastated the American mainland.
These eventually culminated in the "Great War" in the year 2077, a two-hour nuclear exchange on an apocalyptic scale, which subsequently created the post-apocalyptic United States, the setting of the "Fallout" world.
========,3,Vaults.
Having foreseen this outcome decades earlier, the U.S. government began a nationwide project in 2054 to build fallout shelters known as "Vaults".
The Vaults were ostensibly designed by the government contractor Vault-Tec as public shelters, financed by junk bonds and each able to support up to a thousand people.
Around 400,000 vaults would have been needed, but only 122 were commissioned and constructed.
Each Vault is self-sufficient, so they could theoretically sustain their inhabitants indefinitely.
However, the Vault project was never intended as a viable method of repopulating the United States in such a deadly scenario.
Instead, most Vaults were secret and unethical social experiments, and were designed to determine the effects of different environmental and psychological conditions on its inhabitants.
Experiments were widely varied and included: A Vault filled with clones of a single individual, one where the equipment designed to make clothing failed immediately after closing, a Vault where its residents were kept in cryo-stasis, a Vault where its residents were exposed to psychoactive drugs, one where one resident (usually the Vault's current Overseer) must be sacrificed each year, a Vault with only one man and puppets, a Vault where its inhabitants were segregated, two with extremely disproportionate ratios of men and women, one filled with compulsive gamblers who were only allowed to solve issues through gambling, a Vault where the inhabitants were exposed to the mutagenic Forced Evolutionary Virus (F.E.V.
), and a Vault where the door never closed, exposing the inhabitants to dangerous amounts of radiation.
A few control Vaults were made to function as advertised to contrast with the data from those Vaults with intentional flaws, but were usually shoddily made due to most of the funding going toward the experimental Vaults.
Nevertheless, many Vaults had their experiments derailed due to unexpected events.
Many of these Vaults were so self-destructive that by the time other survivors opened them, they were nothing but tombs.
========,3,Post-War conditions.
In the years following the Great War, the United States has devolved into a post-apocalyptic environment commonly dubbed "the Wasteland".
The War and subsequent nuclear Armageddon has severely depopulated the country, leaving large expanses of property decaying from neglect.
In addition, virtually all food and water is irradiated and most life have mutated due to high radiation combined with mutagens of varied origins.
With a large portion of the country's infrastructure in ruins, basic necessities are scarce.
Barter is the common method of exchange, with bottle caps providing a more conventional form of currency.
Most cities and towns are empty, having been looted and deserted in favor of smaller, makeshift communities scattered around the Wasteland.
Many humans who could not get into the Vaults survived the atomic blasts, but many of these, affected by the radiation, turned into so-called ghouls.
While they were given an extended lifespan, many lost their hair and their skin decayed.
Often, their voices became raspy, giving them a zombie-like appearance.
Ghouls have a hatred towards humans either through jealousy, or due to discrimination by humans.
Almost all ghouls resent their comparison to zombies and being called a zombie is viewed as a great insult by them.
Eventually, after being exposed to high levels of radiation, some ghouls become feral ghouls and attack almost everything on sight, having lost their mind.
========,3,Factions.
Although the Wastelands of the "Fallout" series are home to innumerable self-supporting groups, there are a number of factions who have a significant presence across the former United States.
These factions are often the major players in the larger events of each game's primary storyline.
In "Fallout: New Vegas" and "Fallout 4" the player's actions determine which factions emerge from the game's events victorious.
***LIST***.
========,3,Influences.
"Fallout" draws from 1950s pulp magazine science fiction and superhero comic books, all rooted in Atomic Age optimism of a nuclear-powered future, though gone terribly awry by the time the events of the game take place.
The technology is retro-futuristic, with various Raygun Gothic machines such as laser weaponry and boxy "Forbidden Planet"-style robots.
Computers use vacuum tubes instead of transistors, architecture of ruined buildings feature Art Deco and Googie designs, energy weapons resemble those used by Flash Gordon, and what few vehicles remain in the world are all 1950s-styled.
"Fallout"'s other production design, such as menu interfaces, are similarly designed to resemble advertisements and toys of the Atomic Age.
Advertising in the game such as billboards and brochures has a distinct 1950s motif and feel.
The lack of retro-stylization was a common reason for criticism in spin-off games.
A major influence was "A Boy and His Dog", where the main character Vic and his dog Blood scavenge the desert of the Southwestern United States, stealing for a living and evading bands of marauders, berserk androids, and mutants.
It "inspired "Fallout" on many levels, from underground communities of survivors to glowing mutants."
Other film influences include the "Mad Max" series, with its depiction of a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
In the first game, one of the first available armors is a one-sleeved leather jacket that resembles the jacket worn by Mel Gibson in "".
========,2,Gameplay.
========,3,SPECIAL.
SPECIAL is a character creation and statistics system developed specifically for the "Fallout" series.
SPECIAL is an acronym, representing the seven attributes used to define "Fallout" characters: Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck.
SPECIAL is heavily based on GURPS, which was originally intended to be the character system used in the game.
The SPECIAL system involves the following sets of key features:
***LIST***.
The SPECIAL system has thus far been used in the role-playing video game "Fallout", "Fallout 2" and '.
A heavily modified version of the system was used for "Fallout 3", ' and "", a tabletop battle game available on the "Fallout Tactics" bonus CD.
"Fallout Shelter", the first mobile game in the series, also uses a form of SPECIAL.
Aside from "Fallout" games, modified versions of SPECIAL were also used in "" (also referred to as "Fallout Fantasy" early in production), a fantasy role-playing video game that involved spirits and magic in addition to the traditional SPECIAL features, as well as the cancelled project "Black Isle's Torn".
========,3,The Pip-Boy and Vault Boy.
The Pip-Boy (Personal Information Processor-Boy) is a wrist-computer given to the player early in "Fallout", "Fallout 2", "Fallout 3", "Fallout: New Vegas" and "Fallout 4" which serves various roles in quest, inventory, and battle management, as well as presenting player statistics.
The model present in "Fallout" and "Fallout 2" is identified as a Pip-Boy 2000, and both games feature the very same unit, used first by the Vault Dweller and later inherited by the Chosen One.
"Fallout Tactics" contains a modified version of the 2000 model, called Pip-Boy 2000BE, while "Fallout 3" and "Fallout: New Vegas" uses a Pip-Boy 3000.
"Fallout: New Vegas" also has a golden version of it, called the Pimp-Boy 3Billion that is given to the player as a reward for completing a quest in a certain way.
"Fallout 4" contains a modified version of the 3000, called the Pip-Boy 3000 Mark IV.
The Vault Boy character is Vault-Tec's mascot, and is a frequently recurring element in Vault-Tec-related items in the world.
This includes the Pip-Boy, where Vault Boy illustrates all of the character statistics and selectable attributes.
From Bethesda's "Fallout 3" onward Vault Boy models all of the clothing and weaponry as well.
The character was originally designed by Leonard Boyarsky, based partly on Rich Uncle Pennybags from the "Monopoly" board game, and then drawn for "Fallout" by George Almond for the first few cards and then by Tramell Ray Isaac, who finalized the look of the character.
========,2,Tabletop games.
========,3,"Fallout: Warfare".
"Fallout: Warfare" is a tabletop wargame based on the "Fallout Tactics" storyline, using a simplified version of the SPECIAL system.
The rulebook was written by Christopher Taylor, and was available on the "Fallout Tactics" bonus CD, together with cut-out miniatures.
"Fallout: Warfare" features five distinct factions, vehicles, four game types and 33 different units.
The rules only require ten-sided dice.
The modifications to the SPECIAL system allow every unit a unique set of stats and give special units certain skills they can use, including piloting, doctor, and repair.
A section of the "Fallout: Warfare" manual allows campaigns to be conducted using the "Warfare" rules.
The game is currently available for free online from fansite No Mutants Allowed and several other sources.
It has also been chosen for many awards and won game of the year.
========,3,"Exodus".
"Exodus" is a role-playing game published by Glutton Creeper Games using the d20 Modern/OGL system.
At the beginning of the development this game was known as "Fallout: Pen and Paper - d20" however all connections to "Fallout" were dropped after a legal dispute with Bethesda.
========,2,Film adaptation.
In 1998, Interplay Entertainment founded the film division Interplay Films to make films based on its properties, and announced that a "Fallout" movie was one of their first projects, along film adaptations of "Descent" and "Redneck Rampage".
In 2000, Interplay confirmed that a movie based on the original "Fallout" game was in production with "" screenwriter Brent V. Friedman attached to write a film treatment and with Dark Horse Entertainment attached to produce it.
However, the division was later disbanded without any film produced, but Friedman's treatment was leaked on the Internet in 2011.
In 2009, Bethesda Softworks expressed its interest in producing a "Fallout" movie.
Following four extensions of the trademark without any use, Bethesda filed a "Statement of Use" with the USPTO in January 2012.
In February 2012, instead of a "Fallout" film, a special feature was made, entitled "Making of Fallout 3 DVD", which was accepted as a movie on March 27 of the same year.
This action removed the requirement to continue to re-register that mark indefinitely.
In the DVD commentary of "Mutant Chronicles", voice actor Ron Perlman stated that if a "Fallout" movie was made, he would like to reprise his role as the Narrator from "Fallout 3".
In 2016, Todd Howard stated that Bethesda had turned down the offers of making a film based on "Fallout", but that he did not rule out the possibility.
========,2,Legal action.
Interplay was threatened with bankruptcy and sold the full "Fallout" franchise to Bethesda, but kept the rights to the "Fallout" MMO through a back license in April 2007 and began work on the MMO later that year.
Bethesda Softworks sued Interplay Entertainment for copyright infringement on September 8, 2009, regarding the "Fallout Online" license and selling of "Fallout Trilogy" and sought an injunction to stop development of "Fallout Online" and sales of "Fallout Trilogy".
Key points that Bethesda were trying to argue is that Interplay did not have the right to sell "Fallout Trilogy" on the Internet via Steam, Good Old Games or other online services.
Bethesda also said that "full scale" development on "Fallout Online" was not met and that the minimum financing of 30 million of "secured funding" was not met.
Interplay launched a counter suit claiming that Bethesda's claims were meritless and that it did have the right to sell "Fallout" Trilogy via online stores via its contract with Bethesda.
Interplay also claimed secure funding had been met and the game was in full scale development by the cut off date.
Interplay argued to have the second contract that sold "Fallout" voided which would result in the first contract that licensed "Fallout" to come back into effect.
This would mean that "Fallout" would revert to Interplay.
Bethesda would be allowed to make "Fallout 5".
Bethesda would also have to pay 12% of royalties on "Fallout 3", "Fallout: New Vegas", "Fallout 4" and expansions plus interest on the money owed.
On December 10, 2009, Bethesda lost the first injunction.
Bethesda shortly afterward tried a new tactic and fired its first lawyer, replacing him and filing a second injunction, claiming that Interplay had only back licensed the name "Fallout" but no content.
Interplay has countered showing that the contract states that they must make "Fallout Online" that has the look and feel of "Fallout" and that in the event Interplay fails to meet the requirements (30 million minimum secure funding and "full scale" development by X date) that Interplay can still release the MMO but they have to remove all "Fallout" content.
The contract then goes on to list all "Fallout" content as locations, monsters, settings and lore.
Bethesda has known that Interplay would use "Fallout" elements via internet emails shown in court documents and that the contract was not just for the name.
The second injunction by Bethesda was denied on August 4, 2011 by the courts.
Bethesda then appealed the denial of their second preliminary injunction.
Bethesda then sued Masthead Studios and asked for a restraining order against the company.
Bethesda was denied this restraining order before Masthead Studios could call a counter-suit.
Bethesda then lost its appeal of the second injunction.
Bethesda then filed motion in limine against Interplay.
Interplay then filed a motion in limine against Bethesda the day after.
Shortly after, the trial by jury which Bethesda requested on October 26, 2010 was changed to a trial by court because the APA contract (aka the second contract that sold "Fallout" to Bethesda) stated that all legal matters would be resolved via a trial by court and not a trial by jury.
The trial by court began on December 12.
In 2012, in a press conference Bethesda revealed that in exchange for 2 million dollars, Interplay gave to them full rights for "Fallout Online".
Interplay's rights to sell and merchandise "Fallout", "Fallout 2" and "Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel" expired on December 31, 2013.
========,2,Reception and legacy.
The "Fallout" series has been met with positive reception.
The highest rated title is "Fallout 3" according to review aggregator Metacritic.
========,3,Controversy and fandom.
Not all fans are happy with the direction the "Fallout" series has taken since its acquisition by Bethesda Softworks.
Notorious for their vitriolic support of the series' first two games, "Fallout" and "Fallout 2", members centered around one of the oldest "Fallout" fansites, "No Mutants Allowed", have cried foul over departures from the original games' stories, gameplay mechanics and setting.
Minor criticisms include the prevalence of unspoiled food after 200 years, the survival of wood-framed dwellings following a nuclear blast, and the ubiquity of Super Mutants at early levels in the game.
More serious criticisms involve the quality of the game's writing, a perceived lack of verisimilitude, the switch to a first-person action game format, and the reactiveness of the surrounding game world to player actions.
In response, Jim Sterling of "Destructoid" has called fan groups like "No Mutants Allowed" "selfish" and "arrogant"; stating that a new audience deserves a chance to play a "Fallout" game; and that if the series had stayed the way it was back in 1997, new titles would never have been made and brought to market.
Luke Winkie of "Kotaku" tempers these sentiments, saying that it is a matter of "ownership"; and that in the case of "Fallout 3", hardcore fans of the original series witnessed their favorite games become transformed into something else and that they are "not wrong" for having grievances.
