Tyronza is one of the oldest cities within Poinsett County with its origins dating back to the late 19th century.
In the 1930s, it was the site where the Southern Tenant Farmers movement started what became a national outcry against the abusive discrimination by wealthy land owners against sharecroppers who were mostly African-American farmers.
There is now a museum in the city run by Arkansas State University highlighting the history of the movement and the history of the region.
Tyronza was also the home of Dr. L. H. McDaniel, a local physician who became friends with President Lyndon Baines Johnson through his political involvement in the Democratic Party.
McDaniel was a close advisor to Johnson and U.S. House Ways and Means Chairman Wilbur D. Mills (D-Arkansas) in the creation of the Medicare and Medicaid programs which began in 1965, the year McDaniel died.
He treated patients all over eastern Arkansas regardless of their ability to pay and often accepted live chickens, baked goods and garden vegetables as payment for his home visits.
McDaniel was a national delegate to Democratic Conventions in the 1950s and brought national political and medical leaders to Tyronza with conferences he set up in huge 1,000-seat tents on the outskirts of the city.
Although the community started as a farming and retail center it has become a bedroom community for many of its residents who work in Jonesboro or Memphis but who prefer the small town lifestyle.
