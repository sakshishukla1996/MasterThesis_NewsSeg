The urban sprawl of South Sacramento began with the major road of Stockton Boulevard that goes through the area.
Stockton Boulevard and Franklin Boulevard extend southerly from Downtown Sacramento and were used from the earliest days of the "gold mining" era for land routes to Stockton as well as to travel to farming areas.
The next transportation growth was the Southern Pacific Railroad and then several years after, the Western Pacific Railroad who both built railroad tracks in neighboring Florin.
During the 1940s, steady growth of residential areas was occurring in neighboring areas of South Sacramento.
During the 1950s additional shopping centers were developed on or near Stockton Boulevard and Florin Road and new residential areas developed in the nearby Lindale and Florin areas.
Rapid growth occurred in the early 1960s as the Florin Mall was built in South Sacramento as well as additions to the Lindale area, tapering off in the late '60s to early '70s.
