========,2,Piper v Big Pine (1924) 193 Cal 664.
Alice Piper, a 15-year-old Native American living in Big Pine in 1923, wanted to attend Big Pine school, but was denied on her ethnicity.
Piper, the daughter of Pike and Annie Piper, sued the school district claiming the state law establishing separate schools for “Indian children” and other children of Asian parentage was unconstitutional.
The State Supreme Court ruled unanimously that because Alice Piper's father was a tax-paying citizen, that Alice Piper therefore qualified as a citizen under the Dawes Act.
The court did not, in fact, find that her 14th Amendment rights had been violated.
Nonetheless, Alice Piper was invited as a pupil and her victory along with the passage the "Indian Citizenship Act", on the same day opened the door for herself and other Native American children to attend public schools in the state of California.
Because of this, the Big Pine School District is memorialized as a major player in the constitutional battle over the rights of Native Americans to attend public schools segregated for “whites only.”
The Piper case has become a landmark case and is viewed as the legal authority guaranteeing Native American children the right to attend public schools.
It has been used as precedence in other cases such as Brown v. Board of Education.
========,2,Norman Clyde.
Norman Clyde (April 8, 1885 – December 23, 1972) was a famous mountaineer, nature photographer, and self trained naturalist.
He is well known for achieving over 100 first ascents, many in California's Sierra Nevada and Montana.
He also set a speed climbing record on Mount Shasta in 1923.
In the 1950s and 1960s, he lived by himself at the old Baker ranch-house on Baker Creek near Big Pine.
He also served as a caretaker of Glacier Lodge on Big Pine Creek and a fishing cabin owned by Lon Chaney Sr. in the Palisades above Big Pine.
Clyde was born in Philadelphia, the son of a Presbyterian minister.
He attended Geneva College graduating in the Classics in June 1909.
After teaching at several rural schools, including Fargo, North Dakota and Mount Pleasant, Utah, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley in 1911.
After two years of graduate work he returned to teaching, mostly in northern California.
On June 15, 1915, Norman Clyde married Winifred May Bolster in Pasadena, California.
Winnie was a nurse at a tuberculosis hospital, and contracted the disease herself.
After 4 years of suffering she died at age 28 in 1919.
His wife's death appears to have profoundly affected him as he moved to the Eastern Sierra to spend much of his latter life alone.
Clyde spent many summers traveling about in the Sierra Nevada, bagging first ascents.
He served as climbing leader at Sierra Club base camps where he became known as "the pack that walks like a man" because of the huge backpacks he carried.
In addition to as many as five cameras, he carried a hammer and cobbler's anvil in order to make field repairs to client's boots.
