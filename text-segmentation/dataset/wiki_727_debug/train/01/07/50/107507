========,2,History.
The Timbisha Native Americans inhabited what is now known as the Furnace Creek oasis for centuries.
Greenland Ranch was established by the William Tell Coleman Borax Company in 1883.
It was named after the green Alfalfa fields planted at the location.
A Weather Station was established at the ranch in 1891.
Greenland Ranch was renamed Furnace Creek Ranch in 1933.
The Timbisha tribe currently live at their Death Valley Indian Community reservation here.
The Timbisha people provided many of the artisans and builders to construct the original Fred Harvey Company resort buildings, the Indian Village, and Park Service structures.
They were one of the first tribes to secure tribal status through the Bureau of Indian Affairs' Federal Acknowledgment Process.
In present times, as the federally recognized Death Valley Timbisha Shoshone Band of California, they are the majority residents of Furnace Creek's permanent population at the tribe's reservation, the 'Death Valley Indian Community.'
Furnace Creek was formerly the center of Death Valley mining and operations for the Pacific Coast Borax Company and the historic 20 Mule Teams hauling wagon trains of borax across the Mojave Desert.
On the afternoon of July 10, 1913, a temperature of 134 °F (56.7 °C) was recorded at Greenland Ranch.
This temperature stands as the highest ambient air temperature ever recorded at the surface of the Earth.
(A report of a temperature of 58 °C (136.4 °F) recorded in Libya in 1922 was later determined to be inaccurate.)
