========,2,History.
========,3,Before the Spanish Empire.
Prior to the arrival of the Spanish in Alta California, the area that is now Downey was inhabited by the Tongva ethnic group, which came to be called the Gabrielino by the Spanish.
The nearest Tongva settlements appear to have been just north and northeast of present-day Downey, although there is difficulty in locating them precisely.
The villages of "Naxaaw’nga" and "Sehat" seem to have been situated near the present-day community of Los Nietos, or perhaps farther west on sites that were lost to floods of the San Gabriel River.
"Chokiishnga" and "Huutnga" are other Tongva place names that may have referred to villages in the general area north of Downey between the San Gabriel River and Rio Hondo.
In all four cases, it is difficult to relate the original location descriptions, based on ranchos and land grants, to more specific sites identifiable by today's landmarks.
========,3,18th century until World War II.
Mission San Gabriel Arcángel was initially founded on September 8, 1771, near these concentrations of Tongva population, at a site in the Whittier Narrows on a bluff overlooking the Rio Hondo near the intersection of today's San Gabriel Blvd and Lincoln Avenue.
After five years, flooding forced the relocation of the mission to its present site in San Gabriel.
In 1784, Governor Pedro Fages granted to former soldier Manuel Nieto (1734–1804) the largest of the land concessions made during the Spanish control of California.
Its stretched from the Santa Ana River on the east to the Old San Gabriel River (now the Rio Hondo and Los Angeles River) on the west, and from the mission highway (approximately Whittier Boulevard) on the north to the ocean on the south.
Its acreage was slightly reduced later at the insistence of Mission San Gabriel on whose lands it infringed.
The Spanish concessions, of which 25 were made in California, were unlike the later Mexican land grants in that title was not transferred, but were similar to grazing permits, with the title remaining with the Spanish crown.
The Rancho Los Nietos passed to Manuel Nieto's four children upon his death and remained intact until, in 1833, his heirs petitioned Mexican Governor José Figueroa to partition the property.
The northwestern portion of the original rancho, comprising the Downey-Norwalk area, was granted as Rancho Santa Gertrudes to Josefa Cota, the widow of Manuel's son, Antonio Nieto.
At approximately , Santa Gertrudes was itself a sizable rancho and contained the old Nietos homestead, which was a center of social life east of the pueblo of Los Angeles.
After the Mexican–American War concluded in 1848, many of the Californio ranchos were obtained by affluent Anglo-Americans who were immigrating west under the United States manifest destiny doctrine, and marrying into established Californio Spanish families.
This migration was distinct from that prompted by the California Gold Rush farther north.
Dairy was a major industry in Downey.
The Central Milk Agency marketed the milk for "seven hundred dairymen whose dairy herds range from thirty to two thousand head" with the value of the products marketed in excess of $1,000,000 per month.
Some of Downey's settlers came from Ireland.
Downey was founded by and named for the former and youngest ever governor of California, John Gately Downey, who was born in Ireland.
Although he was an Irish Democrat, he supported the Republican Lincoln in his efforts to keep the Union intact during the American Civil War.
He pioneered the modern subdivision with land he acquired between the Rio Hondo and the San Gabriel River, in about 1865.
Downey was convinced that oranges would flourish in Southern California, so he imported several varieties, and therefore set in motion what became one of the state's biggest cash crops.
In conjunction with the construction of the Tehachapi Loop, the Southern Pacific Railroad arrived in 1873.
========,3,After World War II.
Farmers in the area grew grain, corn, castor beans and fruit, and by 1935 Downey was characterized as an "orange-grove town".
Downey was incorporated in 1956, and instituted a charter form of government in 1964.
Suburban homes and factories replaced the farms after World War II.

Vultee Aircraft was Downey's largest employer during World War II, producing 15% of all of America's military aircraft by 1941.
The company was a pioneer in the use of women in manufacturing positions, and was the first aircraft company to build airplanes on a powered assembly line.
Vultee became a part of North American Aviation, (later North American Rockwell, then Rockwell International which was then bought by the Boeing company) whose facilities were the birthplace of the systems for the Apollo Space Program as well as the Space Shuttle.
For over 70 years, Downey's Rockwell NASA plant produced and tested many of the 20th century's greatest aviation, missile, and space endeavors.
By the early 1970s, the facilities encompassed some of enclosed area over more than .
But, by the post-Cold War 1990s, Downey was brutally hit by cutbacks in the defense budget.
Rockwell International, who once had over 30,000 employees, had less than 5,000 in 1992.
The seventy-year history of airplane and space vehicle manufacturing in Downey came to an end when the Rockwell plant closed in 1999.
The former North American Rockwell plant was demolished, and the site now features the Columbia Memorial Space Center, Downey Landing shopping center, a Kaiser Permanente hospital, a city recreation fields park, and the former movie studio site of Downey Studios.

Near the center of the city lies what was the 1960s the busiest intersections in California, the intersection of Lakewood Boulevard (State Route 19) and Firestone Boulevard (former State Route 42).

It was the second restaurant franchised by Richard and Maurice McDonald, prior to the involvement of Ray Kroc in the company, and it still has the two original "Golden arches" and a animated neon "Speedee" sign.
With low sales, the lack of a drive-up window and indoor seating, and with severe damage from the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the restaurant was forced to close.
However, with both the public and preservationists demanding the restaurant be saved, McDonald's spent two years restoring the restaurant and reopened it.

========,2,Downey in the News.
========,3,The Ban on Tarzan Books.
In the early 1960s it was widely reported that the Downey City Library had banned all of Edgar Rice Burroughs' "Tarzan" books because Tarzan wasn't married to Jane when they conceived Boy.
This rumor was widely believed.
Evidence for the staying power of this rumor is in articles in the Los Angeles Times that were published in the 1970s.
In May 8, 1970, the popular Los Angeles Times columnist Jack Smith wrote "Downey Sends L.A. Back to the Bush League," in which he stated, "Wasn't it Downey, a few years ago, that tried to get the Tarzan books out of the town library on the grounds that Tarzan and Jane were living together but weren't married?
Yes, it was Downey."
Ray Loynd's September 8, 1971 Los Angeles Times article, "Stage Review: Downey Guild Offers 'Evening of Theater'" (see p. H9) called Downey "a community that is capable of banning Tarzan from the public library."
The rumor about Tarzan was, however, a wild exaggeration of what actually happened.
According to "Zane Grey Also Safe: Tarzan's Marital Status No Issue as Downey School Ban Is Denied," an article from the Los Angeles Times that appeared on pages B1 and B11 on Dec. 28, 1961, a rumor spread that one of the Downey elementary schools had removed Edgar Rice Burroughs and Zane Grey books from its library because "1—There was no indication that Tarzan and his mate, Jane, were ever married before they took up housekeeping in the treetops," and "2—Grey was known to put such expletives as 'damn!'
and 'hell' in the mouths of his western cowhands."
In a later article, ("Downey Furor Result: Schools Take Over Control of Libraries.
Los Angeles Times, Jan. 6 1962, p. B1) the Times explained that the Superintendent of the Downey Unified School District heard this rumor and investigated the situation to find out what happened.
He discovered that there was no "ban."
What had happened was that in one elementary school, a parent had put two Zane Grey books "out of site in a desk drawer."
No Tarzan books were involved.
The Zane Grey books were subsequently put back on the shelves.
========,2,Crime.
While reports of robberies, aggravated assaults and petty thefts in Downey dropped in 2008, auto thefts reached a 10-year high.

========,3,Anti-gang activities.
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Downey saw an increase in gang activity.
Today there is still gang activity going in the south area of Downey.
In response, Downey formed GOOD (Gangs Out Of Downey), a community-based organization that helps encourage young people between the ages of 10-20 to stay away from gangs.
GOOD is also responsible for organizing many community events and programs such as various sports, after school care, scholarship programs for at-risk students looking to attend college, and counseling for both young people and their parents.
