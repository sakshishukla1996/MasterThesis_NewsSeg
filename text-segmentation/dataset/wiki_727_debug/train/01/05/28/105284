The name Tuntutuliak in the Yup'ik language means "the land of many caribou."
The first settlers of the village moved to Tuntutuliak from an old village site called Qinaq.
What is left of the old village is nothing but graves, and maybe a bear home at the end of the river called "Avcuamciq" which divided Qinaq in half.
The governing body of the village is called the Tuntutuliak Tribal Council.
The Council is also divided into several other smaller companies.
Those companies are the Environmental Protection Agency, the local police department(VPOs-Village Police Officers, VPSOs-Village Public Safety Officers), and the health clinic.
