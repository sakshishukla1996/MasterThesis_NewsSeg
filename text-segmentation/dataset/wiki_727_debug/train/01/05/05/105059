========,1,preface.
Anhui (; ) is a landlocked province of the People's Republic of China located in the eastern region of the country.
Located across the basins of the Yangtze River and the Huai River, it borders Jiangsu to the east, Zhejiang to the southeast, Jiangxi to the south, Hubei to the southwest, Henan to the northwest, and Shandong for a short section in the north.
The provincial capital is Hefei.
The name "Anhui" derives from the names of two cities: Anqing and Huizhou (now Huangshan City).
The abbreviation for Anhui is "" after the historical State of Wan, Mount Wan, and the Wan river.
========,2,History.
The province of Anhui was formed in the 17th century.
Before then, there was no coherent concept of "Anhui".
In terms of culture, Northern Anhui was firmly a part of the North China Plain together with modern-day Henan province, northern Jiangsu and southern Shandong provinces.
Central Anhui was densely populated and constituted mostly of fertile land from the Huai River watershed.
In contrast, the culture of Southern Anhui, bordered mostly along the Yangtze, was closer to Jiangxi and southern Jiangsu provinces.
The hills of southeastern Anhui formed a unique and distinct cultural sphere of its own.
In the 2007 book "China Road", author Rob Gifford stated that the Chinese refer to Anhui as a "big agricultural province" (农业大省).
According to Gifford, this is an euphemism for a "very poor" area and that people have referred to Anhui as the "Appalachia of China".
========,2,Geography.
Anhui is quite diverse topographically.
The north of the province is part of the North China Plain while the north-central areas are part of the Huai River watershed.
Both of these regions are very flat and densely populated.
The land becomes more uneven further south, with the Dabie Mountains occupying much of southwestern Anhui and a series of hills and ranges cutting through southeastern Anhui.
The Yangtze River finds its way through south Anhui in between these two mountainous regions.
The highest peak in Anhui is Lotus Peak, part of Huangshan in southeastern Anhui.
It has an altitude of 1873 m. Major rivers include the Huai River in the north and the Yangtze in the south.
The largest lake is Lake Chaohu situated in the center of the province, with an area of about .
The southeastern part of the province near the Yangtze River has many lakes as well.
As with topography, the province differs in climate from north to south.
The north is more temperate and has more clearcut seasons.
January temperatures average at around -1 to 2 °C north of the Huai River, and 0 to 3 °C south of the Huai River; in July temperatures average 27 °C or above.
Plum rains occur in June and July and may cause flooding.
Major cities:
========,2,Administrative divisions.
Anhui is divided into sixteen prefecture-level divisions: all prefecture-level cities:
The sixteen prefecture-level divisions of Anhui are subdivided into 105 county-level divisions (44 districts, 6 county-level cities, and 55 counties).
Those are in turn divided into 1,845 township-level divisions (972 towns, 634 townships, nine ethnic townships, and 230 subdistricts).
========,2,Politics.
The Politics of Anhui Province is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China.
The Governor of Anhui () is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Anhui.
However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Anhui Communist Party of China Provincial Committee Secretary (), colloquially termed the "Anhui Party Chief".
========,2,Economy.
Agriculture in Anhui varies according to the climate zones that the province crosses.
To the north of the Huai River, wheat and sweet potatoes are grown, while to the south of the Huai River it is rice and wheat instead.
Natural resources of Anhui include iron in Ma'anshan, coal in Huainan, and copper in Tongling.
There are industries related to these natural resources (e.g.
steel industry at Ma'anshan).
One of the famous Anhui-based corporations is the automobile company Chery, which is based in Wuhu.
Compared to its more prosperous neighbours to the east, Zhejiang and Jiangsu, Anhui has lagged markedly behind in economic development, with a GDP per capita around one third the level of those two provinces.
There is great regional disparity as well, and most of the wealth is concentrated in industrial regions close to the Yangtze River, such as Hefei, Wuhu, and Ma'anshan.
Anhui's nominal GDP for 2011 was approximately 1.51 trillion yuan (US$239.8 billion), up 12.9% from 2008 and a per capita of 16,391 yuan (US$2,400).
It is considered a mid-size economy in terms of economic output.
Anhui's GDP is largely driven by fixed-asset investment, and the province's GDP to FAI ratio as of 2009 was 0.89, the highest in China.
Anhui's largest companies include Anhui Conch Cement Company, a producer and distributor of cement, Guoyang Securities Co (SHE: 000728), a financial services provider, and Ma’anshan Iron & Steel, a producer of steel and iron.

Bengbu dialect) are classified as Zhongyuan Mandarin, together with dialects in provinces such as Henan and Shandong; dialects in the central parts (e.g.
Hefei dialect) are classified as Jianghuai Mandarin, together with dialects in the central parts of neighbouring Jiangsu province.
