========,2,History and culture.
Wood River and Aleknagik Lake have been used historically as summer fish camps.
The spelling of the Yupik word "Aleknagik" has been disputed, because Yupik was an unwritten language.
The name was described by the resident Yako family in 1930 as meaning "Wrong Way Home", because Nushagak River residents returning to their homes upriver would sometimes become lost in the fog and find themselves swept up the Wood River with the tide, inadvertently arriving at Aleknagik Lake.
Recorded history may not define the exact place of Aleknagik, and various reports have reported the original site with the name "Alaqnaqiq" as far to the south near entrance to the Wood River.
James Van Stone, an anthropologist who traveled to Saint Petersburg and read diaries of the Russian explorers from 1867, noted that explorers traveled to "Aleknagik Lake" (in a spelling that is Russian but sounds out to Aleknagik).
In 2005, the Alaska Department of Natural Resources applied to own the waterways and compiled an extensive history of the area in their application (see Links below).
The 1929 U.S. Census found 55 people living in the "Wood River village" area to the south.
During 1930, there were five families living on the shores of the lake year-round, the Waskeys, Polleys, Hansons, Yakos, and Smiths.
A log cabin territorial school was built on the south shore of the lake in 1933, and Josie Waskey was the first teacher.
Attracted by the school, other facilities, and plentiful fish, game and timber, a number of families from the Goodnews, Togiak, and Kulukak areas relocated to Aleknagik.
A post office was established in 1937.
A two-story framed school with a teacher apartment was constructed in 1938.

The city was incorporated in 1973.
Over 24 additional square miles were annexed to the city in April 2000.
