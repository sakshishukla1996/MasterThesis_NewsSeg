========,2,History.
========,3,Early years.
Anderson is named after Arthur Anderson, one of several homesteaders who settled in the area in the late 1950s.
In 1959, Anderson subdivided his homestead into house lots and sold most of the lots to civilian workers from Clear Air Force Station, a Ballistic Missile Early Warning System station completed in 1961.
An elementary school was built in the community in 1961, and Anderson incorporated as a city on June 2, 1962.
In the 1960s, a road was completed between Anderson and Nenana.
A ferry across the Tanana River at Nenana provided access to the Fairbanks–Nenana Highway, and hence to Fairbanks and the contiguous North American highway system via the Richardson and Alaska Highways.
The ferry was replaced with a bridge in 1968.
In 1972, the George Parks Highway was completed, which provided direct road access to points south, including Anchorage.
========,3,21st century.
In March 2007, the city announced a plan to attract more residents: the awarding of free land to interested applicants.
This concept has been compared to that of the Homestead Act.
The Anderson/Clear Lions Club, in conjunction with commercial sponsors and Two Rivers-based concert promoters Acoustic Adventures, hosted the annual Anderson Bluegrass Festival.
Held on the last weekend of every July from Friday through Sunday at Riverside Park, the festival was the city's significant visitor attraction.
The festival was discontinued after the 2012 edition and replaced with a similar privately ran Family music festival held in the same location starting in 2015.
