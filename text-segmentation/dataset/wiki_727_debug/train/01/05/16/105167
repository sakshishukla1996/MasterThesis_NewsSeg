========,1,preface.
Tuscaloosa ( ) is a city in and the seat of Tuscaloosa County in west central Alabama (in the southeastern United States).
Located on the Black Warrior River at the Atlantic Seaboard fall line of the Piedmont, it is the fifth-largest city in Alabama, with an estimated population of 99,543 in 2016.
Incorporated as a town on December 13, 1819, it was named after Tuskaloosa, the chieftain of a Muskogean-speaking people who battled and was defeated by forces of Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto in 1540 in the Battle of Mabila.
It served as Alabama's capital city from 1826 to 1846.
Tuscaloosa is the regional center of industry, commerce, healthcare, and education for the area of west-central Alabama known as "West Alabama".
It is the principal city of the Tuscaloosa Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes Tuscaloosa, Hale and Pickens counties and has an estimated metro population in 2013 of 235,628.
Tuscaloosa is also the home of The University of Alabama, Stillman College and Shelton State Community College.
While the city attracted international attention when Mercedes-Benz announced it would build its first automotive assembly plant in North America in Tuscaloosa County, the University of Alabama remains the dominant economic and cultural engine in the city.
Tuscaloosa has been traditionally known as the "Druid City" because of the numerous water oaks planted in its downtown streets since the 1840s.
The city has also become known nationally for the University of Alabama's success in sports, and particularly in football.
City leaders adopted the moniker "The City of Champions" after the Alabama Crimson Tide football team won the BCS National Championship in their 2009, 2011, and again in their 2012 seasons.
The Tide won the College Football Playoff in the 2015 season.
In 2008, the City of Tuscaloosa hosted the USA Olympic Triathlon trials for the Beijing Games.
In recent years, Tuscaloosa has been named the "Most Livable City in America," one of Americas "100 Best Communities for Young People," one of the "50 Best College Towns," and one of the "Best Places to Launch a Small Business."
========,2,History.
========,3,Native American.
Nearly 12,000 years ago, Native Americans or Paleo-Indians arrived in what today is referred to as the Deep South.
They were hunter-gatherers who pursued the megafauna that became extinct following the end of the Pleistocene age.
After thousands of years, successive indigenous cultures developed a rich and complex agricultural society.
Archaeologists called these people the Mississippians of the Mississippian culture; they were Mound Builders.
Their large earthworks, built for political and religious rituals roughly from 900AD to 1500AD, expressed their cosmology.
Their earthwork mounds and great plazas survive throughout the valleys of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, as well as their tributaries in the Southeast.
Descendant Native American tribes include the Creek (( Muskogee people).
Also among the historical tribes living in the area of present-day Alabama at the time of European contact were the Iroquoian-speaking Cherokee in the interior, believed to have migrated south centuries before from the Great Lakes area.
The tribes of the coastal plain and Piedmont included the Muskogean-speaking Alabama ("Alibamu"), Chickasaw, Choctaw, Koasati, and Mobile.
In 1828, Andrew Jackson was elected president of the United States.
He had gained popularity when he defeated the Creek at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814, following victories in the War of 1812.
He long proposed Indian removal to the Indian Territory west of the Mississippi, to make land available for European-American settlement.
Jackson abandoned the policy of his predecessors of treating different Indian groups as separate nations.
Instead, he aggressively pursued plans to move all Indian tribes living east of the Mississippi River.
Following the Indian Removal Act, in 1832 the Creek National Council signed the Treaty of Cusseta, ceding their remaining lands east of the Mississippi to the U.S., and accepting relocation to the Indian Territory.
Most Muscogee-speaking peoples were removed to Indian Territory during the Trail of Tears in 1834, although some remained behind.
Some Muscogee in Alabama live near Poarch Creek Reservation in Atmore (northeast of Mobile).
========,3,Statehood.
The pace of white settlement in the Southeast increased greatly after the War of 1812 and the Treaty of Fort Jackson.
A small assortment of log cabins soon arose near the large Creek village at the fall line of the river, which the new settlers named in honor of the sixteenth-century Chief Tuskaloosa of a Muskogean-speaking tribe.
In 1817, Alabama became a territory, and on December 13, 1819, the territorial legislature incorporated the town of Tuscaloosa, one day before Congress admitted Alabama to the Union as a state.
From 1826 to 1846, Tuscaloosa was the capital of Alabama.
During this period, in 1831, the University of Alabama was established.
The town's population and economy grew rapidly until the departure of the capital to Montgomery caused a rapid decline in population.
Establishment of the Bryce State Hospital for the Insane in Tuscaloosa in the 1850s helped restore the city's fortunes.
========,3,Civil War.
During the Civil War following Alabama's secession from the Union, several thousand men from Tuscaloosa fought in the Confederate armies.
During the last weeks of the War, a brigade of Union troops raiding the city burned the campus of the university.
The larger town was also damaged in the battle and shared fully in the South's economic sufferings which followed the defeat.
In the 1890s the construction of a system of locks and dams on the Black Warrior River by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers opened up an inexpensive link to the Gulf seaport of Mobile, stimulating especially the mining and metallurgical industries of the region.
By the advent of the 20th century, the growth of the University of Alabama and the mental health-care facilities in the city, along with a strong national economy fueled a steady growth in Tuscaloosa which continued unabated for 100 years.
========,3,Civil rights era.
In 1952, Autherine Lucy was admitted to the University as a graduate student, but her admission was rescinded when authorities discovered she was not white.
After three years of legal wrangling, Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP got a court order preventing the University from banning Lucy and another student based on race.
The following year, Lucy enrolled as a graduate student in Library Science on February 3, 1956, becoming the first African American ever admitted to a white public school or university in the state.
Her first day of class on February 6 was met by riots on the campus, a mob of more than a thousand men pelting the car in which she rode between classes.
Death threats were made against her life and the University president's home was stoned.
The riots were the most violent involving a pro-segregation demonstration since the landmark Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision.
After the riots, the University suspended Lucy from school stating her own safety was a concern, later expelling her on a technicality.
She was active in Civil Rights for a short while, but ended her involvement later that year.
After her expulsion was annulled by the University in 1988, Lucy reenrolled and completed her M.S.
in Library Science in 1992.
On June 11, 1963, George Wallace, the governor of Alabama, stood in front of the Foster Auditorium entrance at The University of Alabama in what became known as the Stand in the Schoolhouse Door in an attempt to stop desegregation of that institution by the enrollment of two African-American students, Vivian Malone and James Hood; when confronted by US Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and federal marshals sent in by Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, Wallace stepped aside.
President John F. Kennedy had called for the integration of the University of Alabama as well.
On June 9, 1964, in an event which later became known as Bloody Tuesday, a group of peaceful African-American Civil rights marchers were beaten, arrested and tear gassed by police while walking from the First African Baptist Church to the County Courthouse to protest against segregated restrooms and drinking fountains in the Courthouse.
Thirty-three people were sent to the hospital and 94 were arrested.
The events were not witnessed by journalists and had little impact outside the local community, unlike the Bloody Sunday events in Selma a year later.
Although Hood dropped out of school after two months, he subsequently returned and, in 1997, received his Ph.D. in philosophy.
Malone persisted in her studies and became the first African American to graduate from the university.
In 2000, the university granted her a doctorate of humane letters.
Later in his life, Wallace apologized for his opposition at that time to racial integration.
In 2010, the university formally honored Lucy, Hood and Malone by rechristening the plaza in front of Foster Auditorium as Malone-Hood Plaza and erecting a clock tower—Autherine Lucy Clock Tower—in the plaza.
========,3,2011 tornado.
On April 27, 2011, Tuscaloosa was hit by a wide EF4 tornado that resulted in 64 deaths, over 1500 injuries, and massive devastation.
44 of the fatalities were in Tuscaloosa alone, with the rest being in Birmingham and surrounding suburbs.
Its top winds were estimated by the US National Weather Service at .
Officials at DCH Regional Medical alone reported treating more than 1000 injured people in the tornado aftermath.
Officials reported dozens of unaccompanied minors being admitted for treatment at the hospital, raising questions about the possible loss of their parents.
Several were taken to pediatric trauma wards, indicating serious injuries.
Referring to the extent and severity of the damage, Mayor Walter Maddox stated that "we have neighborhoods that have been basically removed from the map."
The same tornado later went on to cause major damage in the Birmingham area.
In all, the cost of damage from the tornado amounted to $2.45 billion, making it, at the time, the costliest tornado in U.S. history, though it would be surpassed less than a month later by the devastating Joplin, Missouri tornado of May 22.
The tornado was part of the larger 2011 Super Outbreak which affected large parts of the eastern United States.
In the immediate aftermath of the tornado, thousands of rescue workers dug through the wreckage looking for survivors and recovering bodies.
More than 450 were originally listed as missing in the post-disaster chaos, leading to fears that the death toll could skyrocket to the hundreds and skepticism about the relatively slow fatality figures with respect to the number of casualties.
Rumors abounded about refrigerated trucks being brought to store unidentified remains and countless bodies at the bottom of area bodies of water.
However, the fatality figure did not increase (in fact, it decreased) and most missing persons were later found to have survived.
During this period, "The Tuscaloosa News" posted an on-line people finder to aid loved ones and friends in finding one another and to determine who was still missing.
Two days after the storm, US president Barack Obama and Alabama governor Robert Bentley, and their spouses, Michelle Obama and Diane Bentley, respectively, accompanied Mayor Maddox on a tour of the damage and the recovery efforts, along with FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate and several Congressional dignitaries.
Remarking about the scale and severity of the damage, Obama stated, "I've never seen devastation like this, it's heartbreaking" after touring the damaged areas.
Obama pledged the full resources of the federal government toward aiding the recovery efforts Bentley—himself a Tuscaloosa native—pledged additional national guard troops.
Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox announced that he was requesting 500 additional National Guard troops as well as calling for more volunteer aid workers and cadaver teams for the recovery of bodies in order to prevent the spread of disease.
The New York Yankees organization contributed $500,000 to the American Red Cross and Salvation Army to aid in recovery efforts, and the Atlanta Braves organization donated $100,000.
Actor Charlie Sheen visited the city to pay his respects on May 2 and donated supplies for relief efforts, along with several other actors, musicians and athletes.
Due to the disaster, on August 6, 2011, the University of Alabama held a delayed graduation ceremony for the class of 2011 and awarded six students who died in the tornado posthumous degrees.
The cable channel ESPN has also filmed a tribute in memory of the devastation.
========,2,Geography and climate.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Tuscaloosa has a total area of , of which is land and is water.
Most water within the city limits is in Lake Tuscaloosa, which is entirely in the city limits, and the Black Warrior River.
Tuscaloosa is located at (33.206540, −87.534607), approximately southwest of Birmingham.
It lies on the fall line of the Black Warrior River approximately upriver from the river's confluence with the Tombigbee River at Demopolis.
Because of its location on the boundary between the Appalachian Highland and the Gulf Coastal Plain, the geography of the area around Tuscaloosa is diverse, varying from heavily forested hills to the northeast to a low-lying, marshy plain to the southwest.
========,3,Climate.
Typical of the Deep South, Tuscaloosa experiences a humid subtropical climate (Köppen "Cfa") with four distinct seasons.
The Gulf of Mexico heavily influences the climate by supplying the region with warm, moist air.
During the fall, winter, and spring seasons, the interaction of this warm, moist air with cooler, drier air from the North along fronts create precipitation.
These fronts usually move from west to east as they track along the jet stream.
Notable exceptions occur during hurricane season where storms may move from due south to due north or even from east to west during land-falling hurricanes.
The interaction between low- and high-pressure air masses is most pronounced during the severe weather seasons in the spring and fall.
During the summer, the jet streams flows well to the north of the southeastern U.S., and most precipitation is consequently convectional, i.e., caused by the warm surface heating the air above.
Severe thunderstorms can bring damaging winds, large hail and occasionally tornadoes.
An F4 tornado struck Tuscaloosa County in December 2000, killing eleven people.
Tuscaloosa City was struck by an F2 tornado in January 1997 which resulted in the death of one person.
In April 2011, two tornadoes in a span of twelve days hit the city, the first being an EF3 on April 15, and the second and more devastating being an EF4 on April 27, where over 50 fatalities occurred.
According to Mayor Walter Maddox, considerable infrastructure damage was done to the city.
Winter lasts from mid-December to late-February; the daily average temperature in January is .
On average, the low temperature falls to the freezing mark or below on 46 days a year, and to or below on 4.4 days.
While rain is abundant (January and February are on average the wettest months), measurable snowfall is rare, with most years receiving none and the average seasonal snowfall amounting to .
Spring usually lasts from late-February to mid-May, becoming drier as the season progresses.
Summers last from mid-May to mid-September, and the July daily average temperature is .
There are 71–72 days of + highs annually and 3.5 days of + highs.
The latter part of summer tends to be drier.
Autumn, which spans from mid-September to early December, tends to be similar to spring in terms of temperature and precipitation.

Because the City of Tuscaloosa does not have a civic center, the demand for events grew rapidly and the Coliseum doubled its capacity in the 1970s.
In the 1990s, marquee concerts and events that the arena had seen in the previous two decades grew scarce as the facility became more outdated and mostly devoted to Crimson Tide athletic events.
In the hope that the University could pull more events at the facility, the Coliseum underwent a significant renovation in 2005, costing over $24 million.
The coliseum has hosted a diversity of events including commencement exercises, a visit by President Ronald Reagan, alumni gatherings, student convocations, concerts, operas, ballets, appearances by political figures, WCW Saturday Night, etc.
Travis Tritt filmed his "Bible Belt" country music video there.
Stars who have performed on its stages include The Rolling Stones, Elvis Presley, Elton John, Grateful Dead, Tom Petty, Led Zeppelin, Ray Charles, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, Alan Jackson, Reba McEntire, Jay Leno, Hank Williams, Jr., Daughtry, and many, many more.
In December 2010, construction on the Tuscaloosa Amphitheater officially wrapped up with the dedication ceremony taking place days after.

========,3,Port of Tuscaloosa.
Port of Tuscaloosa, Alabama is a river port located in the City of Tuscaloosa and administered by the Alabama State Port Authority.
The Black Warrior River is bounded along nearly its entire course by a series of locks and dams.
They form a chain of narrow reservoirs, providing aids to navigation and barge handling as well as hydroelectric power and drinking water.
The Black Warrior River watershed is a vital river basin entirely contained within Alabama, America's leading state for freshwater biodiversity.
Near Tuscaloosa, the river flows out of the rocky Cumberland Plateau and enters the sandy East Gulf Coastal Plain.
Barge transportation in and out of the Port of Tuscaloosa and other commercial navigation make the Black Warrior a silent giant in the state of Alabama's economy.
Though the Port of Tuscaloosa is a small one, it is one of the larger facilities on the Black Warrior River at waterway mile marker 338.5.
There are no railway connections at this port as they primarily concentrate on the shipment of dry bulk commodities, including lignite, coal and coal coke.
The federal government and the City of Tuscaloosa share the ownership of the Port of Tuscaloosa; the operation of the port is leased out to Powell Sales and has been run by them since 1997.
At waterway mile marker 343.2 on the opposite side of the river is a steel company with its own tracks at the rear of the plant connecting with the Kansas City Southern Railroad for barge shipments of iron and steel products such as ingots, bars, rods, steel slabs, plates and coils.
Tuscaloosa Steel Corporation was one of the first U.S. steel companies to implement the Steckel Mill Technology.
The Port of Tuscaloosa grew out of the system of locks and dams on the Black Warrior River built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the 1890s.
Its construction opened up an inexpensive transportation link to the Gulf seaport of Mobile, Alabama that stimulated the mining and metallurgical industries of the region that are still in operation.
The Army Corps of Engineers has maintained a system of locks and dams along the Black Warrior River for over a century to allow navigability all the way up to Birmingham.
Barge traffic thus routinely runs through Tuscaloosa to the Alabama State Docks at Mobile, on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
Via the Tenn-Tom Waterway, the city is connected to the Ohio River valley and beyond.
========,2,Sister cities.
The Tuscaloosa Sister Cities Commission was formed in 1986.
