========,2,History.
The region of Kake has been inhabited by the Tlingit indigenous people for thousands of years.
The Tlingit of the Kake region gained a reputation among early European and American explorers of being strong and powerful.
Some conflicts with early European and American explorers have been documented by historians.
Some scholars believe the first European explorer to enter Tlingit lands was Sir Frances Drake, British explorer, who traveled to the area near present-day Kake in 1579.
In February 1869 a conflict erupted between the U.S. Army and the Tlingit in the Kake region, which is referred to as the Kake War of 1869.
The conflict began when innocent Tlingit from Kake, who was visiting Sitka, was killed by a U.S. Army soldier.
The U.S. Army failed to acknowledge any wrongdoing or offer compensation to the Tlingit from the Kake region, and as result, the Tlingit from Kake followed traditional Tlingit law and killed two non-Native trappers south of Sitka.
In reprisal, the U.S. Army deployed the gunboat "USS Saginaw" from Sitka which attacked, shelled, and burned three Tlingit villages near present-day Kake.
Although all three Tlingit villages had been evacuated by the Tlingit in order to avoid loss of life from the U.S. Army's approach and intent, some Tlingit were killed as result (total number killed is unknown).
The Tlingit of the Kake area did not rebuild these three destroyed villages, but many relocated and settled around 1890 at the present site of Kake.
Kake is the site of a 128-foot totem pole, one of the world's largest, carved in 1967 for the Alaska Purchase centennial.
