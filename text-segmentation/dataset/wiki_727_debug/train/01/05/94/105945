========,1,preface.
Newton is a suburban city in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States.
It is approximately west of downtown Boston and is bordered by Boston's Brighton and West Roxbury neighborhoods to the east and south, respectively, and by the suburb of Brookline to the east, the suburbs of Watertown and Waltham to the north, and Wellesley and Needham to the west.
Rather than having a single city center, Newton resembles a patchwork of thirteen villages.
According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the population of Newton was 85,146, making it the eleventh largest city in the state.
Newton's proximity to Boston along with its historic homes, good public schools, and safe and quiet neighborhoods make it a desirable community for those who commute to Boston.
Newton is served by three modes of mass transit run by the MBTA: light rail, commuter rail, and bus service.
Newton has been consistently ranked as one of the best cities to live in in the country.
In August 2012, "Money" magazine named Newton fourth best small city among places to live in America and has been named the safest city in the country according to Aneki.
Newton was settled in 1630 as part of "the newe towne", which became Cambridge in 1638; it became its own town in 1688.
There are several historical sites of interest in the Newton area.
These include Crystal Lake (which is fronted by several historical homes), the East Parish and West Parish Burying Grounds, and the Jackson Homestead, which now houses the Newton History Museum.
Historian and local resident Diana Muir has written about the history surrounding Bullough's Pond; a scene from the 2008 production of "The Women" was also filmed there.
Portions of the 2016 drama film "Patriots Day", about the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and starring Boston native Mark Wahlberg, were filmed at Lasell College in the city.
========,2,History.
Newton was settled in 1630 as part of "the newe towne", which was renamed Cambridge in 1638.
Roxbury minister John Eliot convinced the Native American people of Nonantum, a sub-tribe of the Massachusett led by a sachem named Waban, to relocate to Natick in 1651, fearing that they would be exploited by colonists.
Newton was incorporated as a separate town, known as Cambridge Village, in 1688, then renamed Newtown in 1691, and finally Newton in 1766.
It became a city in 1873.
Newton is known as "The Garden City".
In "Reflections in Bullough's Pond", Newton historian Diana Muir describes the early industries that developed in the late 18th and early 19th centuries in a series of mills built to take advantage of the water power available at Newton Upper Falls and Newton Lower Falls.
Snuff, chocolate, glue, paper and other products were produced in these small mills but, according to Muir, the water power available in Newton was not sufficient to turn Newton into a manufacturing city, although it was, beginning in 1902, the home of the Stanley Motor Carriage Company, the maker of the Stanley Steamer.
Newton, according to Muir, became one of America's earliest commuter suburbs.
The Boston and Worcester, one of America's earliest railroads, reached West Newton in 1834.
Wealthy Bostonian businessmen took advantage of the new commuting opportunity offered by the railroad, building gracious homes on erstwhile farmland of West Newton hill and on Commonwealth street.
Muir points out that these early commuters needed sufficient wealth to employ a groom and keep horses, to drive them from their hilltop homes to the station.
Further suburbanization came in waves.
One wave began with the streetcar lines that made many parts of Newton accessible for commuters in the late nineteenth century.
The next wave came in the 1920s when automobiles became affordable to a growing upper middle class.
Even then, however, Oak Hill continued to be farmed, mostly market gardening, until the prosperity of the 1950s made all of Newton more densely settled.
Newton is not a typical "commuter suburb" since many people who live in Newton do not work in downtown Boston.
Most Newtonites work in Newton and other surrounding cities and towns.
The city has two symphony orchestras, the New Philharmonia Orchestra of Massachusetts and the Newton Symphony Orchestra.
Each April on Patriots Day, the Boston Marathon is run through the city, entering from Wellesley on Route 16 (Washington Street) where runners encounter the first of the four infamous "Newton Hills".
It then turns right onto Route 30 (Commonwealth Avenue) for the long haul into Boston.
There are two more hills before reaching Centre Street, and then the fourth and most infamous of all, Heartbreak Hill, rises shortly after Centre Street.
Residents and visitors line the race route along Washington Street and Commonwealth Avenue to cheer the runners.
========,2,Geography.
Newton is a suburban city approximately seven miles from downtown Boston, in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, at (42.337713, −71.209936).
The city is bordered by Waltham and Watertown on the north, Needham and the West Roxbury neighborhood of Boston on the south, Wellesley and Weston on the west, and Brookline and the Brighton neighborhood of Boston on the east.
From Watertown to Waltham to Needham and Dedham, Newton is bounded by the Charles River.
The Yankee Division Highway, designated Interstate 95 but known to the locals as Route 128, follows the Charles from Waltham to Dedham, creating a de facto land barrier.
The portion of Needham which lies east of 128 and west of the Charles, known as the Needham Industrial Park has become part of a Newton commercial zone and contributes to its heavy traffic, though the tax revenue goes to Needham.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.82%) is water.
========,3,Villages.
Rather than having a single city center, Newton is a patchwork of thirteen villages, many boasting small downtown areas of their own.
The 13 villages are: Auburndale, Chestnut Hill, Newton Centre, Newton Corner, Newton Highlands, Newton Lower Falls, Newton Upper Falls (both on the Charles River, and both once small industrial sites), Newtonville, Nonantum (also called "The Lake"), Oak Hill, Thompsonville, Waban and West Newton.
Oak Hill Park is a place within the village of Oak Hill that itself is shown as a separate and distinct village on some city maps (including a map dated 2010 on the official City of Newton website), and Four Corners is also shown as a village on some city maps.
Although most of the villages have a post office, they have no legal definition and no firmly defined borders.
This village-based system often causes some confusion with addresses and for first time visitors.

========,2,Education.
========,3,Former colleges.
========,4,Newton Junior College.
Newton Junior College, operated by the Newton Public Schools, opened in 1946 to serve the needs of returning veterans who otherwise would not have been able to continue their education due to the overcrowding of colleges and universities at that time.
It used the facilities of Newton High School (now Newton North High School) until its own adjacent campus was built.
It closed in 1976 due to declining enrollment and increased costs.
The availability of such places as UMass Boston contributed to its demise.
According to the city, its former campus is now "Claflin Park," a 25 unit multi-family development.

========,2,Transportation.
Newton's proximity to Boston, along with its good public schools and safe and quiet neighborhoods, make it a very desirable community for those who commute to Boston or work in Newton's businesses and industries.
Newton is well-served by three modes of mass transit run by the MBTA: light rail, commuter rail, and bus service.
The Green Line "D" Branch, (also known as the Riverside branch) is a light rail line running through the center of the city that makes very frequent trips to downtown Boston, ranging from 10 to 30 minutes away.
The Green Line "B" Branch ends across from Boston College on Commonwealth Avenue, virtually at the border of Boston's Brighton neighborhood and the City of Newton (an area which encompasses an unincorporated suburban village referred to as Chestnut Hill).
The MBTA Worcester commuter rail, serving the northern villages of Newton that are proximate to Waltham, offers less frequent service to Boston.
It runs from every half-an-hour during peak times to every couple of hours otherwise.
The northern villages are also served by frequent express buses that go to downtown Boston via the Massachusetts Turnpike as well as Waltham.
Newton Centre, which is centered around the Newton Centre MBTA station, has been lauded as an example of transit-oriented development.
The Massachusetts Turnpike (Interstate 90), which basically follows the old Boston and Albany Railroad main line right-of-way, runs east and west through Newton, while Route 128 (Interstate 95) slices through the extreme western part of the city in the Lower Falls area.
Route 30 (Commonwealth Avenue), Route 16 (Watertown Street west to West Newton, where it follows Washington Street west) and route 9 (Worcester Turnpike or Boylston Street) also run east and west through the city.
Another major Boston (and Brookline) street, Beacon Street, runs west from the Boston city line to Washington Street west of the hospital, where it terminates at Washington Street.
There are no major north-south roads through Newton: every north-south street in Newton terminates within Newton at one end or the other.
The only possible exception is Needham Street, which is north-south at the border between Newton and Needham, but it turns east and becomes Dedham Street, and when it reaches the Boston border, it goes south-east.
There are some north-south streets that are important to intra-Newton traveling.
Centre Street runs south from the Watertown town line to Newton Highlands, where it becomes Winchester Street and terminates at Nahanton Street.
Walnut Street runs south from Newtonville, where it starts at Crafts Street, down to Newton Highlands, where it ends at Dedham Street.
