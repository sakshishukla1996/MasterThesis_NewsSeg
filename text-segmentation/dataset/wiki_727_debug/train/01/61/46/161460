Lust for Life (1956) is a MGM (Metrocolor) biographical film about the life of the Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh, based on the 1934 novel of the same name by Irving Stone and adapted by Norman Corwin.
It was directed by Vincente Minnelli and produced by John Houseman.
The film stars Kirk Douglas as Van Gogh, James Donald as his brother Theo, Pamela Brown, Everett Sloane and Anthony Quinn, who won an Oscar for his performance as Van Gogh's fast friend and rival Paul Gauguin.
========,2,Plot.
Vincent van Gogh's obsessive devotion to his art engulfs, consumes and finally destroys him.
The apostate religious leaders do not like his zeal for God, and they frown on his social activism and care for the poor in a coal mining town.
He returns home to his father's house where he is rejected by a woman he obsessively loves (his cousin), takes up with a prostitute who leaves because he is too hot, and discovers painting, which he pursues while agonizing that his vision exceeds his ability to execute.
His brother, Theo van Gogh, provides financial and moral support, while Vincent lives off and on with the critical Paul Gauguin.
Vincent begins experiencing hallucinations and seizures and voluntarily commits himself to a mental institution.
He signs himself out, and with Theo's help returns to a rural area to resume painting.
There he ultimately shoots himself in despair of never being able to put what he sees on canvas.
========,2,Production.
The film was based on the 1934 novel by Irving Stone and adapted by Norman Corwin.
Vincent Minnelli directed the film, while John Houseman produced it.
They worked with Douglas on the 1952 melodrama "The Bad and the Beautiful", for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor.
Principal photography started in August and ended in December 1955 and it was shot on location in France, Belgium and the Netherlands.
George Cukor took Minnelli's place as director for the take of a scene.
Two hundred enlarged colour photos were used representing Vincentâ€™s completed canvases; these were in addition to copies that were executed by an American art teacher, Robert Parker.
To prepare for his role as the troubled painter, Douglas practiced painting crows so that he could reasonably imitate van Gogh at work.
According to his wife Anne, Douglas was so into character that he returned to home in character.
When asked if he would do such a thing again, Douglas responded that he wouldn't.
========,2,Reception.
"New York Times" critic Bosley Crowther praised the film's conception, acting and color scheme, noting the design team "consciously made the flow of color and the interplay of compositions and hues the most forceful devices for conveying a motion picture comprehension of van Gogh."
"Variety" said, "This is a slow-moving picture whose only action is in the dialog itself."
