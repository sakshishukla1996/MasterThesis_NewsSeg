========,1,preface.
Girl, Interrupted is a best-selling 1993 memoir by American author Susanna Kaysen, relating her experiences as a young woman in a psychiatric hospital in the 1960s after being diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.
The memoir's title is a reference to the Vermeer painting "Girl Interrupted at Her Music".
While writing the novel "Far Afield", Kaysen began to recall her almost two years at McLean Hospital.
She obtained her file from the hospital with the help of a lawyer.
In 1999, the memoir was adapted into a film of the same name starring Winona Ryder, Angelina Jolie and Brittany Murphy.
It was directed by James Mangold.
========,2,Plot introduction.
The plot of "Girl, Interrupted" does not follow a linear storyline, but instead the author provides personal stories through a series of short descriptions of events and personal reflections on why she was placed in the hospital.
She begins by talking about the concept of a parallel universe and how easy it is to slip into one, comparing insanity to an alternate world.
She discusses how some people fall into insanity gradually and others just snap.
Kaysen also details the doctor's visit before first going to the hospital and the taxi ride there at the beginning of the book before launching into the chronicles of her time at the hospital.
The hospital also sits upon a hill, and it's a big brick building.
========,2,Plot summary.
In April 1967, 18-year-old Susanna Kaysen is admitted to McLean Hospital, in Belmont, Massachusetts, after attempting suicide by overdosing on pills.
She denies that it was a suicide attempt to a psychiatrist, who suggests she take time to regroup in McLean, a private mental hospital.
Susanna is diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and her stay extends to 18 months rather than the proposed couple of weeks.
Fellow patients Polly, Cynthia, Lisa Rowe, Lisa Cody, Georgina, and Daisy contribute to Susanna’s experiences at McLean as she describes their personal issues and how they come to cope with the time they must spend in the hospital.
Susanna also introduces the reader to particular staff members, including Valerie, Dr. Wick and Mrs. McWeeney.
Susanna and the other girls are eventually informed that the recently released Daisy committed suicide on her birthday.
Daisy's death deeply saddens the girls and they hold a prolonged moment of silence in her memory.
Susanna reflects on the nature of her illness, including difficulty making sense of visual patterns, and suggests that sanity is a falsehood constructed to help the "healthy" feel "normal" in comparison.
She also questions how doctors treat mental illness, and whether they are treating the brain or the mind.
During her stay in the ward, Susanna also undergoes a period of depersonalization, where she bites open the flesh on her hand after she becomes terrified that she has "lost her bones."
She develops a frantic obsession with the verification of this proposed reality and even insists on seeing an X-ray of herself to make sure.
This hectic moment is described with shorter, choppy sentences that show Kaysen's state of mind and thought processes as she went through them.
Also, during a trip to the dentist with Valerie, Susanna becomes frantic after she wakes from the general anesthesia, when no one will tell her how long she was unconscious, and she fears that she has lost time.
Like the incident with her bones, Kaysen here also rapidly spirals into a panicky and obsessive state that is only ultimately calmed with medication.
After leaving McLean, Susanna mentions that she kept in touch with Georgina and eventually saw Lisa, now a single mother who was about to board the subway with her adolescent son and seemed, although quirky, to be sane.
========,2,Characters.

========,2,Book reviews.
"Poignant, honest and triumphantly funny... A compelling and heartbreaking story."
"Searing... "Girl, Interrupted" captures an exquisite range of self-awareness between madness and insight."
— "The Boston Globe" "Tough-minded... darkly comic... written with indelible clarity."
— "Newsweek" "Ingenious... designed to provoke unanswerable questions.
Kaysen does not point morals or impose insights, but lets adroit imagery, powerful scene-writing and the silence between chapters do the work of judgement... [It is] an account of a disturbed girl's unwilling passage into womanhood... and here is the girl, looking into our faces with urgent eyes."
