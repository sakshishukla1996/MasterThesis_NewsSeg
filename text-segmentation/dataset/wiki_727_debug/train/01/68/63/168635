========,1,preface.
Iran Air, branded as The Airline of the Islamic Republic of Iran ( "Havâpeymâyiye Jomhuriye Eslâmiye Irân"), is the national flag carrier airline of Iran headquartered on the grounds of Mehrabad Airport in Tehran.
Tehran-Imam Khomeini and Tehran-Mehrabad are its main bases for international and domestic flights.
As of May 2017, it operates scheduled services to 56 destinations in Asia and the Europe.
The airline has a subsidiary for cargo services, called Iran Air Cargo, that operates scheduled and charter services.
Iran Air is also referred to by its pre-revolution Persian acronym, Homa (Havâpeymâyiye Melliye Irân), which is also the name of a mythical Persian griffin, Homa.
========,2,History.
========,3,Formation.
Iranian Airways was founded in May 1944 by Reza Afshar and Gholam Ebtehaj.
Post-war, its first passenger flight was from Tehran to Mashhad, followed by a Tehran-Esfahan-Shiraz-Bushehr-Abadan-Ahwaz service.
In 1946 the airline established service to Cairo, Baghdad and Tel Aviv, and in April 1947, to Paris.
Between 1945 and 1962, the airline became a major domestic carrier, also operating some international flights to Europe each week.
The fleet consisted of Douglas DC-3s initially, supplemented by Douglas DC-4 and Vickers Viscount aircraft later on.
In 1954, the privately owned airline Persian Air Services (PAS) was established.
PAS initially operated only freight services, followed by passenger operations between Tehran and other major cities in Iran.
In 1960, PAS initiated passenger service to several European destinations, including Geneva, Paris, Brussels and London, using Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-7 aircraft leased from Sabena.
Iranian Airways was nationalized in 1961.
On 24 February 1962, Iranian Airways and PAS merged to form the Iran National Airlines Corporation (HOMA), known as Iran Air, using the homa bird as a symbol.
HOMA was a public sector venture that combined the two predecessor air carriers.
Among the aircraft used were Avro Yorks, Douglas DC-3s, Douglas DC-6s and Vickers Viscounts.
The carrier became a full member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) in 1964.
It was the first airline to operate the Boeing 747SP.
========,3,Expansion.
In 1965, Iran Air took delivery of its first jet aircraft, the Boeing 707 and the Boeing 727-100, followed by the Boeing 737–200 in 1971, the stretched Boeing 727-200 in 1974 and three variants of Boeing 747 (747-100, −200 and SP), starting in 1978–1979.
By the mid-1970s, Iran Air was serving cities in Europe with non-stop and one-stop flights, including over 30 flights a week to London alone.
On 29 May 1971, the Tehran to New York City route was inaugurated, using Boeing 707s making a stop-over at London Heathrow Airport.
Shortly thereafter, the route was upgraded to a non-stop flight using Boeing 747SPs, making Iran Air the second Middle Eastern carrier (after El Al), to offer non-stop service to New York.
With this flight, Iran Air set a new world record in time and distance for a non-stop, scheduled long-haul flight (12 hours and 15 minutes, 9,867 km – 6,131 mi – 5,328 nm).
In 1978, the airline acquired six Airbus A300 aircraft for use on its domestic trunk and busy regional routes.
By the end of that year, Iran Air was serving 31 international destinations stretching from New York City to Beijing and Tokyo.
Plans were made to offer direct services to Los Angeles and to Sydney, for which the airline's long range Boeing 747SP aircraft were ideal.
This would have allowed Iran Air to use Tehran as a midway point between East and West, because of its favorable geographical location.
Such plans were never realized.
By the late 1970s, Iran Air was the fastest growing airline in the world and one of the most profitable.
By 1976, Iran Air was ranked second only to Qantas, as the world’s safest airline, having been accident free for at least ten consecutive years.
Although both airlines were accident free, Iran Air came second only because of fewer operational hours flown compared to Qantas.
Prior to this ranking, a fatal accident had occurred on 25 December 1952, in which 27 of the 29 passengers on board perished when their Douglas DC-3 crashed on landing.
========,3,Iranian Revolution.
As a result of economic sanctions against Iran, Iran Air was unable to expand or replace its fleet.
Last time Iran Air was delivered brand-new Western aircraft prior to the 2016 lifting of nuclear-related sanctions was in 1994 when it received two Airbus A300-B4s in compensation for the downing of Iran Air Flight 655 by an American cruiser in 1988.
In 2001, Iran Air purchased 6 second-hand Airbus A300s from Turkey, but only after two years, all 6 of them ended up grounded at airports in Tehran, Mashhad and Moscow.
This caused significant controversy in Iran where officials cited GE engine design flaw and subsequent overheating as the reason for grounding the planes.
One of these 6 planes was later confirmed to have returned to service by 2010.
Prior to the separation of Iran Air Tours from Iran Air in 2011, Russian-made Tupolev Tu-154s formed the backbone of the former's fleet.
However, several successive disasters involving this plane ultimately led to a 2011 blanket ban on its operations within Iranian airlines, including Iran Air Tours.
The Tu-154 fleet was gradually replaced with MD-83s over the course of a few months.
According to Iran's Deputy Minister of Roads and Urban Devopment, Iran currently has more than 100 planes, some of them owned by Iran Air, grounded due to the lack of access to new parts and technical expertise during the sanctions era.
The prolonged period of time that Iran Air was under international sanctions and barred from purchasing spare parts and new planes led to a dramatic rise in its average fleet age and plunging safety record, to the extent where it became widely known as one of the worst airlines in the world in terms of air safety record.
As of March 2017, Iran Air's average fleet age stands at 24.1 years, though this figure is set to improve through addition of new deliveries.
Iran Air's extremely subpar on-time performance, amongst those of most other Iranian airlines, has led to public anger and frustration, often inciting protests in the form of violent confrontations with the airline employees or airplane sit-ins for many hours after a severely-delayed flight has finally landed.
Officials routinely attribute the delays to the economic sanctions, although at least one pro-revolutionary idealogue has cited "inefficiency and mismanagement" as the chief cause of this issue.
========,3,Refueling issues and EU ban.
On 5 July 2010, an aviation official of Iran accused the U.K., Germany and the United Arab Emirates of refusing to refuel Iranian passenger jets.
This move followed unilateral sanctions imposed by the US over the nuclear weapons dispute.
Iran Air and Mahan Air both claimed to have been denied refuelling.
A spokeswoman for Abu Dhabi Airports Company (ADAC) said that a contract was in place to refuel Iranian passenger flights and ADAC would continue to do so.
A spokesperson for the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority said that it was the sole decision of independent suppliers if aircraft were to be refuelled or not.
Germany's Transport Ministry said the refuelling of Iranian aircraft was not banned under EU or UN sanctions but did not say whether any independent refuellers were denying refuelling.
Later in the day, Dubai Airport revealed that it continued to refuel Iranian passengers flights in and out of Dubai.
The next day, a spokesperson for Iran said that no such limitation had been imposed.
On 6 July 2010, it was announced that the European Commission would ban all of Iran Air's Airbus A320, Boeing 727 and Boeing 747 fleet from the EU over safety concerns.
This move came as a major blow to Iran Air, limiting flights to Europe with its own aircraft.
In 2012, the EU re-allowed the refuelling of Iran Air aircraft at secondary European airports such as Ljubljana and Budapest, in an effort to retain the refuelling contracts within the EU, rather than letting them go to Serbia or later Belarus and Ukraine.
In January 2012, Iran Air's flights to and from London Heathrow operated with a fuel stop at Manston Airport in Kent.
However, the airport announced in December 2011 that this arrangement was to end and it would no longer refuel the company's aircraft.
This announcement swiftly followed the closure of Iran's embassy in London as the consequence of the ransacking of the British embassy in Tehran.
The airport stressed that it had not breached any trade agreements, as it had no connections with the USA.
========,3,Lifting of sanctions and modernization plans.
In anticipation of a deal being reached for the lifting of sanctions, the chairman of Iran Air - Farhad Parvaresh - stated that the airline would then seek to obtain at least 100 wide-body and short-haul jets.
On Friday 15 January 2016 US president Barack Obama authorized his secretary of state, John Kerry, to lift the sanctions on Iran civil aviation.
Following Iran's implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on 16 January 2016, all sanctions on Iran civil aviation were lifted.
As a result, Iranian airlines, including Iran Air, were granted permission to purchase new civil aircraft from any manufacturer as well as to refuel at all European airports, except for two Swedish destinations, Stockholm and Gothenburg, due to the fuel supplier British Petroleum still refusing to provide fuel to the Iranian carriers.
On 24 January 2016 Tehran hosted the CAPA Iran Aviation Summit organised by CAPA - Centre for Aviation in order to bring both Iranian and international aviation authorities together for considering development plans for Iran's aviation industry.
CAPA put the size of Iran's economy somewhere between those of Turkey and Australia, whose commercial airline fleets are in the order of 500-600 aircraft.
Bombardier presented its regional models during the CAPA summit in Tehran.
========,2,Onboard restrictions.
========,3,Hijab.
Iran Air, in a similar fashion to all other Iranian airlines, mandates its female passengers and cabin crew to observe the Islamic dress code and fully cover their hair and body at all times, with a strong emphasis on wearing a headscarf or other permissible forms of Hijab.
Albeit strictly observed on all domestic flights, this rule is rarely enforced on international flights for the duration of time that passengers are on board the plane.
========,3,Food and beverages.
Iran Air is one of the few airlines in the world that, pursuant to the Sharia, does not serve alcohol on any of its flights.
Moreover, there is no choice of non-Halal food selections, such as those containing pork, on Iran Air's menu.
========,2,Destinations.
========,3,Pilgrims and Hajj.
Until 2016, Hajj charter operations formed a major part of Iran Air's annual activities.
Every year, tens of thousands of pilgrims flew from major cities in Iran to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia's air gateway to Mecca, to take part in pilgrimage ceremonies.
In 2016, due to escalating tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia, all Hajj flights from Iran were suspended indefinitely.
========,2,Fleet.
========,3,Future fleet plans.
========,4,Airbus.
In January 2016 Iran Air signed an agreement for 118 Airbus aircraft, to be made up of several different members of the manufacturer's twin-engine product line and 12 A380s.
On 22 December 2016, Airbus announced a smaller firm deal for 100 aircraft, comprising 46 Airbus A320 family and Airbus A320neo family aircraft; 16 A350s; and 38 A330s and A330neos; no A380s were ordered, after the airline concluded that Iranian airports lack the infrastructure to handle them.
In January 2017, Airbus began the delivery process, starting with an A321 followed by 2 A330-200s, all initially ordered by and built for Avianca but never delivered.
========,4,ATR.
On 1 February 2016, Iran Air signed an agreement with aircraft manufacturer ATR, covering an order of twenty ATR 72-600 turboprop aircraft plus options for twenty more.
Iran Air intends to use the ATR 72s as part of its strategy to expand its domestic market reach and to provide service to the smaller airports that are located in less populated cities of Iran.
Deliveries were planned to begin in early 2017 but this has been since delayed due to a stall in talks with the Canadian manufacturer of ATR power plants, Pratt & Whitney Canada, over after-sales support and maintenance of the engines.
In the event, the first batch of four aircraft were delivered in a convoy on 16 May 2017.
========,4,Boeing.
In June 2016, Iran Air officially announced that it was in talks with Boeing for a possible order "close in size to the 118 Airbus aircraft agreement".
On 21 June 2016 Boeing announced it has signed a tentative agreement to sell jetliners to Iran, in what would be one of the Islamic Republic’s biggest deals with a U.S. manufacturer since trade sanctions on Tehran were eased.
On 11 December 2016, Boeing announced a provisional order by Iran Air for eighty aircraft, subject to "contingencies [being] cleared"; the order comprises fifty 737 MAX-8s, fifteen 777-300ERs and fifteen 777-9s.
========,3,Former fleet.
========,4,Concorde order.
On 8 October 1972, Iran Air placed an order with British Aircraft Corporation for two Aérospatiale-BAC Concorde supersonic jets plus an option for one, rendering it the last airline to place Concorde orders for commercial use.
However, Iran Air - having had briefly chartered one Concorde jet on flights between Tehran and Paris - cancelled these orders in April 1980.
========,2,Former subsidiaries.
========,3,Iran Air Tours.
Iran Air Tours was founded in 1973 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Iran Air, focusing on charter flights and tourism.
In 2011, the company was purchased by Hesayar Cooperative Company, itself a subsidiary of the Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics.
However, Hesayar failed to meet its financial commitments and the airline prompty returned to private hands in 2016.
========,3,Homa Hotel Group.
Homa Hotel Group was founded in 1979 by the Government of Iran after it completed a nationalization of the hotel industry.
As of 2016, it was owned by Iran's Social Security Organization.
========,2,Accidents and incidents.
========,3,Overview.
Before the two companies merged in 1962 to form Iran Air, Iranian Airways and Persian Air Services had several aircraft hull losses.
Iranian Airways lost six Douglas DC-3s in crashes and a fire between 1949 and 1959; and one of its Douglas DC-4s was shot down in 1961; while Persian Air Services lost three Avro Yorks in crashes and a maintenance accident between 1955 and 1959.
Since 1962, Iran Air has had more than a dozen aircraft hull losses in crashes and the shooting-down of Iran Air Flight 655; the airline has also experienced twenty hijacking incidents on its aircraft.
