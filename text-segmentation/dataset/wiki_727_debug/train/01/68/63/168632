========,2,History.
========,3,1847 to 1901.
Siemens & Halske was founded by Werner von Siemens and Johann Georg Halske on 12 October 1847.
Based on the telegraph, their invention used a needle to point to the sequence of letters, instead of using Morse code.
The company, then called "Telegraphen-Bauanstalt von Siemens & Halske", opened its first workshop on 12 October.
In 1848, the company built the first long-distance telegraph line in Europe; 500 km from Berlin to Frankfurt am Main.
In 1850, the founder's younger brother, Carl Wilhelm Siemens, later Sir William Siemens, started to represent the company in London.
The London agency became a branch office in 1858.
In the 1850s, the company was involved in building long distance telegraph networks in Russia.
In 1855, a company branch headed by another brother, Carl Heinrich von Siemens, opened in St Petersburg, Russia.
In 1867, Siemens completed the monumental Indo-European (Calcutta to London) telegraph line.
In 1867, Werner von Siemens described a dynamo without permanent magnets.
A similar system was also independently invented by Charles Wheatstone, but Siemens became the first company to build such devices.
In 1881, a Siemens AC Alternator driven by a watermill was used to power the world's first electric street lighting in the town of Godalming, United Kingdom.
The company continued to grow and diversified into electric trains and light bulbs.
In 1890, the founder retired and left running the company to his brother Carl and sons Arnold and Wilhelm.
In 1887, it opened its first office in Japan.
========,3,1901 to 1933.
Siemens & Halske (S & H) was incorporated in 1897, and then merged parts of its activities with Schuckert & Co., Nuremberg in 1903 to become Siemens-Schuckert.
In 1907, Siemens (Siemens & Halske and Siemens-Schuckert) had 34,324 employees and was the seventh-largest company in the German empire by number of employees.
(see List of German companies by employees in 1907) In 1919, S & H and two other companies jointly formed the Osram lightbulb company.
During the 1920s and 1930s, S & H started to manufacture radios, television sets, and electron microscopes.
In 1932, (Erlangen), Phönix AG (Rudolstadt) and Siemens-Reiniger-Veifa mbH (Berlin) merged to form the Siemens-Reiniger-Werke AG (SRW), the third of the so-called parent companies that merged in 1966 to form the present-day Siemens AG.
In the 1920s, Siemens constructed the Ardnacrusha Hydro Power station on the River Shannon in the then Irish Free State, and it was a world first for its design.
The company is remembered for its desire to raise the wages of its under-paid workers only to be overruled by the Cumann na nGaedheal government.
========,3,1933 to 1945.
Siemens (at the time: Siemens-Schuckert) exploited the forced labour of deported people in extermination camps.
The company owned a plant in Auschwitz concentration camp.
During the final years of World War II, numerous plants and factories in Berlin and other major cities were destroyed by Allied air raids.
To prevent further losses, manufacturing was therefore moved to alternative places and regions not affected by the air war.
The goal was to secure continued production of important war-related and everyday goods.
According to records, Siemens was operating almost 400 alternative or relocated manufacturing plants at the end of 1944 and in early 1945.
In 1972, Siemens sued German satirist F.C.
Delius for his satirical history of the company, "Unsere Siemenswelt", and it was determined much of the book contained false claims although the trial itself publicized Siemens' history in Nazi Germany.
The company supplied electrical parts to Nazi concentration camps and death camps.
The factories had poor working conditions, where malnutrition and death were common.
Also, the scholarship has shown that the camp factories were created, run, and supplied by the SS, in conjunction with company officials, sometimes high-level officials.
Siemens businessman and Nazi Party member John Rabe is, however, credited with saving many Chinese lives during the infamous Nanking Massacre.
He later toured Germany lecturing on the atrocities committed by Japanese forces in Nanking.

Two months later Siemens agreed to pay a $1.6 billion penalty to US and German authorities to resolve the case.
========,3,European Union.
In January 2007, Siemens was fined €396 million by the European Commission for price fixing in EU electricity markets through a cartel involving 11 companies, including ABB, Alstom, Fuji Electric, Hitachi Japan, AE Power Systems, Mitsubishi Electric Corp, Schneider, Areva, Toshiba and VA Tech.
According to the Commission, "between 1988 and 2004, the companies rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices, allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information."
Siemens was given the highest fine of €396 million, more than half of the total, for its alleged leadership role in the activity.
Siemens agreed to pay a record $1.34 billion in fines in December 2008 after being investigated for bribery.
The investigation found questionable payments of roughly €1.3 billion, from 2002 to 2006 that triggered a broad range of inquiries in Germany, the United States and other countries.
In May 2007 a German court convicted two former executives of paying about €6 million in bribes from 1999 to 2002 to help Siemens win natural gas turbine supply contracts with Enel, an Italian energy company.
The contracts were valued at about €450 million.
Siemens was fined €38 million.
========,3,Iran.
Nokia Siemens supplied telecommunications equipment to the Iranian telecom company that included the ability to intercept and monitor telecommunications, a facility known as "lawful intercept".
The equipment was believed to have been used in the suppression of the 2009 Iranian election protests, leading to criticism of the company, including by the European Parliament.
Nokia-Siemens later divested its call monitoring business, and reduced its activities in Iran.
========,3,Greece.
Siemens has been accused of bribing Greek officials.
In 2008, it was revealed that Siemens had bribed the two main political parties of Greece for approximately 10 years to be the sole provider of mechanical and electrical equipment of the Greek state.
After the exposure the German authorities moved to arrest the representatives of Siemens in Greece, who had managed to escape from the Greek authorities.
The German judicial system didn't allow the Greek authorities to cross-question the representatives.
As a result, there wasn't any solid evidence against the corrupt politicians, who weren't arrested and continue to be active in the Greek political system.
Meanwhile, the Greek state cancelled the planned business deals.
In August 2012, the Greek government signed a settlement with Siemens for these corruption cases worth 330 million euros.
The trial of the persons accused of involvement in the scandal began on 24 February 2017.
A total of 64 individuals are accused, both Greek and German nationals.
The central figure of the scandal however, ex-Siemens chief executive in Greece Michael Christoforakos, against whom European arrest warrants are pending will likely be absent, as Germany refuses his extradition to this day.
Initially arrested in Germany in 2009, the accusations against him by German courts have been dropped, and he since lives free in this country.
Greece has been demanding his extradition since 2009, and considers him a fugitive from justice.
========,3,Israel.
In 2014 Israeli prosecutors decreed that Siemens should pay US$42.7 million penalty and appoint an external inspector to supervise its business in Israel in exchange for state prosecutors dropping charges of securities fraud.
According to the indictment, "Siemens systematically paid bribes to Israel Electric Corporation executives so they would utilize their positions in order to favor and advance the interests of Siemens".
========,3,Augmented Compliance System.
Around the time of its 2008 corruption settlement with the United States government, Siemens overhauled and greatly expanded its compliance organization, eventually totaling more than 500 full time compliance personnel worldwide.
Siemens also enacted a series of new anti-corruption compliance policies, including a new anti-corruption handbook, sophisticated web-based tools for due diligence and compliance, a confidential communications channel for employees to report irregular business practices, and a corporate disciplinary committee to impose appropriate disciplinary measures for substantiated misconduct.
