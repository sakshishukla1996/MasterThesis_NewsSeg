========,1,preface.
Kristoffer Kristofferson (born June 22, 1936) is an American singer-songwriter, musician, and actor.
He wrote and recorded the songs "Me and Bobby McGee", "For the Good Times", "Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down", and "Help Me Make It Through the Night".
Kristofferson composed his own songs and collaborated with Nashville songwriters such as Shel Silverstein.
In 1985, Kristofferson joined fellow country artists Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and Johnny Cash in forming the country music supergroup The Highwaymen.
In 2004, Kristofferson was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.
He is also known for his starring roles in "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore" and "A Star Is Born", for the latter of which he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor.
========,2,Early life.
Kristoffer Kristofferson was born in Brownsville, Texas, to Mary Ann (n√©e Ashbrook) and Lars Henry Kristofferson, a U.S. Army Air Corps officer (later a U.S. Air Force Major General).
His paternal grandparents emigrated from Sweden, while his mother had English, Scottish-Irish, German, Swiss-German, and Dutch ancestry.
Kristofferson's paternal grandfather was an officer in the Swedish Army.
When Kristofferson was a child, his father pushed him towards a military career.
At the age of 17, Kristofferson took a summer job with a dredging contractor on Wake Island.
He called it "the hardest job I ever had."
========,2,Education.
Like most "military brats," Kristofferson moved around frequently as a youth, finally settling down in San Mateo, California, where he graduated from San Mateo High School.
An aspiring writer, Kristofferson enrolled in Pomona College in 1954.
He experienced his first dose of fame when he appeared in "Sports Illustrated"'s "Faces in the Crowd" for his achievements in collegiate rugby union, American football, and track and field.
He and his classmates revived the Claremont Colleges Rugby Club in 1958, which has remained a southern California rugby institution.
Kristofferson became a member of Kappa Delta fraternity at Pomona College, graduating in 1958 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, "summa cum laude", in literature.
He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa his junior year.
In a 2004 interview with "Pomona College Magazine", Kristofferson mentioned philosophy professor Frederick Sontag as an important influence in his life.
Kristofferson earned a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford University, where he studied at Merton College.
While at Oxford, he was awarded his Blue for boxing, played rugby for his college, and began writing songs.
At Oxford, he was also acquainted with fellow Rhodes scholar, art critic, and poet Michael Fried.
With the help of his manager, Larry Parnes, Kristofferson recorded for Top Rank Records under the name Kris Carson.
Parnes was working to sell Kristofferson as "a Yank at Oxford" to the British public; Kristofferson was willing to accept that promotional approach if it helped his singing career, which he hoped would enable him to progress towards his goal of becoming a novelist.
This early phase of his music career was unsuccessful.
In 1960, Kristofferson graduated with a B.Phil in English literature.
The following year he married his long-time girlfriend, Frances Mavia Beer.
========,2,Career.
========,3,Military service.
Kristofferson, under pressure from his family, ultimately joined the U.S. Army and attained the rank of Captain.
He became a helicopter pilot after receiving flight training at Fort Rucker, Alabama.
He also completed Ranger School.
During the early 1960s, he was stationed in West Germany as a member of the 8th Infantry Division.
During this time, he resumed his music career and formed a band.
In 1965, when his tour of duty ended, Kristofferson was given an assignment to teach English literature at West Point.
Instead, he decided to leave the Army and pursue songwriting.
His family disowned him because of his career decision and sources are unclear on whether or not they ever truly reconciled.
They saw it as a rejection of everything they stood for, in spite of the fact that Kristofferson has said he is proud of his time in the military, and received the American Veterans Awards "Veteran of the Year Award" in 2003.
========,3,Music.
After leaving the Army in 1965, Kristofferson moved to Nashville.
He worked at a variety of odd jobs while struggling for success in music, burdened with medical expenses resulting from his son's defective esophagus.
He and his wife soon divorced.
He got a job sweeping floors at Columbia Recording Studios in Nashville.
He met June Carter there and asked her to give Johnny Cash a tape of his.
She did, but Johnny put it in a large pile with others.
Weeks later Kristofferson landed a helicopter in Cash's front yard, gaining his full attention.
[Note: In a later interview, Kristofferson maintained Cash was not at home when he landed the helicopter.
The story about Kristofferson having a beer in one hand and some songs in the other is a fable.]
Cash decided to record "Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down" and that year Kristofferson won songwriter of the year at the country music awards.
He also worked as a commercial helicopter pilot for a south Louisiana firm called Petroleum Helicopters International (PHI), based in Lafayette, Louisiana.
Kristofferson recalled of his days as a pilot, "That was about the last three years before I started performing, before people started cutting my songs ...
I would work a week down here [in south Louisiana] for PHI, sitting on an oil platform and flying helicopters.
Then I'd go back to Nashville at the end of the week and spend a week up there trying to pitch the songs, then come back down and write songs for another week ...
I can remember "Help Me Make It Through the Night" I wrote sitting on top of an oil platform.
I wrote "Bobby McGee" down here, and a lot of them [in south Louisiana]."
In 1966, Dave Dudley released a successful Kristofferson single, "Viet Nam Blues."
In 1967, Kristofferson signed to Epic Records and released a single, "Golden Idol/Killing Time," but the song was not successful.
Within the next few years, more Kristofferson originals hit the charts, performed by Roy Drusky ("Jody and the Kid"); Billy Walker & the Tennessee Walkers ("From the Bottle to the Bottom"); Ray Stevens ("Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down"); Jerry Lee Lewis ("Once More with Feeling"); Faron Young ("Your Time's Comin'"); and Roger Miller ("Me and Bobby McGee," "Best of all Possible Worlds," and "Darby's Castle").
He achieved some success as a performer himself, following Johnny Cash's introduction of him at the Newport Folk Festival.
Kristofferson signed to Monument Records as a recording artist.
In addition to running that label, Fred Foster also served as manager of Combine Music, Kristofferson's songwriting label.
His debut album for Monument in 1970 was "Kristofferson", which included a few new songs, as well as many of his previous hits.
Sales were poor, although this debut album would become a success the following year when it was re-released under the title "Me & Bobby McGee".
Kristofferson's compositions were still in high demand.
Ray Price ("For the Good Times"), Gladys Knight & The Pips ("Help Me Make It Through The Night"), Waylon Jennings ("The Taker"), Bobby Bare ("Come Sundown"), Johnny Cash ("Sunday Morning Coming Down"), and Sammi Smith ("Help Me Make It Through the Night") all recorded successful versions of his songs in the early 1970s.
"For the Good Times" (Ray Price) won "Song of the Year" in 1970 from the Academy of Country Music, while "Sunday Morning Coming Down" (Johnny Cash) won the same award from the Academy's rival, the Country Music Association, in the same year.
This is the only time an individual received the same award from these two organizations in the same year for different songs.
In 1971, Janis Joplin, who dated Kristofferson for some time until her death, had a number one hit with "Me and Bobby McGee" from her posthumous album "Pearl".
When released, it stayed on the number-one spot on the charts for weeks.
More hits followed from others: Ray Price ("I'd Rather Be Sorry"); Joe Simon ("Help Me Make It Through the Night"); Bobby Bare ("Please Don't Tell Me How the Story Ends"); O.C.
Smith ("Help Me Make It Through the Night"); Jerry Lee Lewis ("Me and Bobby McGee"); Patti Page ("I'd Rather Be Sorry"); and Peggy Little ("I've Got to Have You").
The country music performer Kenny Rogers has also recorded some of Kristofferson's compositions, including a version of Me and Bobby McGee in 1969 with The First Edition for the Ruby, Don't Take Your Love To Town album.
Kristofferson released his second album, "The Silver Tongued Devil and I" in 1971; including "Lovin' Her Was Easier (Than Anything I'll Ever Do Again)".
It was a success and established Kristofferson's career as a recording artist in his own right.
Soon after, Kristofferson made his acting debut in "The Last Movie" (directed by Dennis Hopper) and appeared at the Isle of Wight Festival.
A portion of his Isle of Wight performance is featured on the three disc compilation The First Great Rock Festivals of the Seventies.
In 1971, he acted in "Cisco Pike" and released his third album, "Border Lord".
The album was all-new material and sales were sluggish.
He also swept the Grammy Awards that year with numerous songs nominated, winning country song of the year for "Help Me Make It Through the Night."
Kristofferson's 1972 fourth album, "Jesus Was a Capricorn", initially had slow sales, but the third single, "Why Me," was a success and significantly increased album sales.
It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA on November 8, 1973.
In 1972, Kristofferson appeared with Rita Coolidge on British TV on BBC's "The Old Grey Whistle Test", performing a physically intimate version of "Help Me Make It Through The Night".
========,3,Film.
For the next few years, Kristofferson focused on acting.
He appeared in "Blume in Love" (directed by Paul Mazursky) and "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid" (directed by Sam Peckinpah).
He continued acting, in Sam Peckinpah's "Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia", "Convoy", (another Sam Peckinpah film which was released in 1978), "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore", "Vigilante Force", a film based on the Yukio Mishima novel "The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea", "A Star Is Born" (with Barbra Streisand), for which he received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor, and "Flashpoint" in 1984 (directed by William Tannen).
At the peak of his box-office power, Kristofferson turned down William Friedkin's "Sorcerer" (1977) and the romantic war film "Hanover Street" '.
Despite his success with Streisand, Kristofferson's solo musical career headed downward with his non-charting ninth album, "Shake Hands with the Devil".
His next film "Freedom Road" did not earn a theatrical release in the U.S.
In Kristofferson's next film he was cast in the lead role as the enigmatic Sheriff James Averill in Michael Cimino's bleak and sprawling anti-Western "Heaven's Gate".
Despite being a scandalous studio-bankrupting and industry-changing failure at the time, the film gained critical recognition in subsequent years.
In 1986, he starred in "The Last Days of Frank and Jesse James" with Johnny Cash.
In 1989, he was the male lead in the film "Millennium" with Cheryl Ladd.
In 1996, he earned a supporting role as Charlie Wade, a corrupt South Texas sheriff in John Sayles's "Lone Star", a film nominated for an Oscar for Best Screenplay.
In 1998, he took a role in the film "Blade", playing alongside Wesley Snipes as Blade's mentor Abraham Whistler.
He reprised the role in "Blade II" (2002) and again in "" (2004).

He was in the 2001 version of "Planet of the Apes".
He has also played the title character "Yohan" as an old man in the Norwegian film "Yohan-the Children Wanderer".
He co-starred in the 2011 film "Dolphin Tale" and its 2014 sequel, "Dolphin Tale 2".
In 2012, Kristofferson was in "Joyful Noise" with longtime friend, Dolly Parton.
In 2013, Kristofferson co-starred in "The Motel Life", as well as "Angels Sing" with Willie Nelson and Lyle Lovett.
========,3,Mid-career.
After his singing success in the early 70s, Kristofferson met singer Rita Coolidge.
They married in 1973 and released an album titled "Full Moon", another success buoyed by numerous hit singles and Grammy nominations.
However, his fifth album, "Spooky Lady's Sideshow", released in 1974, was a commercial failure, setting the trend for most of the rest of his career.
Artists such as Ronnie Milsap and Johnny Duncan continued to record Kristofferson's material with much success, but his distinctively rough voice and anti-pop sound kept his own audience to a minimum.
Meanwhile, more artists took his songs to the top of the charts, including Willie Nelson, whose 1979 LP release of "(Willie Nelson) Sings Kristofferson" reached #5 on the U.S. Country Music chart and certified Platinum in the U.S.
In 1979, Kris Kristofferson traveled to Havana, Cuba, to participate in the historic Havana Jam festival that took place between March 2‚Äì4, alongside Rita Coolidge, Stephen Stills, the CBS Jazz All-Stars, the Trio of Doom, Fania All-Stars, Billy Swan, Bonnie Bramlett, Mike Finnegan, Weather Report, and Billy Joel, plus an array of Cuban artists such as Irakere, Pacho Alonso, Tata G√ºines, and Orquesta Arag√≥n.
His performance is captured on Ernesto Juan Castellanos's documentary "Havana Jam '79".

========,3,Later work.

He married again, to Lisa Meyers, and concentrated on films for a time, appearing in "The Lost Honor of Kathryn Beck", "Flashpoint", and "Songwriter", the last of which also starred Willie Nelson.
Kristofferson was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score.
"Music from Songwriter" (an album of duets between Nelson and Kristofferson) was a massive country success.
Nelson and Kristofferson continued their partnership, and added Waylon Jennings and Johnny Cash to form the supergroup The Highwaymen.
Their first album, "Highwayman," was a huge success, and the supergroup continued working together for a time.
The single from the album, also entitled "Highwayman, and especially written for them by tunesmith Jimmy Webb," was awarded the ACM's single of the year in 1985.
In 1985, Kristofferson starred in "Trouble in Mind" and released "Repossessed", a politically aware album that was a country success, particularly "They Killed Him" (also performed by Bob Dylan), a tribute to his heroes, including Martin Luther King, Jr., Jesus, and Mahatma Gandhi.
Kristofferson also appeared in "Amerika" at about the same time, a miniseries that attempted to depict life in America under Soviet control.
In spite of the success of "Highwayman 2" in 1990, Kristofferson's solo recording career slipped significantly in the early 1990s, though he continued to record successfully with the Highwaymen.
"Lone Star" (1996 film by John Sayles) reinvigorated Kristofferson's acting career, and he soon appeared in "Blade", "Blade II", "", "A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries", "Fire Down Below", Tim Burton's remake of "Planet of the Apes", "Chelsea Walls", "Payback", "The Jacket", and "Fast Food Nation".

Kristofferson had always denied having a good voice, and has said that as he's aged, what quality it might once have had commenced to decay.
In December 2009, it was announced that Kristofferson would be portraying Joe in the upcoming album "Ghost Brothers of Darkland County", a collaboration between rock singer John Mellencamp and novelist Stephen King.
