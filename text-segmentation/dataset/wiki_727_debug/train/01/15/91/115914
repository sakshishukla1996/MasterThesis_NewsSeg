Reed Plantation was first settled in the early 1830s by four families, Clifford, Rollins, Prouty, and Plummer.
The matriarchs of these families were four Spaulding sisters, Edith Clifford, Susan Spaulding, Lavinia Prouty, and Phoebe Plummer.
They were the daughters of Seth Spaulding of the Dover-Foxcroft area.
Many of their descendants still live in Reed or the village of Wytopitlock today.
