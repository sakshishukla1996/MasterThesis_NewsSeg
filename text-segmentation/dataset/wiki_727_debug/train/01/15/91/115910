========,2,History.
Oxbow was first settled in 1842 by Elias and Samuel Hayden, who had previously resided in Somerset County, Maine.
More settlers came to set up farms and mills, which spurred residents to incorporate as Oxbow Plantation in 1870.
In 1994, an attempt to deorganize was defeated by a vote of 21-9.
In November 2015, Oxbow residents voted unanimously to deorganize, which was largely driven by a need to lower property tax rates.
In March 2016, a panel of the Maine Legislature voted to accept the town's attempt to deorganize.
In November 2016, town residents voted 38-1 to move forward with deorganization.
In order to do so, Oxbow must liquidate the town's property including a boat launch on the Aroostook River and a community center.
