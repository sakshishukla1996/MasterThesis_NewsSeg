========,2,Amish community.
There is an Amish community in Smyrna, that began as one of the "Christian Communities" of Elmo Stoll in 1996.
From the beginning most members had an Amish background, but some came from other plain communities while others had no plain background.
Soon after the early death of Elmo Stoll in 1998, the "Christian Communities" began to disband.
The community in Smyrna lost most of his members, who had no plain background and then decided to seek fellowship with an Michigan Churches of the Old Order Amish.
The Amish in Smyrna are said to be more open to outsiders than other Amish communities.
They hold most of their church services in English.
They are in fellowship with the Maine Amish in Unity and Hodgdon.
Contrary to most other Amish the Amish men in Smyrna wear moustaches along with long beards, which reflects their "Christian Communities" history.
In 2005 the Amish community consisted of around 100 people.
