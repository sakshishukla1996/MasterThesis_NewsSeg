Harlan is a home rule-class city in and the county seat of Harlan County, Kentucky, United States.

Harlan is one of three Kentucky county seats to share its name with its county, the others being Greenup and Henderson.
========,2,History.
Harlan was first settled by Samuel and Chloe Howard in 1796.
Upon the founding of Harlan County (named for Kentucky pioneer Silas Harlan) in 1819, the Howards donated of land to serve as the county seat.
The community there was already known as "Mount Pleasant", apparently owing to a nearby Indian mound.
A post office was established on September 19, 1828, but called "Harlan Court House" due to another Mt.
Pleasant preempting that name.
During the Civil War, Confederate raiders under Gen. Humphrey Marshall occupied the town; the local postmaster renamed the community "Spurlock" after himself; and, in October 1863, the courthouse was burnt down in reprisal for the Union destruction of the courthouse in Lee County, Virginia.
In 1865, the post office was renamed "Harlan" and, although the community was formally incorporated by the state assembly as "Mount Pleasant" on April 15, 1884, the town was already usually called "Harlan Court House" or "Harlan Town" by its inhabitants.
The city's terms of incorporation were amended to change the name to "Harlan" on March 13, 1912.
One year before, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad had arrived in Harlan and prompted massive growth.
The city had initially expanded east along the Clover Fork; after World War II, it also expanded south along Martin's Fork.
Harlan is the site of a criminal case in which a man, Condy Dabney, was convicted in 1924 of murdering a person who was later found alive.
A flood in 1977 prompted federal aid that diverted the Clover Fork into man-made tunnels under Ivy Hill in 1989.
In the 1990s, a flood wall was completed on the city's west side along the four-lane bypass U.S. Route 421.
