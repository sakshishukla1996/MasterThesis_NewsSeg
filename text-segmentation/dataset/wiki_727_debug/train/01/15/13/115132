South Shore was first settled in 1890 by the Fullerton, Warnock, and the Morton families from the nearby Tygarts Valley.
Significant development occurred after the coming of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad and George D. Winn's ferry to Portsmouth, Ohio, in the 1890s.
Winn began to petition for a post office in 1893, and on July 21 the post office was established as "Fullerton", after his brothers Harvey and Harrison Fullerton.
The town was incorporated for a short period during 1919.
In 1895, the Taylor brickyard was established near Fullerton by Clyde King and became the area's top employer.
