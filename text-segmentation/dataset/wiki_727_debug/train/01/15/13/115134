In 1823, William Shreve and his family had built a steam furnace nearby, and they named their settlement (the) "Old Steam Furnace".
Because neither of the settlements had an acceptable name for a post office, the post office was named "Oil Works" after a local factory that made kerosene.
Although the Oil Works post office was established on January 14, 1864, it was closed in 1871.
On February 28, 1876, the post office was reestablished as "Wurtland", named after George and Samuel Grandin Wurts who had founded the nearby Pennsylvania and Laurel Furnaces in 1848.
