Supported by the Southern Baptist Church, Coleman College at its peak owned some , of which ten were devoted to educational purposes.
There were eight buildings which included classrooms, auditorium, dormitories, and an administrative building.
The college offered a choir, glee club, and intercollegiate athletics.
Nicknamed the Bulldogs, Coleman College's chief athletic rival was the historically black Grambling College Tigers in Grambling in Lincoln Parish, subsequently Grambling State University.
Enrollment at Coleman reached as high as four hundred in some years.
The college closed in Gibsland in 1944.
Among its graduates were the first president of Southern University in Baton Rouge, Dr. J. S. Clark, and Ada Bell Lewis Coleman.

The LNW interchanges on both ends of the line: with the Union Pacific (former St. Louis Southwestern) in McNeil; and with Kansas City Southern (former MidSouth, ICG) at Gibsland.
For many years the road was well-known among railfans for its unusual stable of F7 "covered wagons"—unusual motive power of choice for a backwoods southern shortline.
In the early 1990s, the F units were sold off to various places, gradually replaced by Geeps from various locations.
