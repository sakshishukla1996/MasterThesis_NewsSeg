========,2,History.
New Haven was founded as "Pottenger's Landing" in 1781, but was renamed New Haven in 1819 by Samuel Pottenger Jr. for the Connecticut town.
It was incorporated as a city in 1839, with Silvester Johnson as the first elected city manager.
In 1856, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad reached the town, virtually ending what had been a thriving flat-boating trade on the Rolling Fork River.
The railroad purchased Pottenger's original landing, and it was demolished to make room for the roadbed and a bridge.
At the beginning of the Civil War, Kentucky declared its neutrality.
Nevertheless, in late 1861 the Union Army occupied New Haven, and a training camp was established by the 15th Kentucky Infantry Regiment, later to be used by the 28th Kentucky Infantry Regiment.
The New Haven railhead and post office were also used to support Camp Wickliffe, a Union infantry training camp in neighboring LaRue County.
In mid-September 1862, General Braxton Bragg's Confederate troops marched through New Haven during its Kentucky Campaign, leaving the 3rd Georgia Cavalry Regiment to occupy the town, guarding the railroad bridge and the turnpike bridge over the Rolling Fork River.
On September 26, a Union cavalry column, consisting the 2nd Indiana Cavalry, 1st Kentucky Cavalry, and 3rd Kentucky Cavalry, attacked the town, capturing almost the entire 3rd Georgia as well as the military patients being treated in a hospital set up at the Methodist Church.
The 78th Illinois Infantry occupied the town in October, and were assigned the task of guarding the L&N railroad lines in the area.
Blockhouses were built at all major bridges across the Rolling Fork River, including New Haven, which became the regiment's headquarters.
During Morgan's Christmas Raid of 1862, the defenses at New Haven were attacked on the morning of December 30 by three companies of the Confederate 9th Kentucky Cavalry, aided by a single 12-punder Mountain Howitzer.
After 90 minutes of contact, the Confederates broke off the attack, having inflicted no damage to the fort but suffering about 5 to 7 of their men men wounded.
However, the town suffered from several stray shells that damaged both of New Haven's taverns.
The fortifications were occupied by different units until early 1864, but were burned to the ground by Henry C. Magruder's Confederate small band of guerillas in September 1864.
From mid-1864 until the end of the war, New Haven acted as a base for a number of anti-guerilla units, the most famous being led by Major Cyrus J. Wilson.
After the Civil War, New Haven was well known as a center for the liquor trade, there being a large number of distilleries within a short distance.
This bustling town had grown to a population of over 1200 by 1910, but the population fell quickly after the advent of Prohibition in 1919.
