========,2,History.
The Florence area was originally known as Crossroads, because of the convergence of several roads from Burlington and Union at Ridge Road (now U.S. 25).
By 1821, the area was known as Maddentown for Thomas Madden, a Covington attorney who owned a farm on the Burlington Pike.
When Madden moved away, the area became known as Connersville in 1828 for Jacob Conner, a settler who assumed responsibility for the growing town.
The town was finally renamed to Florence owing to another Connersville in Harrison County.
The name presumably is a transfer from Florence, Italy, but the specific etymology is unclear.
It was incorporated on January 27, 1830, and grew quickly after the completion of the Covington-Lexington Turnpike in 1836.

========,2,Landmarks.
Florence is well known in surrounding cities for a water tower visible from I-71/I-75 that reads "Florence Y'all".
Originally the tower advertised the up-and-coming Florence Mall, as part of an agreement by the mall developers who donated the land for the tower.
However, because the mall was not built yet, the tower violated highway regulations, and the city was forced to change it within a short deadline.
Rather than repaint the entire tower, they simply painted over the two vertical lines of the "M" to create a "Y".
The intent was to change it back when the mall was built, but the local residents liked the tower's new proclamation, so the city decided to leave it as it was.
