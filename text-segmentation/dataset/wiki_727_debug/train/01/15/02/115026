========,2,History.
Pineville is one of the oldest settlements in Kentucky, located at the crossing of the Cumberland River by the Wilderness Road.
It was established as Cumberland Ford in 1781 and formed part of Gov.
Isaac Shelby's land tracts.
When Bell County was formed in 1867, Cumberland Ford was formally laid off; local landowner J.J. Gibson's 1869 land grant permitted it to be selected as the county seat, but the courthouse was not completed until 1871.
The settlement was renamed "Pineville" in 1870 and formally incorporated in 1873.
One of the earliest branches of the Sojourner Truth Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) was formed in Pineville in 1906 with fifteen members - at the time, it was affiliated with the white women's branch of the Kentucky WCTU.
Its riverside location has made it subject to flooding, including a devastating incident on April 4, 1977, in which a floodwall built in 1952 was overwhelmed and 200 houses were destroyed or damaged.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers upgraded the floodwall in 1988.
The economy is dependent on the coal mining industry, local family owned businesses and on tourism.

Thanks to works done by the community organization Main Street Pineville, the town is working on revitalizing downtown Pineville to its historical roots.

The first Kentucky Mountain Laurel Festival was presented in 1931 at the suggestion of Ms. Annie Walker Burns a descendent of Dr. Thomas Walker, the first European to enter Kentucky and who, along with a party of explorers, visited the present site of Pineville in 1750.
Ms. Burns was captivated by the history and beauty surrounding Pineville and appealed to Governor Flem D. Sampson of Barbourville to initiate some type of event to honor Dr. Walker.
She gained the support of other influential Bell Countians, and the 1931 Festival was staged at Clear Creek Springs on June fourth.
