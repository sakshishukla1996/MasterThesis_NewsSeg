========,2,History.
In the early 19th century, the site of the present city was the junction of the Louisville and Nashville Pike with spur roads to Glasgow and Bardstown.
By 1827, a stagecoach relay station had developed into a settlement with a post office named Three Forks.
The postmaster William Bell owned a plantation nearby, with a prominent tavern, which led to the community also being known as Bell's Station.
In 1859, the mainline of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad reached the plantation, and in 1863 the Glasgow spur was completed.
The community was then known as Glasgow Junction after the L&N Depot, which also served as the junction between the mainline and the Mammoth Cave Railroad.
There was a close relationship between Mammoth Cave and Diamond Cave (Diamond Caverns) for years.
Books and cave brochures would describe both caves.
Beginning in 1880, the Mammoth Cave Railroad tracks were laid just west of Diamond Cave.
When the line finally opened in 1886, Diamond was one of the primary stops on the railroad.
Excursions were available to see Diamond and Mammoth Caves on the same day, and still return to Glasgow Junction in time to catch through trains to Louisville or Nashville.
Mammoth Cave Railroad stops also served two nearby caves opened by Larkin Proctor, Long Cave, commercialized as Grand Avenue Caverns, and Proctor Cave.
The city was platted and formally incorporated under that name in 1871.
In 1938, the name was changed to Park City to avoid confusion with Glasgow.
