========,1,preface.
The Boeing B-47 Stratojet (company Model 450) was an American long range, six-engine, turbojet-powered strategic bomber designed to fly at high subsonic speed and at high altitude to avoid enemy interceptor aircraft.
The B-47's primary mission was to drop nuclear bombs on the Soviet Union.
With its engines carried in nacelles under the swept wing, the B-47 was a major innovation in post-World War II combat jet design, and contributed to the development of modern jet airliners.
The B-47 entered service with the United States Air Force's Strategic Air Command (SAC) in 1951.
It never saw combat as a bomber, but was a mainstay of SAC's bomber strength during the late 1950s and early 1960s, and remained in use as a bomber until 1965.
It was also adapted to a number of other missions, including photographic reconnaissance, electronic intelligence and weather reconnaissance, remaining in service as a reconnaissance aircraft until 1969 and as a testbed until 1977.
========,2,Development.
========,3,Origins.
The B-47 arose from an informal 1943 requirement for a jet-powered reconnaissance bomber, drawn up by the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) to prompt manufacturers to start research into jet bombers.
Boeing was among several companies that responded to this request; its initial design, the Model 424, was basically a scaled-down version of the piston-engined B-29 Superfortress equipped with four jet engines.
In 1944 this initial concept evolved into a formal request-for-proposal to design a new bomber with a maximum speed of , a cruise speed of , a range of and a service ceiling of .
In December 1944, North American Aviation, the Convair Corp., Boeing and the Glenn Martin Company submitted proposals for the new long-range jet bomber.
Wind tunnel testing had shown that the drag from the engine installation of the Model 424 was too high, so Boeing's entry was a revised design, the Model 432, with the four engines buried in the forward fuselage.
The USAAF awarded study contracts to all four companies, requiring that North American and Convair concentrate on four-engined designs (to become B-45 and XB-46), while Boeing and Martin were to build six-engined aircraft (the B-47 and XB-48).
The powerplant was to be General Electric's new TG-180 turbojet engine.
========,3,Swept wings.
In May 1945, the von Kármán mission of the Army Air Forces inspected the secret German aeronautics laboratory near Braunschweig.
On von Kármán's team was the eminent chief of the technical staff at Boeing, George S. Schairer.
He had heard about the controversial swept-wing theory of R. T. Jones at Langley, but seeing models of swept-wing aircraft and extensive supersonic wind-tunnel data generated by the Germans, the concept was decisively confirmed.
He wired his home office: "Stop the bomber design", and changed the design of the B-47 wing.
Analysis work by Boeing engineer Vic Ganzer suggested an optimum sweepback angle of about 35 degrees.
Boeing's aeronautical engineers modified their Model 432 design to include swept wings and tail, resulting in the "Model 448", which was presented to the USAAF in September 1945.
The Model 448 retained its four TG-180 jet engines in its forward fuselage, with two more TG-180s in the rear fuselage.
The flush-mounted air intakes for the rear engines were inadequate, while the USAAF disliked the installation of engines within the fuselage, considering it a fire hazard.
The engines were moved out to streamlined pods (pylon mounted) under the wings, leading to the next iteration, the "Model 450", which featured two TG-180s in a twin pod mounted on a pylon about a third of the way outboard on each wing, plus another engine at each wingtip.
The Army Air Force liked this new configuration, and so Boeing's team of engineers continued to refine it, with the outer engines being moved further inboard, to about 3/4 of the wingspan.
The thin wings provided no room into which wheels could be retracted, so a "bicycle landing gear" was chosen, with the two main gear assemblies arranged in a tandem configuration and outrigger struts fitted to the inboard engine pods.
As the landing gear arrangement made rotation (i.e., lifting the nose during takeoff) impossible, the landing gear was designed so that the aircraft rested on the ground at the proper angle for takeoff.
========,3,USAAF selects Boeing.
The USAAF was very pleased with the refined Model 450 design, and in April 1946, the service ordered two prototypes, to be designated "XB-47".
Assembly began in June 1947.
The first XB-47 was rolled out on 12 September 1947, a few days before the USAAF became a separate service, the U.S. Air Force, on 18 September 1947.
The XB-47 prototype flew its first flight on 17 December 1947 (the anniversary of the Wright Brothers' first four flights on 17 December 1903), with the test pilots Robert Robbins and Scott Osler at the controls of the aircraft.
It flew from Boeing Field in Seattle to the Moses Lake Airfield in central Washington state, in a flight that lasted just 27 minutes, with no major problems.
Robbins had to pull up the flaps with the "emergency hot wire system", and the "engine fire" warning indicators were falsely lit.
Robbins reported that the flight characteristics of the aircraft were good.
In Feb. 1949, Russ Schleeh and Joe Howell "broke all coast-to-coast speed records" flying from Moses Lake Air Force Base to Andrews Air Force Base.
They averaged 607.8 miles per hour.
During early tests of the XB-47 prototype, the canopy came off at high speed, killing pilot Scott Osler.
The copilot safely landed the aircraft.
This resulted in a canopy redesign, and the hiring of pilot Tex Johnston as chief test pilot.
========,3,Second X-model.
The second XB-47 (46-066) prototype first took to the air on 21 July 1948 and following its delivery to the USAF in December of that year, it served as a flying test bed until its retirement in 1954.
Its final destination was Chanute AFB where it was used as a maintenance and familiarization aircraft.
This second prototype was equipped with much more powerful General Electric J47-GE-3 turbojets with of static thrust each.
The J47 or "TG-190" was a redesigned version of the TG-180/J35.
The first XB-47 prototype was later retrofitted with these engines.
Flight testing of the prototypes was particularly careful and methodical, since the design was new in so many ways.
The prototypes initially suffered from "Dutch roll", an instability that caused the aircraft to weave in widening "S" turns.
This problem was remedied by the addition of a "yaw damper" control system that applied rudder automatically to damp out the weaving motion.
The prototypes also had a tendency to pitch up.
This problem was solved by adding small vanes called "vortex generators" onto the wings that caused turbulence to prevent airflow separation.
Boeing test pilot Rob Robbins had originally been skeptical about the XB-47, saying that before the initial flight he had prayed, "Oh God, please help me through the next two hours."
The aircraft was "considered to be a radical airplane."
Robbins soon realized that he had an extraordinary aircraft.
Chuck Yeager flew the XB-47 later in its development cycle and years later noted that the aircraft was so aerodynamically clean that he had difficulty putting it down on the Edwards lakebed.
Both XB-47 prototypes were test flown at Edwards AFB, however the number one XB-47 (46-065) was disassembled and eventually scrapped by the Air Force in 1954, thus making the number two prototype (46-066) the sole surviving XB-47.
Upon retirement, XB-47 (46-066) was restored and placed on display at the Octave Chanute Aerospace Museum in Rantoul, Illinois where it remained on display until the museum announced it was closing its doors due to financial difficulties in April 2015.
In late 2015, the Flight Test Historical Foundation began fundraising efforts to purchase XB-47 (46-066) for relocation to the Flight Test Museum at Edwards AFB.
The purchase was completed in August 2016 and on September 21, 2016 the aircraft arrived at Edwards AFB for reassembly, restoration and eventual display at the Flight Test Museum.
========,3,X-model competitions.
By mid-1948, the Air Force's bomber competition had already been through one iteration, pitting the North American XB-45 against the Convair XB-46.
The North American design won that round of the competition; as an interim measure, the USAF decided to put the North American bomber into production on a limited basis as the B-45 Tornado.
The expectation was that B-45 production would be terminated if either of the remaining two designs in the competition, the Boeing XB-47 and the Martin XB-48, proved superior.
It is sometimes claimed that the final production decision was made as a result of Boeing president Bill Allen inviting USAF General K.B.
Wolfe, in charge of bomber production, for a ride on the XB-47.
A formal contract for 10 aircraft was signed on 3 September 1948.
========,2,Design.
========,3,Overview.
The XB-47, which looked unlike any contemporary bomber, was described by some observers as a "sleek, beautiful outcome that was highly advanced".
The 35-degree swept wings were shoulder-mounted, with the twin inboard turbojet engines mounted in neat pods, and the outboard engines tacked under the wings short of the wingtips.
With the exception of a change from the shoulder wing configuration to being under the fuselage and cockpit seating to side-by-side, most future airliners would use a similar configuration, with the engines mounted in underwing pylons.
This arrangement would reduce the bending moment at the wing roots, saving structural weight.
The mass of the engines also acted as counter-flutter weights.
The wing airfoil was identified by Boeing as the BAC 145, but this was actually the NACA 64A(.225)12 mod airfoil.
The wing's flexibility was a concern, as it could flex as much as at the tip, and major effort was expended to ensure that flight control could be maintained as the wing moved up and down.
As it turned out, most of the worries proved unfounded.
The aircraft's maximum speed was limited to to avoid control reversal, where aileron inputs by the pilot would cause the wings to twist and produce a roll in the opposite direction to that desired by the pilot.
The wings were fitted with a set of Fowler flaps that extended well behind the wing, to enhance lift at slow speeds.
The XB-47 was designed to carry a crew of three in a pressurized forward compartment: a pilot and copilot, in tandem, in a long fighter-style bubble canopy, and a navigator/bombardier in a compartment in the nose.
The copilot doubled as tail gunner (using a remotely controlled, radar-directed tail gun), and the navigator as bombardier.
The bubble canopy could pitch up and slide backward, but as the cockpit was high off the ground, crew entrance was through a door and ladder on the underside of the nose.
The extreme front of the nose was initially glazed to allow visual navigation and bomb sighting, but this was quickly and increasingly faired over with metal.
Almost all production versions had a solid metal nose with no windows.
A K-series bombsight provided integrated radar navigation and visual navigation, with the optical portion extending through the nose of the aircraft in a small dome.
========,3,Engines and performance.
The first prototypes were fitted with General Electric J35 turbojets, the production version of the TG-180, with of thrust.
Early jet engines did not develop good thrust at low speeds, so to help a heavily loaded bomber take off, the XB-47 prototype had provisions for fitting 18 solid-fuel rocket-assisted takeoff (RATO) rockets with of static thrust each.
Fittings for nine such units were built into each side of the rear fuselage, arranged in three rows of three bottles.
The performance of the Model 450 design was projected to be so good that the bomber would be as fast as fighters then on the drawing board, and so the only defensive armament was to be a tail turret with two .50 in (12.7 mm) AN/M2 Browning machine guns, which would in principle be directed by an automatic fire-control system.
The two XB-47s were not fitted with the tail turrets as they were engineering and flight test aircraft; indeed, the prototypes had no combat equipment at all.
The one problem with this early design was that at higher altitudes where the pure turbojet engines could produce decent fuel economy, the wing was very compromised.
At the top of the B-47's envelope, about , the B-47 was in "coffin corner".
That means that at this level, which produced the most range at most weights due to fuel consumption, there was an envelope of between maximum mach and stall speed.
Since this airplane had a rudimentary autopilot at best, it meant that if the B-47 was going to cross the Atlantic Ocean, it had to be flown this high and the pilot had to leave the autopilot OFF and needed to spend up to eight hours staring at the airspeed and manipulating the throttles in order to not fall from the sky.
To put this in perspective, a modern Boeing 757 has over of difference at even a very heavy weight at .
Fuel capacity was enormous, at , more than triple the on the B-29 Superfortress.
That meant that maintaining fuel trim to ensure a stable center of gravity in flight would be a very critical copilot duty.
The total bombload capacity was to be .
Production aircraft were to be equipped with state-of-the-art electronics for navigation, bombing, countermeasures, and turret fire control.
========,3,Drag chutes.
The aircraft was so aerodynamically slick that rapid descent ("penetration") from high cruise altitude to the landing pattern required dragging the deployed rear landing gear.
The relatively high wing loading (weight/wing area) required a high landing speed of .
To shorten the landing roll, Air Force test pilot Major Guy Townsend promoted the addition of a German-invented "ribbon" drag chute (thrust reversers had not then been developed).
For the same reason, the B-47 was the first mass-produced aircraft to be equipped with an anti-skid braking system.
A related problem was that the aircraft's engines would have to be throttled down on landing approach.
Since it could take as long as 20 seconds to throttle them back up to full power, the big bomber could not easily do a "touch and go" momentary landing.
A 16-foot "approach chute" (drogue parachute) provided aerodynamic drag so that the aircraft could be flown at approach speeds with the engines throttled at ready-to-spool-up medium power.
On the ground, the pilots used the 32-foot "brake chute".
The brake chute could be deployed to stop the aircraft from "porpoising", or bouncing, after a hard landing on the front nose gear.
Training typically included an hour of dragging this chute around the landing pattern for multiple practice landings.
========,2,Operational history.
========,3,Early years.
The USAF Strategic Air Command operated B-47 Stratojets (B-47s, EB-47s, RB-47s and YRB-47s) from 1951 through 1965.
When B-47s began to be delivered to the Air Force, most crews were excited about getting their hands on the hot new bomber, an aircraft whose performance was closer to that of jet fighters of the period than SAC's extant B-36 Peacemaker bomber.
The B-47 was so fast that in the early days the aircraft set records with ease.
The aircraft handled well in flight, with a fighter-like light touch to the controls.
The large bubble canopy for the pilot and co-pilot enhanced the fighter-like feel of the aircraft with improved vision, but the design would also cause variations in internal temperatures for the three-man crew.
The three man crew consisted of the aircraft commander, copilot, and a navigator/bombardier or a crew chief.
The B-47 was a maintenance "hog", so as a "valuable member of the ground crews, the crew chief was eligible for $50.00 per month flight pay if they flew the customary 4 hours a month required by regulations."
It took the Air Force until 1953 to turn the B-47 into an operational aircraft.
The aircraft was sluggish on takeoff and too fast on landings, a very unpleasant combination.
If the pilot landed at the wrong angle, the B-47 would "porpoise", bouncing fore-and-aft.
If the pilot did not lift off for another go-around, instability would quickly cause the bomber to skid onto one wing and cartwheel.
Because the wings and surfaces were flexible and bent in flight, low altitude speed restrictions were necessary to ensure effective flight control.
Improved training led to a good safety record, and few crews felt the aircraft was unsafe or too demanding, but apparently there were some aircrews who had little affection for the B-47.
Crew workload was high, with only three officer crew members to keep the B-47 flying right.
Boeing's B-52 Stratofortress, in contrast, generally had six crewmen, five officers and one enlisted, with far more internal cabin space.
========,3,Training and problems.
The B-47's reliability and serviceability were regarded as good.
The only major problem was poor avionics reliability, normal in this environment given the vacuum tube technology at the time, and the need to place some equipment outside the pressurized crew compartment.
Much work was done to improve avionics reliability, but they remained problematic throughout the B-47's operational life.
Starting in 1950, several models of the B-47 included a fuel tank inerting system, in which dry ice was sublimed into carbon dioxide vapor while the fuel pumps operated or while the in-flight refueling system was in use.
The carbon dioxide was then pumped into the fuel tanks and the rest of the fuel system, ensuring that the amount of oxygen in the fuel system was low, reducing the probability of an explosion.
Ten carbon dioxide tanks and heaters were involved.
The system was implemented largely to reduce risks from static electricity discharges occurring during in-flight refueling.
Initial mission profiles included the loft bombing of nuclear weapons.
As the training for this imposes repeated high stress on the aircraft, the airframe lifetime would have been severely limited by metal fatigue, and this maneuver was eliminated.
========,3,Prime years.
An XB-47 was flown in the 1951 Operation Greenhouse nuclear weapons testing.
This was followed by a B-47B being flown in the 1954 Operation Ivy and the 1955 Operation Castle.
A B-47E was then flown in the 1956 Operation Redwing.
"Reflex" missions proved the long-endurance (eighteen hours) and long range capability of the B-47 and aircrews.
These were "simulated strike missions against the then Soviet enemy."
Three B-47s flew cross country from March Air Force Base to the Philadelphia International Airport as participants in the 1955 Labor Day race.
In the 1956 event, three B-47s participated in the G.E.
Trophy race for Jet Bombers, flying from Kindley Field, Bermuda, to Oklahoma City.
One of these set a course speed record of 601.187 MPH.
By 1956, the U.S. Air Force had 28 wings of B-47 bombers and five wings of RB-47 reconnaissance aircraft.
The bombers were the first line of America's strategic nuclear deterrent, often operating from forward bases in the UK, Morocco, Spain, Alaska, Greenland and Guam.
B-47s were often set up on "one-third" alert, with a third of the operational aircraft available sitting on hardstands or an alert ramp adjacent to the runway, loaded with fuel and nuclear weapons, crews on standby, ready to attack the USSR at short notice.
Crews were also trained to perform "Minimum Interval Take Offs (MITO)", with one bomber following the other into the air at intervals of as little as 15 seconds, to launch all bombers as fast as possible.
MITO could be hazardous, as the bombers left wing tip vortices and general turbulence behind them, and with first generation turbojet engines with water-injection systems, they also created dense black smoke.
The B-47 was the backbone of SAC into 1959, when the B-52 began to assume nuclear alert duties and the number of B-47 bomber wings started to be reduced.
B-47 production ceased in 1957, though modifications and rebuilds continued after that.
Operational practice for B-47 bomber operations during this time went from high altitude bombing to low altitude strike, which was judged more likely to penetrate Soviet defenses.
Bomber crews were trained in "pop-up" attacks, coming in at low level at and then climbing abruptly near the target before releasing a nuclear weapon.
========,3,Later years.
Stress and fatigue incurred in low-altitude operations led to a number of wing failures and crashes and an extensive refit program was begun in 1958 to strengthen the wing mountings.
The program was known as "Milk Bottle", named after the big connecting pins that were replaced in the wing roots.
One of the more notable mishaps involving a B-47 occurred on 5 February 1958 near Savannah, Georgia, in the so-called 1958 Tybee Island B-47 crash.
A B-47 based out of Homestead AFB, Florida, was engaged in a simulated combat exercise against an F-86 fighter.
As was the practice at the time, the B-47 was carrying a single Mark 15 nuclear bomb, without its core.
During this exercise, the F-86 collided with the B-47.
The F-86 pilot ejected and the fighter crashed; the B-47 suffered substantial damage, including loss of power in one outboard jet engine.
After three unsuccessful landing attempts at Hunter Air Force Base, the bomber pilot had to "safe" soft drop the Mark 15 weapon off the coast of Savannah, Georgia near Tybee Island.
The bomb was jettisoned and the aircraft landed safely.
An extensive nine-month search was mounted for the unarmed bomb, but proved futile.
In 1963 the Kennedy administration offered 24 B-47E bombers as an interim Canberra Mk 20 replacement for Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), pending delivery of the much delayed F-111C aircraft.
Three B-47E aircraft flew to Australia for demonstration purposes but RAAF declined the offer as technically outdated and too resource-intensive.
Final phaseout of B-47 bomber wings began in 1963, and the last bombers were out of service with SAC by 1966.
The last USAF operational aircraft, WB-47Es assigned to the Air Weather Service, were withdrawn from use in September 1969.
Shortly before, a B-47E number 53-2280 was used as a testbed for crucial early test of the newly developed fly-by-wire system.
The U.S. Navy kept specialized EB-47E test aircraft bailed from USAF inventory in occasional use in support of the Fleet Electronic Warfare Systems Group (FEWSG) until December 1977 when they were replaced by government owned/contractor operated (GOCO) NKC-135 Stratotanker aircraft also loaned from USAF inventory.
The final recorded flight of a B-47 was on 17 June 1986, when a B-47E was restored to flight-worthy condition for a one-time ferry flight.
This aircraft was flown from Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, California, to Castle Air Force Base, California, for static display at the Castle Air Museum where it still resides.
========,3,Reconnaissance.
The only B-47s to see anything that resembled combat were the aerial reconnaissance variants.
The first overflight of Soviet territory with a B-47B, equipped "with special radar and photographic cameras installed in the bomb bay," took place on 15 October 1952, when one flying out of Alaska overflew Soviet airfields in Northeastern Siberia.
RB-47s operated from almost every airfield that gave them access to the USSR, and they often probed Soviet airspace.
On occasion, their pilots were caught in situations from which they escaped mostly through speed and evasion.
At least five of these aircraft were fired on, and three were shot down.
The RB-47s fired back with their tail turrets, although it is uncertain if they scored any kills.
Nonetheless, these were the only shots fired in anger by any B-47.
On 8 May 1954, after a top secret reconnaissance mission in the Kola Peninsula, a 4th Air Division 91 Strategic Reconnaissance Wing RB-47E reconnaissance aircraft, with Harold Austin at the controls, flew over the Soviet Union.
The RB-47E was flying at high altitude, out of reach of MiG-15s, but unknown to USAF intelligence some MiG-17s had been stationed in the area that were able to intercept the intruder.
The RB-47E was chased by several Soviet MiG-17 fighters attempting to destroy the aircraft with their guns over Soviet and Finnish airspace.
Although sustaining damage, the RB-47E managed to escape over Sweden back to its home base at RAF Fairford, Gloucestershire.
Its top speed and combat radius superiority to the Soviet fighter jets were the deciding factors.
The mission marked the first time a jet aircraft equipped with modern aerial photography equipment, K-17 and K-38 cameras, was used for American military reconnaissance over the Soviet Union.
The incident was kept secret by all parties.
Other interceptions resulted in losses.
An RB-47 flying out of Alaska was scouting out the Kamchatka Peninsula on 17 April 1955, when it was intercepted by Soviet MiG-15s in international airspace.
The RB-47 and its crew disappeared.
Between 21 March and 10 May 1956, 16 RB-47Es and five RB-47Hs operating from Thule performed overflights the length of Siberia 156 times under Project HOMERUN.
The Soviets filed an angry complaint with the U.S. government, which attributed the overflights to "navigational difficulties".
MiGs intercepted RB-47s on three separate occasions in the fall of 1958: over the Black Sea on 31 October, over the Baltic on 7 November, and over the Sea of Japan on 17 November.
On 1 July 1960, a PVO Strany MiG-19 shot down an RB-47H (AF Serial No.
53-4281) reconnaissance aircraft in the international airspace over the Barents Sea with four of the crew being killed and two captured by the Soviets, but released in 1961.
The co-pilot reported that the MiG-19 jammed ("whited-out") his MD-4 FCS scope (the radar which aimed the tail guns), rendering the RB-47H defenseless.
The last known confrontation between MiGs and RB-47s took place on 28 April 1965, when an ERB-47H was intercepted by two North Korean MiG-17s over the Sea of Japan.
The MiGs scored hits on the aircraft, but the ERB-47H managed to make it back to Yokota Air Base in Japan with three engines out.
While a few of these aircraft performed special duties during the Vietnam War, such as relaying ELINT data from drones, they were eventually replaced by much more efficient and capable Boeing RC-135 platforms.
The last RB-47H was retired on 29 December 1967.
The final 15 RB-47s, built beginning in December 1955, were fitted with additional equipment, including the AN/APD "side looking airborne radar" (SLAR) system, and gear to sample the air for fallout from nuclear tests.
These models were given the new designation RB-47K.
These were generally used for weather reconnaissance missions, carrying a load of eight "dropsonde" weather sensors that were released at various checkpoints along the aircraft's flight path.
Data radioed back from the dropsondes was logged using equipment operated by the navigator.
The RB-47Ks stayed in service until 1963.
========,2,Variants.
***LIST***.
The first 10 aircraft were designated "B-47A", and were strictly evaluation aircraft.
The first was delivered in December 1950.
The configuration of the B-47As was close to that of the initial XB-47 prototypes.
They were fitted with J47-GE-11 turbojets, offering the same thrust as the earlier J47-GE-3, and they also featured the built-in rocket-assisted-take-off (RATO) bottles.
***LIST***.
Following a series of preliminary contracts for production B-47s, in November 1949, even before the first flight of the B-47A, the Air Force had ordered 87 B-47Bs, the first operational variant of the type.
The first B-47B flew on 26 April 1951.
A total of 399 were built, including eight that were assembled by Lockheed and 10 that were assembled by Douglas, using Boeing-built parts.

========,2,Accidents and incidents.
On 28 February 1955, A crippled B-47 crashed into a Lake Charles, Louisiana, trailer park killing five people.
On 10 March 1956, four B-47s left MacDill Air Force Base in Florida for a non-stop flight to Ben Guerir Air Base in Morocco.
Their first aerial refueling was completed without incident.
After descending through clouds to begin their second refueling, over the Mediterranean Sea at 14,000 feet, one of the four aircraft failed to make contact with the tanker.
Neither the aircraft nor its personnel were ever found.
On 28 March 1956, a B-47 exploded over East Wichita as thousands watched.
It crashed four miles northeast of the city, killing its crew of three.
The office of information services at McConnell Air Force Base said the explosion occurred after takeoff, probably at about 2,000 feet altitude.
Wreckage was strewn along the countryside for several miles as the wings sheared off and the fuselage tumbled to earth.
On 27 July 1956, a B-47 of the 307th Bombardment Wing crashed at RAF Lakenheath killing its crew and causing a near nuclear accident when the aircraft hit a storage igloo containing three MK-6 nuclear weapons.
Although the bombs involved in the accident did not have their fissile cores installed, each of them carried about 8,000 pounds of high explosives as part of their trigger mechanism.
The crash and ensuing fire did not ignite the high explosives and no detonation occurred.
In November 1956, B-47E serial number 51-2421 of the 96th Bombardment Wing, flying from Altus AFB, crashed on a farm near Hobart, Oklahoma, following engine problems.
The aircraft impacted the ground 320 yards west of a barn, skidded into it, and exploded.
Four crewmen were killed in the incident.
On 9 October 1957, B-47 serial number 51-2177A, of the 447th Bomb Squadron, 321st Bomb Wing at Pinecastle Air Force Base suffered wing failure and crashed northwest of Orlando, Florida, and west of Winter Park, Florida, while taking part in a practice demonstration during the annual Strategic Air Command Bombing Navigation and Reconnaissance Competition at Pinecastle AFB.
The wing commander, Colonel Michael Norman Wright McCoy, was killed in the crash.
Pinecastle Air Force Base was later renamed McCoy Air Force Base in his honor.
On 5 February 1958, a B-47 was involved in a mid-air collision with an F-86 fighter over Georgia, known as 1958 Tybee Island mid-air collision.
On 13 March 1958, two B-47s failed on the same date in separate incidents when the lower wing skin failed at approximately the same structural location.
One exploded over southeast Tulsa, Oklahoma, killing one crewman and raining debris over at least 8 square miles.
Two of the three men on the six-engine bomber on a training mission from McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita, Kansas, parachuted to safety.
The third was trapped in the nose of the plane and died.
Thousands of people on the ground heard the explosion and witnessed the plane's disintegration and fall.
On 15 April 1958, a B-47 from Walker Air Force Base in New Mexico, serial number 52-0562, crashed on takeoff at Pease Air Force Base in New Hampshire; all four crewmen were killed.
On 22 November 1958, a B-47B crashed while taking off from Loring Air Force Base in Maine, killing all four crew members on board.
The plane belonged to a unit at McCoy Air Force Base in Orlando, Florida.
The plane was described as having reached two-thirds of the way down the runway, when it veered sharply to the right, eventually crashing 400 feet north of the runway.
On 25 November 1958, a KC-135 Stratotanker of the 42d Air Refueling Squadron crashed on takeoff roughly in the same area as the B-47 three days before.
On 4 April 1959, a B-47, serial number 52-0320, crashed in the Santa Rita mountains, just south of Tucson, Arizona.
At the time—1:20 A.M.—the plane was attempting to land at the adjacent Davis-Monthan Air Force Base.
All three individuals on board at the time were killed.
Crash investigators indicated that a faulty altimeter was a contributing factor in causing the accident.
On 30 December 1959, a B-47B crashed at Torrejón Air Base, Spain, one minute after takeoff.
The four crew members were killed in the crash.

The majority of B-47 scenes were filmed at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, utilizing aircraft from the 306th Bombardment Wing.
The 1957 film "Bombers B-52" features B-47s at Castle Air Force Base, that sported the proud legend, "Home of the B-47" and a fly-over in formation, before moving to focus on the new B-52.
The 1957 film "Bailout at 43,000" features the developments, modifications, and hazards associated with primarily the navigator's downward ejection seats on the B-47s, of which the B-47A, B-47B and B-47E models had several changes made.
The movie has the usual B-47 flight scenes, with unusual shots of test flight downward ejections and recoveries.
