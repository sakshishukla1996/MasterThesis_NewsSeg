Castaño abandoned two interpreters at Kewa Pueblo; he had kidnapped them earlier and brought them with him.

========,3,20th century to present.
Potters of Kewa (Santo Domingo) and Cochiti pueblos have made traditional pots for centuries, developing styles for different purposes and expressing deep beliefs in their designs.
Since the early decades of the 20th century, these pots have been appreciated by a wider audience outside the pueblos.
Continuing to use traditional techniques, in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, potters have also expanded their designs and repertoire in pottery, which has an international market.
