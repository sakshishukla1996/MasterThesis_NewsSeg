The town was named after Henry Beekman, a 17th century land owner.
========,2,History.
The "Beekman" name became attached to the area in 1697, from Henry Beekman, a Kingston native, who had numerous land stakes in Dutchess County.
The town had also been occupied by the Wappinger Indians, before the first European settlers arrived around 1710.
The Beekman Patent, granted to Beekman in 1697, was the second largest land holding in Dutchess County.
In 1737, Beekman became an official precinct, and local government was erected.
1788 was the initial period of establishing towns and counties in the newly independent state of New York, but parts were removed subsequently to form other towns.
Beekman contributed part of its territory to the newer towns of LaGrange (1821) and Union Vale (1827).
Iron ore extraction and smelting were important in the early economy.
The Beekman Patent was a manor until after the Revolution.
Residents could only lease the land and pay rent in wheat, fat fowls and work on roads.
The series "Settlers of the Beekman Patent" chronicles the lives of all residents there in the 18th century.
Beekman saw its first place of worship shortly thereafter, a Lutheran church located off Beach Road, which was frequented by German emigrants.
The Quaker family, well known in the area for being one of the initial settlers, created a meeting house in 1771 in Gardner Hollow, named the "Apoquague Preparative Meeting".
The church attracted most of the population at the time, and those who did not worship there frequented St. Denis Church, a Catholic church, just beyond the East Fishkill border.
========,3,Late 19th century.
Beekman began its "boom" in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as the communities of Sylvan Lake, Beekmanville, and Clove Valley were in the active mining business.

However, the mining industry died out in the late 19th century, with very few remains today.
The most notable one, the "Beekman Furnace", is still intact on Furnace Road, just off Clove Valley Road.
