========,2,History.
Frank Colbert migrated from Mississippi to Indian Territory in 1846, and founded a large family there.
He was a great-grandson of "Minta Hoye", Chickasaw, and her husband James Logan Colbert, a fur trader.
As the Chickasaw had a matrilineal system, they considered children to be born into the mother's clan; those with multicultural ancestry were also accepted into the mother's clan.
Sons gained hereditary leadership positions through their mother's people.
Generations of mixed-race Colbert men became prominent leaders among the Chickasaw for most of the 19th century.
In 1853 Colbert established a ferry across the Red River, to help provide passage for travelers and settlers.
The Colbert's Ferry landing site is on the National Register of Historic Places.
