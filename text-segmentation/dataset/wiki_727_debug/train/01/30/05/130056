========,2,History.
The Durant area was once claimed by both Spain and France before officially becoming part of the United States after the Louisiana Purchase and Adams–Onís Treaty.
During the 1820s and 1830s the area was designated as part of the Choctaw Nation in the southern Indian Territory.
During the Indian removals the Choctaws followed the Choctaw Trail of Tears from their ancestral homeland in Mississippi and Alabama into this area.
The Choctaw Nation originally extended from the Mexican border in the west (now part of the Texas panhandle) to the Arkansas Territory in the east, from the Red River in the south to the South Canadian River in the north.
Pierre Durant and his four sons, all of French-Choctaw origin, made the journey up the Trail of Tears on the way to the southeastern part of the Choctaw Nation in 1832.
The brothers, grown, with families of their own, established homesteads from the Arkansas line to Durant.
One son, Fisher, married to a full-blood Choctaw, found a beautiful location for a home between Durant's present Eighth and Ninth avenues.
Fisher Durant's son Dixon Durant is recognized as the founder of Durant and is honored as its namesake.
