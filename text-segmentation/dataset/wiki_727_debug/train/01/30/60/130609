========,2,History.
Vian began as a trading post where the primary goods were meat-related, between Big Vian and Little Vian Creeks in the Cherokee Nation.
When a post office was established in 1886, the first postmaster, Mahala Thompson, wanted to name the town Round Mountain, but the name was already in use and was thus rejected.
The post office was therefore named Vian for the two creeks, which get their name from the French word for meat.
After the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway laid tracks through the town in 1888, it became an important shipping point for cotton produced in the surrounding farmland.
Vian was incorporated and shown on maps as a town in 1903.
