Carnegie was named after the famous Scottish American philanthropist, Andrew Carnegie.
The original name of the town was Latham.
The town was originally platted as North and South Latham.
North Latham was north of the Washita River, while South Latham lwas south of the river.
North Latham was really intended to be the commercial hub, but was never developed.
The Rock Island Railroad was supposed to go along the north side of the river.
The railroad was relocated along the south bank of the Washita.
So South Latham became the commercial hub.
North Latham withered and/or was never developed.
It was standard procedure to locate a railroad where the land owner paid the largest bribe to the owner of the railroad.
We have lost enough history to be unable to determine if this were the case.
It was not illegal.
