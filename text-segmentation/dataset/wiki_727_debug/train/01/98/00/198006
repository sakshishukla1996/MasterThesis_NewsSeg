========,1,preface.
San Pedro is a community within the city of Los Angeles, California.
Formerly a separate city, it consolidated with Los Angeles in 1909.
The Port of Los Angeles, a major international seaport, is partially located within San Pedro.
The district has grown from being dominated by the fishing industry to become primarily a working class community within the city of Los Angeles.
========,2,History.
The site, at the southern end of the Palos Verdes Peninsula, on the west side of San Pedro Bay, was used by Spanish ships starting in the 1540s.
The peninsula, including all of San Pedro, was the homeland of the Tongva-Gabrieleño Native American people for thousands of years.
In other areas of the Los Angeles Basin archeological sites date back 8,000–15,000 years.
The Tongva believe they have been here since the beginning of time.
Once called the "lords of the ocean", due to their mastery of oceangoing canoes (Ti'ats), many Tongva villages covered the coastline.
Their first contact with Europeans in 1542 with João Cabrilho (Juan Cabrillo), the Portuguese explorer who also was the first to write of them.
Chowigna and Suangna were two Tongva settlements of many in the peninsula area, which was also a departure point for their rancherias on the Channel Islands.
Legend has it that the Native Americans blessed the land of Palos Verdes, making it the most beautiful place on Earth.
The Tongva called the San Pedro area "Chaaw".
========,3,Origin of name.
San Pedro was named for St. Peter of Alexandria, a fourth-century bishop in Alexandria, Egypt.
His feast day is November 24 on the local ecclesiastical calendar of Spain, the day on which Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo discovered the bay in 1542 which would be known as San Pedro.
Santa Catalina Island, named after Catherine of Alexandria, was claimed for the Spanish Empire the next day, on her feast day, November 25.
In 1602–1603, Sebastián Vizcaíno (1548–1624) officially surveyed and mapped the California coastline, including San Pedro Bay, for New Spain.
The anglicized pronunciation, popularized by the English-speaking people of Midwestern America, is "san-PEE-dro".
========,3,Settlement.
European settlement began in 1769 as part of an effort to populate California, although trade restrictions encouraged more smuggling than regular business.
Rancho San Pedro is the site of the first Spanish land grant in Alta California, New Spain.
The land was granted in 1784 by King Carlos III to Juan Jose Dominguez, a retired Spanish soldier who came to California with the Gaspar de Portolà expedition.
When New Spain won its independence from the Spanish Empire and Alta California became part of Mexico, the trade restrictions were lifted, and the town flourished.
Under United States control after 1848, when the United States defeated Mexico in the Mexican-American war, the harbor was greatly improved and expanded under the guidance of Phineas Banning and John Gately Downey, the seventh governor of California after the Free Harbor Fight.
In 1868 Banning created the Los Angeles & San Pedro Railroad, Southern California's first railroad and used it to transport goods from San Pedro Bay to Los Angeles which soon became a major city in Southern California.
In 1906, the city of Los Angeles annexed the Harbor Gateway, a long, narrow strip of land connecting the city to the northern border of Wilmington, and in 1909, the larger city consolidated with Wilmington and with San Pedro.
========,3,United States Navy Battle Fleet home port 1919–1940.
In 1888, the War Department took control of a tract of land next to the bay and added to it in 1897 and 1910.
This became Fort MacArthur in 1914 and was a coastal defense site for many years.
Woodrow Wilson transferred 200 United States Navy ships from the Atlantic to the Pacific in 1919 when tension arose between the United States and Japan over the fate of China.
San Diego Bay was considered too shallow for the largest ships, so the battleships anchored in San Pedro Bay on August 9, 1919.
Local availability of fuel oil minimized transportation costs, and consistently good weather allowed frequent gunnery exercises off the nearby Channel Islands of California.
The heavy cruisers of the Scouting Force were transferred from the Atlantic to San Pedro in response to the 1931 Japanese invasion of Manchuria.
By 1934, 14 battleships, two aircraft carriers, 14 cruisers, and 16 support ships were based at San Pedro.
On April 1, 1940, the Pacific Fleet battleships sailed to Hawaii for annual fleet exercises.
The battleships remained in the Hawaiian Islands to deter Japanese aggression until the attack on Pearl Harbor.
The fleet post office, supply depot, fuel depot, degaussing range, ECM repair facility, and naval training schools for small craft, fire fighters, merchant ship communications, and anti-submarine attack remained at San Pedro through World War II; but the battle fleet never returned.
San Pedro was selected as the final home port of the battleship .
The "Iowa" now serves as a museum ship and memorial recognizing "the positive contributions of this battleship and its crew at critical moments in American history".

On July 19, 2003, the San Pedro Waterfront Red Car Line was opened, along the waterfront between downtown San Pedro and the Cruise Ship Terminal.
This line includes two newly constructed trolleys built to resemble the wood-bodied 500 class cars introduced in 1905 for the Pacific Electric Railway, which once operated more than of track running streetcars and interurbans in Southern California.
The line operates along former Pacific Electric right-of-way.
The line, rebuilt and maintained by the Port of Los Angeles, also has one original restored Pacific Electric interurban, which is used only for special charter excursions and special events.
The original car is in fact Pacific Electric 963 (former Los Angeles Pacific 713 as built in 1907) rebuilt by Richard Fellows and renumbered 1058.
Discussions have been held to extend the line to the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium.
Twenty-Eighth Street in San Pedro, between Gaffey Street and Peck Avenue, is the steepest section of public roadway in Los Angeles.
For about , the street climbs at a 33.3% angle, although the rest of the street is less steep.

ON May 15, 1923, social activist Upton Sinclair together with Hunter S. Kimbrough, his brother-in-law, Prince Hopkins and Hugh Hardyman were arrested for reading from the Bill of Rights of the US Constitution at Liberty Hill, which is believed to be the intersection of 4th and Beacon Streets.
This exercise of free speech took place during a strike of longshoreman.
The waterfront was tense when the strike was called.
The employers' fear of unions and eagerness to cut back on union gains made during the war was set against keen union interest not to lose benefits gained during the war.

Ethnically diverse San Pedro was a magnet for European immigrants from various countries for years, reflected in the number of restaurants representing diverse cuisines, especially Croatian, Portuguese, Mexican, Italian, Irish and Greek.
San Pedro is home to the largest Italian-American community in Southern California, centered on the "Via Italia" (South Cabrillo Avenue).
Estimates state that the community numbers about 45,000 Italian-Americans.
San Pedro is also considered the heart of the Croatian and Norwegian communities in Los Angeles.
The Croatian community, originally composed of seafarers and fishermen from the Dalmatia (especially the islands of Brač, Hvar, Vis and Korčula) region, has been present in San Pedro since the settlement began more than 200 years ago.
The City of Los Angeles even named a stretch of 9th Street "Croatian Place" in honor of the city's old Croatian community.
The Norwegian presence can be felt at the Norwegian Seamen's Church.
A large portion of San Pedro is also composed of Mexican-Americans, Hispanic immigrants and African-Americans with long-time roots in the community.
Much of their populations are based in the older, east side of the community surrounding the downtown area and bordering the Port of Los Angeles.
Until February 1942, San Pedro was home to a vibrant Japanese immigrant community of about 3,000 people who lived in what had been described as a "typical Japanese Fishing Village" on Terminal Island (East San Pedro).These Japanese immigrants pioneered albacore fishing out of San Pedro Bay and harvesting abalone off of White Point, thus leading the way in establishing a viable fishing industry in San Pedro.
The 48-hour forced expulsion of these San Pedro residents and the razing of their homes and shops, as part of the Japanese-American internment during World War II, is described in Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston's memoir "Farewell to Manzanar".
