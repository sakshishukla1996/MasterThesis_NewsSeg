========,2,Early history.
Early 1800s — French became greatly concerned and dismayed by the effects on the Church from the French Revolution and the attacks by unbelieving philosophers.
Some French including the Picquets began to consider the possibility of emigrating in order to establish elsewhere a new social order based on the principles of the Gospel.
1835 — Joseph Picquet (19 years old) was sent to American to "spy out the land" and report back to the family.
His father and elders could not afford to be away for such a long time.
Joseph was selected because they could depend on his loyalty, wisdom and good sense.
1835 – Joseph lands in New York.
Being unfamiliar with the language and customs of this new land, he worked for nine months in a business house in Philadelphia.
Early 1836 — Joseph begins explorations of the country.
His travels took him to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Lima, Ohio; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Indianapolis, Indiana; Vincennes, Indiana; Vandalia, Illinois; and Saint Louis, Missouri.
Instructed to stay away from large cities, he turned eastward and finally decided on the land (now Ste.
Marie) of rolling prairie and virgin timber partly because of its proximity to Vincennes, a strong French city and because of the availability of priests to say Mass.
At that time there was not a single house between Newton and Olney.
Oct. 1836 — Joseph returned to France and gave a favorable report of the land.
Jan. 29, 1837 — An association of five including Jacques Picquet, Joseph Picquet, Joseph Schifferstein, Charles Hoffman and Joseph Picquet was formed with the intent of the organization to be the acquisition and development of land in the United States so that they could build their own estates, free of oppression.
A contract was written and signed by the members of the association.
June 20, 1837 — Joseph returned to the United States with the nucleus of a colony, all related by either blood or marriage, twenty-five in all, on the ship, the Mogul.
Because they were all related, the new settlement was to be named Colonie des Freres or Colony of Brothers.
July 20, 1837 — The new immigrants bought a small farm near St. Francisville where they stayed for several months.
Oct. 1, 1837 — The settlers left St. Francisville and came to begin their new settlement.
They boarded with William Price who had a cabin nearby.
Oct. 12, 1837 — Ferdinand Hartrich, Etienne Lauer and Joseph Picquet went to Palestine and recorded approximately in the Land Office there.
Father Stephen Theodore Badin, a Frenchman came during this time to bless this work of their own hands and celebrate the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass in their presence.
Father Badin was the first priest ordained in the United States.
A stone monument fashioned to look like a log cabin stands on the grounds of the University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana, as a tribute to him.
There is also a mosaic on the east porch of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C. in memory of him.
Oct. 28, 1837 — The settlers gathered on a knoll, just south of the Embarras River and with proper pomp and circumstance took formal possession of the land, dedicating the village to the Virgin Mary, who has a privileged understanding of the human and the Divine, unlike any other person.
The newly acquired land was called "Colonie des Freres," or Colony of Brothers.
Eventually the name of the new settlement was changed to St. Marie with the French version of the spelling changing in 1892 by request of the French settlers.
Joseph Picquet made many more trips back to France to bring other family members to the new colony.
Marie quickly grew and erected its first church, free school, post office and store.
It was the "cultural center" amidst the miles and miles of wilderness.
