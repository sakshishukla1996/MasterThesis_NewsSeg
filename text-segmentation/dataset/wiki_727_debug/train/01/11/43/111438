========,2,Post Office.
Murals were produced in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department from 1934 to 1943.
They were intended to boost the morale of the American people suffering from the effects of the Depression by depicting uplifting subjects.
In 1942 artist Fay E. Davis  painted an oil on canvas mural titled "The Illini and Potawatomes Struggles at Starved Rock" in the town's post office.
The mural's muted earth tones faded badly over time and it was restored in 1988.
In 1993 a post office janitor complained about the nudity of the features of the Native Americans depicted in the mural.
The painting was covered by a venetian blind and only revealed upon request.
A successful petition drive to remove the blinds was begun soon after.
