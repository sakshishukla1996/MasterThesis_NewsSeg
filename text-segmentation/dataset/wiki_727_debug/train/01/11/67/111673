Arrowsmith was laid out on 7 December 1871 by Charles W. Holder ( 1808–1887) and Owen T. Reeves.
The founders kept their identities hidden for two years until the plat was officially recorded.
Both proprietors lived in Bloomington, were experienced land dealers, .and were involved in the creation of the Lafayette Bloomington and Mississippi Railroad.
Holder had been Jesse Fell’s partner in the founding of Towanda, Illinois, one of his partners in the development of Normal, Illinois, and the town of Holder, Illinois would soon be named in his honor.
Reeves was a Bloomington lawyer and judge who had been colonel of the short-lived 70th Illinois Infantry during the Civil War.
Arrowsmith Township had voted $30,000 in bonds to support the construction of the railroad on the condition that a station be established in their township.
It was at first thought that the name of the town would be Weldon, but it was soon learned that this name had been taken by a newly founded town in DeWitt County.
Arrowsmith takes its name from the township in which it was located, which had been named for early settler Ezekiel Arrowsmith.
Several of the first buildings in Arrowsmith were moved to the new own from Senex, located about three miles to the southwest near the edge of Old Town Timber.
Taking advantage of cold weather John Thompson had used thirty-two horses to skid his store from Senex to Arrowsmith in just over two hours.
