========,2,History.
Anchor was laid out 28 April 1880 by Daniel B. Stewart (5 December 1837 – 1920).
Stewart was a large landowner in the area.
He was born in New York and had come to Illinois in the early 1860s.
With others Stewart donated $10,000 to build ten miles of the railroad.
The town was created when the Clinton Bloomington and Northeastern Railroad was built.
Colfax, Cropsey and Cooksville were laid out at the same time.
This railroad was soon absorbed by the Illinois Central.
The first trains passed through the town on 4 July 1880.
The town takes its name from Anchor Township; early McLean County historians wrote that they did not know the source of the name Anchor.
The Original Town of Anchor was a rectangle extending on both sides of a diagonal track with no widening of the track as was commonly found at such towns.
A small triangular block north of the railroad was designated as Depot Park.
The Depot itself was on the north side of the tracks and the two elevators were on the south side.
Most of the early commercial buildings were on the north side of Second Street, which was north of the tracks.
By 1895 there was a brickyard on the southwest edge of the town and next to it was a coal shaft, but it is not clear if the shaft was ever finished.
There were also a handful of stores and the Morris Hotel Cropsey remained a small town.
