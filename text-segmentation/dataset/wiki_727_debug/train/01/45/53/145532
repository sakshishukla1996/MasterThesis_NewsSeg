Shinoda was born and raised in the Los Angeles suburb of Agoura Hills.

He has a younger brother, Jason.
He was raised as a liberal Protestant.
Shinoda's mother encouraged him to take classical piano lessons when he was six.
By 13, he expressed the desire to move toward playing jazz, blues, and even hip-hop.
He later added the guitar and rap-style vocals to his repertoire during his middle school and high school years.
Shinoda attended Agoura High School with Linkin Park bandmates Brad Delson and Rob Bourdon.
The three formed the band Xero, and began to make a more serious attempt to pursue a career in the music industry.
After graduating high school, Shinoda enrolled in the Art Center College of Design of Pasadena to study graphic design and illustration.
He attended classes with DJ and turntablist Joseph Hahn.
While studying at the Art Center College of Design, he experienced a form of identity crisis.
Years later, in an interview he said:
Shinoda graduated in 1998 with a Bachelor of Arts in Illustration and obtained a job as a graphic designer.
========,3,Linkin Park.
Shinoda founded Linkin Park with Rob Bourdon and Brad Delson in 1996.
They eventually brought in turntablist Joe Hahn, bassist Dave Farrell, and vocalist Mark Wakefield.
The earliest incarnation of the band was called Xero, and originally produced and recorded music in Shinoda's bedroom.
When the band was unable to find a record deal, Wakefield and Farrell left the band to pursue other musical interests.
The band later recruited Chester Bennington and successfully landed a record deal with Warner Bros Records.
Linkin Park's first studio album, "Hybrid Theory" went on to become a breakthrough success and helped the band attain international success.
Shinoda is closely involved in the technical aspects of the band's recordings, and over the subsequent releases that role continued to expand.
Shinoda, with guitarist Brad Delson, engineered and produced the band's "Hybrid Theory EP", and performed similar roles in the recording of "Hybrid Theory".
He has contributed to the instrumental and lyrical composition on most Linkin Park's songs.
Though Bennington primarily serves as Linkin Park's lead vocalist, he occasionally shares the role with Shinoda.
Bennington has a higher pitched and emotional style of singing, whereas Shinoda has a baritone hip-hop style delivery.
Shinoda organized and oversaw the band's first remix album "Reanimation" in 2002, contributing his own production of remixes that he made in his home studio for "Crawling" and "Pushing Me Away".
Shinoda collaborated with graffiti artist DELTA, graphic designer Frank Maddocks, and bandmate Joe Hahn to prepare "Reanimation"s artwork.

Shinoda also produced the album, with his bandmates and Don Gilmore which was his first production experience.

He produced and mixed the album, which won a Grammy Award for "best rap / song collaboration" in 2006.
The band released their next album, "Minutes to Midnight", on May 14, 2007.
On this album, Shinoda shared a production credit with longtime producer Rick Rubin.

Shinoda sang in the songs "In Between" and the B-side song, "No Roads Left", as well as rapping and singing in the songs "Bleed It Out" and "Hands Held High".
Despite the rarity of Shinoda-fronted singing tracks, music magazine "Hit Parader" ranked him at number 72 of the Top 100 Metal Vocalists of All Time.
Shinoda and Rubin again shared a production credit for Linkin Park's fourth album, "A Thousand Suns", which was released on September 14, 2010.
This album featured more of his singing than the rapping experience.
Shinoda raps in three tracks, specifically "When They Come for Me", "Wretches and Kings" and second single "Waiting for the End", while he sings on numerous songs (specifically verses), such as third single "Burning in the Skies", "Robot Boy", "Blackout", fourth single "Iridescent" and first single "The Catalyst".
Bennington and Shinoda sing simultaneously together on "The Catalyst", "Jornada del Muerto" and "Robot Boy", while "Iridescent" features all band members singing together.

Whereas there were tracks like "Skin to Bone", "Roads Untraveled" and "Castle of Glass" which featured the singing vocals by Shinoda and had folk music, influenced by the works of Bob Dylan, as well as the inspirations of Dylan.
Allmusic described Shinoda's work for the album as, "a fitting soundtrack for aging rap-rockers who are comfortable in their skin but restless at heart".
"Recharged", which is a remix album consisting remixes of original songs from "Living Things", was released on October 29, 2013.
Shinoda used his EDM experience he got from Avicii while working on the track "Wake Me Up", and also from Steve Aoki while working on "A Light That Never Comes", to remix some songs for the album.
Shinoda reinterpreted songs like "Castle of Glass" and "Victimized".
He also worked with his old friends like DJ Vice and Ryu for the album.

The first single of the album, "Guilty All the Same", is the first non-remix song by the band to feature rap by a guest artist instead of Shinoda.
In 2017, Shinoda again worked with Delson on the production of "One More Light".
The album is the first to feature other songwriters rather than the band itself.

Shinoda commented on the inspiration behind the "Glorious Excess" series, stating, "It Got to a point where the pervasiveness of 'celebrity news' concerned me.
It seemed like it has jumped out of its niche into places where it doesn't belong.
I would be watching the news, and thinking, 'of all the things going on in the world right now, why are they covering so-and-so's breakup?'
It didn't make sense to me.
Add to that the fact that I'm supposed to somehow 'belong' to that celebrity group—and I really don't feel like I do in a lot of ways—and you can see how the topic started to become really interesting to me.
The Glorious Excess (BORN) show was my way of diving into those topics, trying to find answers.
It follows a central 'celebrity' character, who is filthy rich, slightly violent, and famous without any particular skill or talent."
On November 6, 2014, Shinoda and Hahn painted an artwork on the Berlin Wall.
