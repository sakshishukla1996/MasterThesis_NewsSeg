The 20th-century American oil painter Emile Gruppe painted Waterville on several canvases from a variety of visual points of view, almost always including the church, the Lamoille River, and the Church St. covered bridge.
Gruppe maintained a seasonal studio and painting school in the nearby village of Jeffersonville, Vermont.
