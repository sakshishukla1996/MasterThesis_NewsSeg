In 1780 during the Revolution, the village was attacked in the Royalton Raid, when a combined force of British soldiers and Indians burned houses and killed livestock.
Although the surface of the town is very broken, the intervales contain fertile soil, and farming became an important industry.

The White River and its tributaries provided water power for mills.
By 1859, when the population reached 1,240, Sharon had 12 sawmills, a gristmill, and a bobbin factory.
