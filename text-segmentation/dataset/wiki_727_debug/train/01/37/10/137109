========,1,preface.
Lal Bahadur Shastri (, , 2 October 1904 – 11 January 1966) was the 2nd Prime Minister of the Republic of India and a leader of the Indian National Congress party.
Shastri joined the Indian independence movement in the 1920s.
Deeply impressed and influenced by Mahatma Gandhi (with whom he shared his birthday), he became a loyal follower, first of Gandhi, and then of Jawaharlal Nehru.
Following independence in 1947, he joined the latter's government and became one of Prime Minister Nehru's principal , first as Railways Minister (1951–56), and then in a variety of other functions, including Home Minister.
He led the country during the Indo-Pakistan War of 1965.
His slogan of "Jai Jawan Jai Kisan" ("Hail the soldier, Hail the farmer") became very popular during the war and is remembered even today.
The war formally ended with the Tashkent Agreement of 10 January 1966; he died the following day, still in Tashkent, the cause of death was said to be a heart attack but there are various reasons to think that it was a planned murder by the CIA.
========,2,Early years (1904–1917).
Shastri was born at the house of his maternal grandparents in Mughalsarai, Varanasi in a Kayastha Hindu family, that had traditionally been employed as Highly administrators and civil servants.
Shastri's paternal ancestors had been in the service of the "zamindar" of Ramnagar near Varanasi and Shastri lived there for the first one year of his life.
Shastri's father, Sharada Prasad Shastri, was a school teacher who later became a clerk in the revenue office at Allahabad, while his mother, Ramdulari Devi, was the daughter of Munshi Hazari Lal, the headmaster and English teacher at a railway school in Mughalsarai.
Shastri was the second child and eldest son of his parents; he had an elder sister, Kailashi Devi (b.
In April 1906, When Shastri was hardly one year old, his father, had only recently been promoted to the post of deputy tahsildar, died in an epidemic of bubonic plague.
Ramdulari Devi, then only 23 and pregnant with her third child, took her two children and moved from Ramnnagar to her father's house in Mughalsarai and settled there for good.
She gave birth to a daughter, Sundari Devi, in July 1906.
Thus, Shastri and his sisters grew up in the household of his maternal grandfather, Hazari Lal.
However, Hazari Lal himself died from a stroke in mid-1908, after which the family were looked after by his brother (Shastri's great-uncle) Darbari Lal, who was the head clerk in the opium regulation department at Ghazipur, and later by his son (Ramdulari Devi's cousin) Bindeshwari Prasad, a school teacher in Mughalsarai.
Thus, the greatness of the traditional Indian joint family system, and the traditions of family responsibility and kinship, are deeply evident in Shastri's case, where the orphan child of a penniless widow was raised by his distant relatives in a manner which enabled him to become Prime Minister of India.
In Shastri's family, as with many Kayastha families, it was the custom in that era for children to receive an education in the Urdu language and culture.
This is because Urdu/Persian had been the language of government for centuries, before being replaced by English, and old traditions persisted into the 20th century.
Therefore, Shastri began his education at the age of four under the tutelage of a "maulvi" (a Muslim cleric), Budhan Mian, at the East Central Railway Inter college in Mughalsarai.
He studied there until the sixth standard.
In 1917, Bindeshwari Prasad (who was now head of the household) was transferred to Varanasi, and the entire family moved there, including Ramdulari Devi and her three children.
In Varanasi, Shastri joining the seventh standard at Harish Chandra High School.
At this time, he decided to drop his caste-derived surname of "Verma" (which is a traditional optional surname for all Kayastha families).
========,2,The young "satyagrahi" (1921–1945).
While Shastri's family had no links to the independence movement then taking shape, among his teachers at Harish Chandra High School was an intensely patriotic and highly respected teacher named Nishkameshwar Prasad Mishra, who gave Shastri much-needed financial support by allowing him to tutor his children.
Inspired by Mishra's patriotism, Shastri took a deep interest in the freedom struggle, and began to study its history and the works of several of its noted personalities, including those of Swami Vivekananda, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Gandhi and Annie Besant.
In January 1921, when Shastri was in the 10 standard and three months from sitting the final examinations, he attended a public meeting in Benares hosted by Gandhi and Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya.
Inspired by the Mahatma's call for students to withdraw from government schools and join the non-cooperation movement, Shastri withdrew from Harish Chadra the next day and joined the local branch of the Congress Party as a volunteer, actively participating in picketing and anti-government demonstrations.
He was soon arrested and jailed, but was then let off as he was still a minor.
Shastri's immediate supervisor was a former Benares Hindu University lecturer named J.B. Kripalani, who would become one of the most prominent leaders of the Indian independence movement and among Gandhi's closest followers.
Recognising the need for the younger volunteers to continue their educations, Kripalani and a friend, V.N.
Sharma, had founded an informal school centered around "nationalist education" to educate the young activists in their nation's heritage.
With the support of a wealthy philanthropist and ardent Congress nationalist, Shiv Prasad Gupta, the Kashi Vidyapith was inaugurated by Gandhi in Benares as a national institution of higher education on 10 February 1921.
Among the first students of the new institution, Shastri graduated with a first-class degree in philosophy and ethics from the Vidyapith in 1925.
He was given the title "Shastri" ("scholar").
The title was a bachelor's degree awarded by the Vidyapith, but it stuck as part of his name.
Shastri enrolled himself as a life member of the Servants of the People Society (Lok Sevak Mandal), founded by Lala Lajpat Rai, and began to work for the betterment of the Harijans under Gandhi's direction at Muzaffarpur.
Later he became the President of the Society.
========,3,Independence activism.
In 1928 shastri become an active member of congress at the call of gandhiji.
Shastri participated in the Salt Satyagraha in 1930.
He was imprisoned for two and a half years.
Later, he worked as the Organizing Secretary of the Parliamentary Board of U.P.
in 1937.
In 1940, he was sent to prison for one year, for offering individual Satyagraha support to the independence movement.
On 8 August 1942, Mahatma Gandhi issued the Quit India speech at Gowalia Tank in Mumbai, demanding that the British leave India.
Shastri, who had just then come out after a year in prison, travelled to Allahabad.
For a week, he sent instructions to the independence activists from Jawaharlal Nehru's home, Anand Bhavan.
A few days later, he was arrested and imprisoned until 1946.
Shastri spent almost nine years in jail in total.
During his stay in prison, he spent time reading books and became familiar with the works of western philosophers, revolutionaries and social reformers.
========,2,Political career (1947–64).
========,3,State minister.
Following India's independence, Shastri was appointed Parliamentary Secretary in his home state, Uttar Pradesh.
He became the Minister of Police and Transport under Govind Ballabh Pant's Chief Ministership on 15 August 1947 following Rafi Ahmed Kidwai's departure to become minister at centre.
As the Transport Minister, he was the first to appoint women conductors.
As the minister in charge of the Police Department, he ordered that police use jets of water instead of lathis to disperse unruly crowds.
His tenure as police minister (As Home Minister was called prior to 1950) saw successful curbing of communal riots in 1947, mass migration and resettlement of refugees.
========,3,Cabinet minister.
In 1951, Shastri was made the General Secretary of the All-India Congress Committee with Jawaharlal Nehru as the Prime Minister.
He was directly responsible for the selection of candidates and the direction of publicity and electioneering activities.
His cabinet consisted of the finest business men of India including Ratilal Premchand Mehta.
He played an important role in the landslide successes of the Congress Party in the Indian General Elections of 1952, 1957 and 1962.
In 1952, he successfully contested UP Vidhansabha from Soraon North cum Phulpur West seat and won getting over 69% of vote.
He was believed to be retained as home minister of UP, but in a surprise move was called to Centre as minister by Nehru.
Shastri was made Minister of Railways in First Cabinet of Republic of India on 13 May 1952.
========,2,Prime minister of India (1964–66).
Jawaharlal Nehru died in office on 27 May 1964 and left a void.
Then Congress Party President K. Kamaraj was instrumental in making Shastri Prime Minister on 9 June.
Shastri, though mild-mannered and soft-spoken, was a Nehruvian socialist and thus held appeal to those wishing to prevent the ascent of conservative right-winger Morarji Desai.
In his first broadcast as Prime Minister, on 11 June 1964, Shastri stated:
========,3,Domestic policies.
Shastri retained many members of Nehru's Council of Ministers.
T. T. Krishnamachari was retained as the Finance Minister of India, as was Defence Minister Yashwantrao Chavan.
He appointed Swaran Singh to succeed him as External Affairs Minister.
He also appointed Indira Gandhi, daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru and former Congress President, as the Minister of Information and Broadcasting.
Gulzarilal Nanda continued as the Minister of Home Affairs.
Shastri's tenure witnessed the Madras anti-Hindi agitation of 1965.
The government of India had for a long time made an effort to establish Hindi as the sole national language of India.
This was resisted by the non-Hindi speaking states particularly Madras State.
To calm the situation, Shastri gave assurances that English would continue to be used as the official language as long the non-Hindi speaking states wanted.
The riots subsided after Shastri's assurance, as did the student agitation.
========,3,Economic policies.
Shastri discontinued Nehru's socialist economic policies with central planning.
He promoted the White Revolution – a national campaign to increase the production and supply of milk – by supporting the Amul milk co-operative of Anand, Gujarat and creating the National Dairy Development Board.
He visited Anand on 31 October 1964 for inauguration of the Cattle Feed Factory of Amul at Kanjari.
As he was keenly interested in knowing the success of this co-operative, he stayed overnight with farmers in a village, and even had dinner with a farmer's family.
He discussed his wish with Mr Verghese Kurien, then the General Manager of Kaira District Co-operative Milk Producers’ Union Ltd (Amul) to replicate this model to other parts of the country for improving the socio-economic conditions of farmers.
As a result of this visit, the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) was established at Anand in 1965
While speaking on the chronic food shortages across the country, Shastri urged people to voluntarily give up one meal so that the food saved could be distributed to the affected populace.
However he ensured that he first implemented the system in his own family before appealing to the country.
He went on air to appeal to his countrymen to skip a meal a week.
The response to his appeal was overwhelming.
Even restaurants and eateries downed the shutters on Monday evenings.
Many parts of the country observed the "Shastri Vrat".
He motivated the country to maximize the cultivation of food grains by ploughing the lawn himself, at his official residence in New Delhi.
During the 22-day war with Pakistan in 1965, On 19 October 1965, Shastri gave the seminal ‘Jai Jawan Jai Kishan’ ("Hail the soldier, Hail the farmer")slogan at Urwa in Allahabad that became a national slogan.
Underlining the need to boost India's food production.
Shastri also promoted the Green Revolution.
Though he was a socialist, Shastri stated that India cannot have a regimented type of economy.
The Food Corporation of India was set up under the Food Corporation's Act 1964.
Also The National Agricultural Products Board Act.
========,3,Foreign policies.
Shastri continued Nehru policy of non-alignment but also built closer relations with the Soviet Union.
In the aftermath of the Sino-Indian War of 1962 and the formation of military ties between the Chinese People's Republic and Pakistan, Shastri's government decided to expand the defence budget of India's armed forces.
In 1964, Shastri signed an accord with the Sri Lankan Prime minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike regarding the status of Indian Tamils in the then Ceylon.
This agreement is also known as the Sirima-Shastri Pact or the Bandaranaike-Shastri pact.
Under the terms of this agreement, 600,000 Indian Tamils were to be repatriated, while 375,000 were to be granted Sri Lankan citizenship.
This settlement was to be done by 31 October 1981.
However, after Shastri's death, by 1981, India had taken only 300,000 Tamils as repatriates, while Sri Lanka had granted citizenship to only 185,000 citizens (plus another 62,000 born after 1964).
Later, India declined to consider any further applications for citizenship, stating that the 1964 agreement had lapsed.
India's relationship with Burma had been strained after the 1962 Military coup followed by the repatriation of many Indian families in 1964 by Burma.
While the central government in New Delhi monitored the overall process of repatriation and arranged for identification and transportation of the Indian returnees from Burma, it fell under the responsibilities of local governments to provide adequate facilities to shelter the repatriates upon disembarkation on Indian soil.
Particularly in the Madras State the Chief Minister during that time, Minjur K. Bhaktavatsalam, showed care in rehabilitation of the returnees.
In December 1965 Shastri made an official visit with his Family to Rangoon, Burma and re-established cordial relations with the country's military government of General Ne Win.
========,3,War with Pakistan.
Shastri's greatest moment came when he led India in the 1965 Indo-Pak War.
Laying claim to half the Kutch peninsula, the Pakistani army skirmished with Indian forces in August, 1965.
In his report to the Lok Sabha on the confrontation in Kutch, Shastri stated:
In September 1965, major incursions of militants and Pakistani soldiers began, hoping not only to break down the government but incite a sympathetic revolt.
The revolt did not happen, and India sent its forces across the Ceasefire Line (now Line of Control) and threatened Pakistan by crossing the International Border near Lahore as war broke out on a general scale.
Massive tank battles occurred in the Punjab, and while the Pakistani forces made gains in the northern part of subcontinent, Indian forces captured the key post at Haji Pir, in Kashmir, and brought the Pakistani city of Lahore under artillery and mortar fire.
On 17 September 1965, while the Indo-Pak war was on, India received a letter from China alleging that the Indian army had set up army equipment in Chinese territory, and India would face China's wrath, unless the equipment was pulled down.
In spite of the threat of aggression from China, Shastri declared "China's allegation is untrue".The Chinese did not respond, but the Indo-Pak war resulted in some 3–4,000 casualties on each side and significant loss of material.
The Indo-Pak war ended on 23 September 1965 with a United Nations-mandated ceasefire.
In a broadcast to the nation on the day of the ceasefire, Shastri stated:
During his tenure as Prime Minister, Shastri visited many countries including Russia, Yugoslavia, England, Canada, Nepal, Egypt and Burma.
Incidentally while returning from the Non Alliance Conference in Cairo on the invitation of then President of the Pakistan, Mohammed Ayub Khan to have lunch with him, Shastri made a stop over at Karachi Airport for few hours and breaking from the protocol Ayub Khan personally received him at the Airport and had an informal meeting during October 1964.
After the declaration of ceasefire with Pakistan in 1965, Shastri and Ayub Khan attended a summit in Tashkent (former USSR, now in modern Uzbekistan), organized by Alexei Kosygin.
On 10 January 1966, Shastri and Ayub Khan signed the Tashkent Declaration.
========,3,Death.
Shastri died in Tashkent, at 02:00 on the day after signing the Tashkent Declaration, reportedly due to a heart attack, but people allege conspiracy behind the death.
He was the first Prime Minister of India to die overseas.
He was eulogised as a national hero and the Vijay Ghat memorial established in his memory.
Upon his death, Gulzarilal Nanda once again assumed the role of Acting Prime Minister until the Congress Parliamentary Party elected Indira Gandhi over Morarji Desai to officially succeed Shastri.
========,2,Mystery behind Lal Bahadur Shastri's death.
Shastri's sudden death immediately after signing the Tashkent Pact with Pakistan raised many questions in the minds of Indian citizens.
The Prime Minister of India going to Tashkent for a pact and never coming back has not been accepted easily by Indian citizens.
His health was fit according to his doctor, R. N. Chugh, and he had no sign of heart trouble before.
Shastri's sudden death has led to persistent conspiracy theories that he was poisoned.
The first inquiry into his death, conducted by the Raj Narain Inquiry, as it came to be known, however did not come up with any conclusions, and today no record of this inquiry exists with the Indian Parliament's library.
It was alleged that no post-mortem was done on Shastri, but the Indian government in 2009, claimed it did have a report of a medical investigation conducted by Shastri's doctor and some Russian doctors.
Furthermore, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) revealed that there was no record of any destruction or loss of documents in the PMO having a bearing on Shastri's death.
The Russian butler attending on Shastri at the time of his death was arrested for suspected poisoning but released later as per the news source.
It was maintained that Shastri had died of cardiac arrest but his family insisted he was poisoned.
After Shastri's death, his wife Lalita Shastri had alleged he was poisoned.
An epic poetry book in Hindi titled "Lalita Ke Aansoo" written by Krant M. L. Verma was published in 1978.
In this book, the tragic story about the death of Shastri has been narrated by his wife Lalita Shastri.
There are still serious doubts surrounding the nature of his death.
His son, Sunil Shastri, asked the government to unravel the mystery behind Lal Bahadur Shastri's death.
Raising doubts about the dark blue spots and cut marks on the abdomen of his father's body after his death in 1966, Sunil asked how the cut marks appeared if a post-mortem had not been conducted.
When Shastri went to the USSR for the Tashkent talks, he wanted a promise from Ayub Khan that Pakistan would never use force in the future.
But the talks did not proceed and followed Shastri's death on the next day.
The Indian Government released no information about his death, and the media then was kept silent.
The possible existence of a conspiracy was covered in India by the "Outlook" magazine.
A query was later posed by Anuj Dhar, author of "CIA's Eye on South Asia", under the Right to Information Act to declassify a document supposedly related to Shastri's death, but the Prime Minister's Office refused to oblige, reportedly citing that this could lead to harming of foreign relations, cause disruption in the country and cause breach of parliamentary privileges.
Another RTI plea by Kuldip Nayar was also declined, as PMO cited exemption from disclosure on the plea.
The home ministry is yet to respond to queries whether India conducted a post-mortem on Shastri, and if the government had investigated allegations of foul play.
The Delhi Police in their reply to an RTI application said they do not have any record pertaining to Shastri's death.
The Ministry of External Affairs has already said no post-mortem was conducted in the USSR.
The Central Public Information Officer of Delhi Police in his reply dated 29 July said, "No such record related to the death of the former Prime Minister of India Lal Bahadur Shastri is available in this district...
Hence the requisite information pertaining to New Delhi district may please be treated as nil."
This has created more doubts.
The PMO answered only two questions of the RTI application, saying it has only one classified document pertaining to the death of Shastri, which is exempted from disclosure under the RTI Act.
It sent the rest of the questions to the Ministry of External Affairs and Home Ministry to answer.
The MEA said the only document from the erstwhile Soviet Government is "the report of the Joint Medical Investigation conducted by a team comprising R. N. Chugh, Doctor in-Attendance to the PM and some Russian doctors" and added no post-mortem was conducted in the USSR.
The Home Ministry referred the matter to Delhi Police and National Archives for the response pertaining to any post-mortem conducted on the body of Shastri in India.
Sunil Shastri, son of the former Prime Minister, called the transferring of application as "absurd" and "silly joke".
"He (Lal Bahadur Shastri) died as sitting Prime Minister.
It sounds very silly that MHA is referring the matter of death of second Prime Minister of India to a district level police."
He also demanded that "It should be looked into by highest authorities like President, Prime Minister and home minister."
Later, Gregory Douglas, a journalist who interviewed former CIA operative Robert Crowley over a period of 4 years, recorded their telephone conversations and published a transcription in a book titled "Conversations with the Crow".
In the book, Crowley claimed that the CIA was responsible for eliminating Homi Bhabha, an Indian nuclear scientist whose plane crashed into Alps, when he was going to attend a conference in Vienna; and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
Crowley said that the USA was wary of India's rigid stand on nuclear policy and of then prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, who wanted to go ahead with nuclear tests.
He also said that the agency was worried about collective domination by India and Russia over the region, for which a strong deterrent was required.
========,2,Family and descendants.
On 16 May 1928, Shastri married Lalita Devi a lady from Mirzapur.
The marriage, which was arranged by their parents in the traditional Indian way, was harmonious and conventional.
The couple were blessed with four sons and two daughters, namely
***LIST***.
========,2,Legacy.
Ramachandra Guha argued that Shastri shared little in common with his predecessor Jawaharlal Nehru.
While Shastri preferred peace with Pakistan, writing to a friend after the Indo-Pakistani War in 1965 that the problems between both countries should be settled amicably, he had previously displayed a knack for taking quick and decisive actions during the war.
He swiftly took the advice of his commanders, and ordered a strike across the Punjab border.
This was in stark contrast to Nehru who in a similar situation in 1962, had refused to call in the air force to relieve the pressure on the ground troops.
At the end of the conflict, Shastri flamboyantly posed for a photograph on top of a captured US-supplied Pakistani M48 Patton tank.
However, in common with Nehru, Shastri was a secularist who refused to mix religion with politics.
In a public meeting held at the Ram Lila grounds in Delhi, a few days after the ceasefire, he complained against a BBC report which claimed that Shastri's identity as a Hindu meant that he was ready for a war with Pakistan.
He stated:
Kuldip Nayar, Shastri's media advisor from 1960 to 1964, recalls that, during the Quit India Movement, his daughter was ill and he was released on parole from jail.
However, he could not save her life because doctors had prescribed costly drugs.
Later on in 1963, on the day when he was dropped from the cabinet, he was sitting in his home in the dark, without a light.
When asked about the reason, he said as he no longer is a minister, all expenses will have to be paid by himself and that as a MP and minister he didn't earn enough to save for time of need.
Although Shastri had been a cabinet minister for many years in the 1950s, he was poor when he died.
All he owned at the end was an old car, which he had bought in instalments from the government and for which he still owed money.
He was a member of Servants of India society (which included Gandhi, Lala Lajpat Rai, Gopal Krishna Gokhle) which asked all its members to shun accumulation of private property and remain in public life as servants of people.
He was the first railway minister who resigned from office following a major train accident as he felt moral responsibility.
