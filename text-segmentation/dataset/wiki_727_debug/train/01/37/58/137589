========,1,preface.
Reston is a census-designated place (CDP) in Fairfax County, Virginia, United States, within the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.
The population was 58,404 at the 2010 census.
An internationally known planned community founded in 1964, it was built with the goal of revolutionizing post–World War II concepts of land use and residential/corporate development in suburban America.
The Reston Town Center is home to many businesses, with high-rise and low-rise commercial buildings that are home to shops, restaurants, offices, a cinema, and a hotel.
It comprises over of office space.
Municipal, government-like services are provided by the nonprofit Reston Association, which is supported by a per-household fee for all residential properties in Reston.
In 2012, Reston was ranked 7th in the Best Place to Live in America by CNNMoney Magazine.
========,2,History.
========,3,Conception.
Reston was conceived as a planned community by Robert E. Simon.
Founded on April 10, 1964 (Simon's 50th birthday) and named for his initials, it was one of the first modern, post-war planned communities in America, which sparked a revival of the planned community concept.
Simon's family had recently sold Carnegie Hall, and Simon used the funds to create Reston.
Simon hired Conklin Rossant Architects as master planners to incorporate higher density housing to conserve open space, as well as mixed use areas for industry, business, recreation, education, and housing.
The first section of the community to be built, Lake Anne Plaza, was designed by James Rossant (who studied under Walter Gropius at the Harvard Graduate School of Design) to emulate the Italian coastal town of Portofino.
Lake Anne village was designed with modern architectural themes that extend to a nearby elementary school, a gasoline station, and two churches.
Lake Anne also has an art gallery, several restaurants, the Reston Historic Trust Museum, shops, and a senior citizens' fellowship house.
All are local businesses, as there are no chain stores or chain restaurants allowed in Lake Anne.
Close by are the cubist townhouses at Hickory Cluster that were designed by the noted modernist architect, Charles M. Goodman, in the International Style.
Other sections of the town, such as Hunters Woods, South Lakes, and North Point, were developed later, each with a neighborhood shopping center and supermarket.
========,3,Other background.
The land on which Reston sits was initially owned by Lord Fairfax during the 18th century.
C.A.
Wiehle (for whom Wiehle Avenue is named) bought the land later in the 1880s.
He died after construction of several buildings.
His sons did not share his vision, and sold the land to A. Smith Bowman, who built a bourbon distillery on the site while maintaining a farm on most of the area, a tract.
An office retail development and a road are named for him.
In 1961, Robert E. Simon bought most of the land, except for on which the Bowman distillery continued to operate until 1987.
========,3,Development.
The growth and development of Reston has been monitored by newspaper articles, national magazines, and scholarly journals on architecture and land use.
In 1967 the First Lady of the United States, Mrs. Lyndon Johnson, visited Reston to take a walking tour along its pathways as part of her interest in beautification projects.
Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin visited Reston elementary schools named for them.
"The Washington Post" featured a road trip to Reston in January 2006, and a relatively new website "Beyond DC" has a page devoted to Reston with almost 150 photos.
Reston experienced increasing traffic congestion as it grew in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
This was a time when Reston's population was growing but the Dulles Toll Road had not been built.
Commuter traffic between Reston and Washington created serious traffic congestion on the roads that connected Reston to Washington DC.
In 1984 the toll road opened, and in 1986 the West Falls Church Washington Metro station opened.
Most recently the Fairfax County Parkway, a major north-south artery, was opened.
Reston has grown to a point where it now fits the definition of an edge city.
While Reston takes on the statistical properties of an edge city, its tightly controlled design averted several problems they typically face, such as hostile pedestrian situations and lack of mass transit.
Many of the neighborhoods in Reston were designed to be medium density, which is atypical of an edge city.
In other ways it is a textbook example, with a majority of medium-rise office buildings, and some citizens opposed to the expansion of its high-density core.
========,3,Ebola virus scare.
A filovirus, at first suspected to be Ebola virus (EBOV), was discovered among crab-eating macaques ("Macaca fascicularis") within the Covance Primate Quarantine Unit in 1989.
This attracted significant media attention, including the publication of "The Hot Zone".
The filovirus was found to be distinct from EBOV and to be nonpathogenic for humans.
It was named after the community, and is now known as Reston virus (RESTV).
Macaques found to be or suspected to be infected with RESTV were euthanized, and the facility was sterilized.
The facility was located in an office park near Sunset Hills Road and Wiehle Avenue.
It was eventually torn down, and a daycare was built in its place.
========,2,Zoning.
The careful planning and zoning within Reston allows for common grounds, several parks, large swaths of wooded areas with picturesque runs (streams), wildflower meadows, two golf courses, nearly 20 public swimming pools, bridle paths, a bike path, four lakes, tennis courts, and extensive foot pathways.
These pathways, combined with bridges and tunnels, help to separate pedestrians from vehicular traffic and increase safety at certain street crossings.
Reston was built in wooded areas of oak, maple, sycamore, and Virginia pine.
Reston is the location for a regional government center serving citizens in the northern part of Fairfax County.
The Reston Regional Library, Reston Hospital Center, and the Embry Rucker Community Shelter are located nearby.
The Reston police sub-station is also the office headquarters of the locally elected supervisor of the Hunter Mill District within the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors.
Reston is one of just a handful of communities in the U.S. that has been designated a Backyard Wildlife Habitat community.
Usually this designation is for single-family homes.
Reston serves as the headquarters for the North American command of the German armed forces and oversees upwards up 1,500 troops deployed in the United States at any given time.
========,3,Guiding principles.
Part of the New Town movement, from the beginning Reston was designed to follow "guiding principles" in its development that would stress quality of life.
Citizens would be able to live in the same community while going through different life cycles with different housing needs as they aged.
It was hoped that Restonians could live, work, and have recreation in their own community, with common grounds and scenic beauty shared equally regardless of income level.
Beyond the influence of the New Town movement, Reston was part of a back-to-the-land movement popular in the 1960s and early 1970s.
The principles incorporated in the community can be seen as a reaction to the new suburban communities of the post-war era (e.g., Levittown).
Among the problems in these communities that Reston responded to included income segregation, a lack of natural preservation, suburbs that served only as bedroom communities for commuters, a lack of public space in new developments, and a lack of community ties in new developments.
Many early residents settled in Reston because of the ideals of the community.
Reston was planned with the following principles, as stated by Robert E. Simon in 1962:
Greenbelt, Maryland, a 1930s community built as part of a federal New Deal housing experiment, is another example of a New Town.
Subsequent New Town movement communities include Roosevelt Island in New York City and Columbia, Maryland.
However, Reston was the first post-war community in the U.S. to use clustered townhouse development, a strategy that allows for the preservation of open space along with higher density.
Reston was also the first 20th-century private community in the U.S. to incorporate natural preservation in its planning (Greenbelt was a publicly supported community).
An important part of Reston's development is its five village centers and one town center.
Each village center, all of which (save North Point) predate the Reston Town Center, was designed to be a half-mile walk from most homes and incorporate the daily retail and community service needs of residents.
Denser developments, such as apartments and clustered town homes are clustered around each village center.
The first village center built was the critically acclaimed Lake Anne (see below), followed by (in chronological order) Hunters Woods, Tall Oaks, South Lakes, and North Point.
Reston was planned before the term "new urbanism" entered into mainstream use, but it follows new urbanism guidelines in a number of ways.
Reston was built with an extensive path system, and recently Fairfax County has constructed many sidewalks.
It is possible to bike to downtown Reston in 15 minutes from most locations.
The downtown and original areas also incorporate mixed-use development.
Further mixed-use development is planned for areas where Washington Metro stations are or will be located.
However, Reston differs from New Urbanism principles in several important ways.
Almost all buildings are oriented away from main streets, and few major arteries have complete sidewalk networks, although pedestrian and bike travel is easily accomplished on the isolated nature paths referred to above.
This is a result of Fairfax County controlling Reston's transportation planning—until recently, the Fairfax County zoning code only required sidewalks to be built by developers in certain cases.
The inward orientation of buildings was a preference of the early developers of Reston, who wished to avoid the commercial strip look that dominates many suburban developments in favor of a more naturalistic look.
In addition, the Dulles Toll Road Corridor of office parks cuts a half-mile wide swath across the community, with only five north-south connections, making cross-town travel by car and foot difficult.
The creation of a sixth connection at Soapstone Drive has been talked about in the past by planners, and the creation of mixed-use developments around planned Metro Stations may help better knit the community together.
========,2,Culture and activities.
A special tax district within Fairfax County was created to fund the various educational, cultural, and recreational activities of the Reston Community Center.
Its main building is located on the southern side of Reston at Hunters Woods Plaza.
The center has a theater, indoor heated swimming pool with jacuzzi, ballroom, meeting rooms, and classroom space.
A smaller branch of the Reston Community Center is located at Lake Anne Plaza.
========,3,Theater and music.
The local theater group, the award-winning Reston Community Players, present four stage productions annually in the high-tech theater at the Reston Community Center in the Hunters Woods Plaza.
The Reston Chorale and Reston Community Orchestra also have regular performances here and throughout the town.
In the summer free concerts are offered at Lake Anne Plaza on Thursday evenings (where years ago a young Nikki Hornsby from Burke, Virginia, was paid to sing while playing her guitar) and at the Reston Town Center on Saturday evenings.
Various festivals take place at these locations also.
Canoes, rowboats, kayaks, and paddle boats can be rented on Lake Anne during the summer.
Residents can also enjoy low-cost theatrical and choir performances presented by the local high school.
The theatre department at South Lakes High School has received numerous awards over the years, including the honor of representing the Mid-Atlantic region in the 2000 Edinburgh Festival Fringe in Scotland.
Four miles (6 km) from Reston there are year-round concerts at Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts, where the National Symphony Orchestra has its summer home away from the Kennedy Center.
This venue offers world-class performances ranging from opera and ballet to symphonic and popular music.
Visitors can purchase reserved seats inside the pavilion or picnic on sloping lawns while enjoying a concert.
During the cooler months bluegrass music can be heard indoors at The Barns of Wolf Trap.
========,3,Parks and recreation.
Restonians can avail themselves of the many cultural activities in Washington, D.C., by driving into the city or taking buses to connect to a Metro train.
Two upscale shopping centers are located nearby in Tysons Corner, as well as the shops located throughout Reston and nearby Herndon.
Two miles (3 km) from Reston on Leesburg Pike (Route 7) is the Colvin Run Mill, operated by the Fairfax County Park Authority.
It is a working 1811 gristmill that won a first-place restoration award from the American Institute of Architects in 1973.
The miller's house, barn, and historic post office/gift shop provide visitors with a glimpse of nineteenth century rural Virginia life.
Daily public tours are offered.
A few miles to the west along the same road there is the historic 1820 Dranesville Tavern, also operated by the park authority and rented out for weddings, parties, and corporate functions.
Also in Reston is the Lake Fairfax Park, operated by the county.
It features boat rentals from a new marina, a large outdoor pool complex called "The Water Mine", overnight campground facilities, picnic areas, and fireworks on Independence Day.

========,2,Governance.
As noted above, Reston is unincorporated; it receives services from the county and from the Reston Association, which operates recreational facilities across and maintains pathways and common grounds.
It has been proposed to incorporate Reston as a municipality.
A referendum to incorporate Reston failed in 1980 by a 2–1 margin, however.
The covenants at Reston specify that the assessments paid to the association are to be in proportion to the assessed value of the property as determined by Fairfax County.
"The Voluntary City" notes that this may have been an attempt to imitate local governments.
However, it argues that it would have been better to assess all property owners the same amount for three reasons.
First, the public goods that residents enjoy are not likely to be dependent on the value of the property they occupy.
Second, the tax structure is factored into the price of the property; thus, an inexpensive home saddled with higher assessments would become even more inexpensive, because its value would be diminished by the tying of these payments to the property.
Third, payments based on assessed value dampen the incentive to improve the value of the property.
Reston has a federal system of government in which cluster associations form around neighborhoods.
These cluster associations are responsible for maintaining common areas and have the power to tax their residents to do so.
Many of these clusters have their own websites.
The majority of Reston lies within Virginia's 11th congressional district and is represented in Congress by Democratic Representative Gerry Connolly.
