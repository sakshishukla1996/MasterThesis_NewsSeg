========,2,History.
The town was created on August 12, 1761 by way of a royal charter which King George III of England issued to Governor Benning Wentworth of New Hampshire.
Wentworth named it for Augustus Henry Fitzroy, 3rd Duke of Grafton, 4th Earl of Arlington and 4th Viscount Thetford, who in 1768 became prime minister.
It was first settled in 1764 by John Chamberlin, who lived at East Thetford beside the Connecticut River.
He was an agent for one of 62 proprietors (51 from Hebron, Connecticut).
In 1910, the Camp Fire Girls were founded locally.
This became a national organization within two years.
Gove Hill Retreat, a nonprofit Christian Retreat center, was founded in 1966 in Thetford Center.
The center supplied hospitality to religious, educational and other non-profit organizations.
The retreat was sited on property originally owned by John Gove, the first farmer and name sake of Gove Hill.
It was closed December 31, 2013 after the American Baptist Churches of Vermont and New Hampshire (ABCVNH) decided the yearly upkeep was not worth it.
The retreat center had run a deficit for a number of years.
The Pastor's larger salary were both believed to be factors in the closing of the doors.
