========,2,History.
Kamas derives its name from "Camassia quamash", a source of food for Native Americans.
Kamas was inhabited intermittently by several tribes of Indians, including members of the Ute, Shoshone, and Snake tribes.
The first permanent settlements in the valley are believed to have been built by Mormon pioneers including Abraham Marchant, John Lambert, and John Pack who settled under the direction of Brigham Young.
One prominent figure in Kamas folklore history is Thomas Rhoads.
According to legend, Indian guides from an area Ute Tribe revealed to Rhoads the location of a gold mine from which he was allowed to take gold to assist in the construction of the Salt Lake Temple.
The only condition the Indian guides gave for revealing the location of this mine was that Rhoads agreed not to reveal the location of the mine to any other person.
Rhoads adhered to the terms of this agreement until his eventual death from an illness.
The "Rhoads Mine" is now considered lost, but its legend survives in several books which have been published on the topic.
