========,2,Description.
As of the 2010 census, the city population was 7,551.
It lies in the Mormon Corridor, just off Interstate 70 about east of its junction with Interstate 15.
The county can be best described as "rural diversified" due to the convergence of agricultural, retail and industrial activities.
Richfield has developed as a regional tourist center because it is located on the interstate freeway about halfway between Los Angeles, California and Denver, Colorado, attracting many automobile travelers who stop at the city.
Richfield is remote from larger cities, about or more in any direction from more populous towns, while dozens of smaller communities are found in the general area.
Its remoteness, plus its location on major transportation corridors, makes it central Utah's "de facto" regional capital, a shopping and "commercial capital of a vast mountain-valley region."
Many people from the region drive to Richfield to shop, bowl, golf, to attend theater, concerts, or for religious gatherings.
They are also drawn to the community college, affiliated with Snow College, and go there to receive medical care.
Richfield is part of "Panoramaland;" it is on the thoroughfare to several nearby national parks and national forests.
========,2,History.
Prehistoric people occupied the Richfield area for more than 7,000 years.
Fremont culture remains are found near most community sites in the Sevier area and are dated from approximately CE 1 to CE 1000.
In the late summer of 1776, Father Escalante and his party of Spanish explorers passed through the general vicinity, looking for a trail to link Nuevo Mexico and California.
During the late 1820s, Jedediah Smith and other fur traders crossed the area.
Sevier County lies on one of the variants on the Old Spanish Trail between Santa Fe, New Mexico and California and was used by travelers between 1830 and 1850.
In the early part of January 1864, a party of ten men under the leadership of Albert Lewis came from Sanpete County, Utah and arrived in what is now Richfield.
The Mormon settlers found fertile soil, good water and wood in the nearby hills.
They decided that it was a desirable site for a settlement.
These pioneers made a dwelling place for all ten men, which they called 'The Hole in the Ground.'
They carefully covered this hole with brush willows and other materials and made a crude chimney of rocks.
This dugout was located on today's Main Street.
These men spent the remainder of the winter in this dwelling, planning and preparing for the time when they could bring their families.
The early Mormon settlements were abandoned in 1867 due to the conflict known as the Black Hawk War.
But, when resettled in 1871, Richfield grew to become a regional center.
The coming of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad in 1891 opened the valley for expanded agricultural commerce and mining.
In 1939, Utah Governor Henry H. Blood vetoed a proposal for a junior college in Richfield.
Fifty-seven years later, Snow College opened a Richfield campus, which serves about 600 students per year.
========,2,Religion.
As in most settled areas of rural Utah, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) plays a prominent role.
The Mormons were highly industrious colonizers.
From 1847, when they founded Salt Lake City, until 1877, they founded 360 towns.
Following direction from Brigham Young, Latter-day Saints founded the town and outlying hamlets about 150 years ago.
Members of the LDS Church are predominant among the residents.
Even in this heart of Mormon country, non-Mormons and non-participating Mormons, the latter euphemistically called "less-actives," fill a percentage of elected offices.
Due largely to combined influences of conservative rural culture and the Latter-day Saints, the voters of the city and the surrounding county are predominately Republican.
The Richfield area has 20 major denominational churches: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, St. Elizabeth Catholic Church, First Baptist Church, Sister of Holy Cross, Jehovah's Witnesses, Good Shepherd Lutheran Church, Assembly of God and others.
