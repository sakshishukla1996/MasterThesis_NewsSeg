========,1,preface.
Coaldale is a borough in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, United States.
Settled in 1827, it was incorporated in 1906 from part of the former Rahn Township; it is named for the coal industry—wherein, it was one of the principal early industry centers.
Coaldale is in the southern Anthracite Coal region in the Panther Creek valley, a tributary of the Little Schuylkill River, along which U.S. Route 209 was eventually built between the steep climb up Pisgah Mountain from Nesquehoning (easterly) and its outlet in Tamaqua, Pennsylvania about five miles to the west.
The town is virtually joined at the hip to nearby Lansford, to its immediate east—as both were founded as company towns on lands owned by and mined by the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company (LC&N) while technically "on opposite sides of the county lines".
In truth, the history, business situation, and fortunes of not just the two, but of three towns, the third being the nearby Summit Hill, PA located a few thousand feet upslope were tied in decades of co-development because the LC&N had built the western terminus of the nation's second railroad, the Summit Hill and Mauch Chunk Gravity Railway to ship coal out, and opened multiple mines throughout Coaldale and Lansford and the rest of the Panther Creek Valley in the days when railroads were coming into their own.
The town has a bus stop which has a billboard on one side reading "Everybody's Goal Is Mine More Coal".
It was founded by John Moser.
The area on the western border of the borough is known as Seek.
========,2,History.
Coaldale was historically a coal-mining town wherein the whole region was effectively the property of the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company.
This, the railroads the LC&N put in and a small shirt factory were the main historic industries in Coaldale.
Because of the adverse topology, the LC&N took several decades to survey and drive a railbed with a negotiable grade from Mauch Chunk through Nesquehoning, along the Nesquehoning ridge to Hometown, and then up the Panther Creek Valley from Tamaqua.
Former pro football player Johnny Gildea was born in Coaldale.
