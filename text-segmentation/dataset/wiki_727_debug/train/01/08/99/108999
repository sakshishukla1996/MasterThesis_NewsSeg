As of the 2010 United States Census, the population was 34,743.
It is part of the Palm Bay – Melbourne – Titusville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.
The name "Merritt Island" also refers to the extent of the former island, which is now a peninsula.
Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge and NASA's John F. Kennedy Space Center are located on the northern part of Merritt Island.
The southern area is heavily residential, with centralized light commercial and light industrial areas.
The island does not belong to any official city.
The central part of Merritt Island, previously known as Merritt City, is home to the majority of the population and includes the local high school, library, and shopping district.
========,2,History.
========,3,Etymology.
Merritt Island owes its name to the king of Spain.
The entire island was part of a land grant given by the king to a nobleman named Merritt.
========,3,Post-Columbian.
In 1605, Spanish explorer Alvaro Mexia visited while on a diplomatic mission to the local tribes living in the Indian River area.
He called the local tribe the Ulumay.
Merritt Island is the prominent island on a color map he drew of the area, a copy of which is in the archives at the Library of Congress and the archives in Seville, Spain.
In April 1788, French botanist André Michaux traveled in Merritt Island, near Cape Canaveral.
He spent five days looking for plants.
He wrote a letter on April 24, 1788 from St Augustine.
He reported discovering the flag or bigflower paw-paw, "Asimina obovata" ("Annona grandiflora" (Bartr.)).
In 1837, Fort Ann was constructed on the east coast of Merritt Island, to protect the area against the Seminoles.
Merritt Island's recent history dates back to the mid-19th century and centers on the growth of citrus, stressing the cultivation of pineapples and oranges.
The Indian River oranges and grapefruit come from this sandy area.
The island's population grew in the 1950s and 1960s as the Space Race began and nearby NASA expanded.
Construction of a barge canal to the Intracoastal Waterway from the Atlantic Ocean (for power plant oil shipments) cut off the northern half of the island for many years.
To this day, the northern portion of the island remains slightly less developed, with a few areas remaining as cattle pasture or citrus land.
The small towns on the island vanished with the coming of the Space Age, and now only live on in the names of streets and historic churches.
In 1988, citizens defeated a proposed incorporation into a city, 77% opposed to 23% in favor.
Sea Ray operated a factory on Merritt Island from 1978 to 2012.
At one time it employed 1200 people.
It closed the plant in 2013.
========,2,Geography.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 62.88%, is water.
Merritt Island is a peninsula.
The construction of the Crawlerway in the north (for NASA space vehicles to move to the launch pad over Banana Creek) connected Merritt Island to a mainland peninsula.
Merritt Island is still considered a natural island.
To the west and south it is separated by the Indian River Lagoon and the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway.
The east side of Merritt Island splits and is divided by Sykes Creek and Newfound Harbor.
They, in turn, are separated by the Banana River Lagoon from Cocoa Beach, Florida.
To the west, the island is connected by causeways to mainland Brevard County near Titusville and Cocoa on its northern end, and in Melbourne on its southern end.
========,3,Fauna.
To the north, Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge, along with a narrow barrier island that make up Canaveral National Seashore, offer an unpopulated protected buffer area for rocket launches at Kennedy Space Center.
Migratory birds join the more resident wildlife, including alligators, manatees, dolphins, sea turtles, bald eagles, ospreys, bobcats, and the elusive Florida panther.
A number of bald eagle nests are monitored atop power line poles along SR 3 within Kennedy Space Center.
There are about 12,000 feral pigs in North Merritt Island.
Licensed trappers catch about 2,000 annually, which keeps the population even.
The United States Fish and Wildlife Service would like to reduce the population.
