========,2,History.
========,3,Early human occupation.
Evidence for the presence of Paleo-Indians in the Melbourne area during the late Pleistocene epoch was uncovered during the 1920s.
C. P. Singleton, a Harvard University zoologist, discovered the bones of a mammoth ("Mammuthus columbi") on his property along Crane Creek, from Melbourne, and brought in Amherst College paleontologist Frederick B. Loomis to excavate the skeleton.
Loomis found a second elephant, with a "large rough flint instrument" among fragments of the elephant's ribs.
Loomis found in the same stratum mammoth, mastodon, horse, ground sloth, tapir, peccary, camel, and saber-tooth cat bones, all extinct in Florida since the end of the Pleistocene 10,000 years ago.
At a nearby site a human rib and charcoal were found in association with "Mylodon", "Megalonyx", and "Chlamytherium" (ground sloth) teeth.
A finely worked spear point found with these items may have been displaced from a later stratum.
In 1925 attention shifted to the Melbourne golf course.
A crushed human skull with finger, arm, and leg bones was found in association with a horse tooth.
A piece of ivory that appeared to have been modified by humans was found at the bottom of the stratum containing bones.
Other finds included a spear point near a mastodon bone and a turtle-back scraper and blade found with bear, camel, mastodon, horse, and tapir bones.
Similar human remains, Pleistocene animals and Paleo-Indian artifacts were found in Vero Beach, south of Melbourne, and similar Paleo-Indian artifacts were found at Lake Helen Blazes, southwest of Melbourne.
========,3,Settlement.

The first settlers arrived after 1877.
They included Richard W. Goode, his father John Goode, Cornthwaite John Hector, Captain Peter Wright, Balaam Allen, Wright Brothers, and Thomas Mason.
The city, formerly called "Crane Creek", was named Melbourne in honor of its first postmaster, Cornthwaite John Hector, an Englishman who had spent much of his life in Melbourne, Australia.
He is buried in the Melbourne Cemetery, along with many early residents in the area.
The first school in Melbourne was built in 1883 and is on permanent exhibit on the campus of Florida Institute of Technology.
By 1885, the town had 70 people.
The Greater Allen Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church was founded in 1885 and is still active.
In the late 1890s, the Brownlie-Maxwell Funeral Home opened and it is still in business.

It opened in 1934.

This was used by the Melbourne Civic Improvement Board to build the Melbourne Auditorium, the first library and fire station, and various parks.
The board was dissolved when Melbourne was merged with Eau Gallie in 1969.
Streetlights were gradually added until, by the early 1960s, streets east of Babcock Street had lights.
Lights were added to streets west of Babcock after the early 1960s.
