========,1,preface.
San Luis Obispo (; Spanish for "St. Louis, the Bishop [of Toulouse]"), or SLO for short, is a city in the U.S. state of California, located roughly midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco on the Central Coast.
The population was 45,119 at the 2010 census.
The population of San Luis Obispo County was 269,637 in 2010.
Founded in 1772 by Spanish Franciscan Junípero Serra, San Luis Obispo is one of California's oldest communities.
Serra's original mission was named for the 13th Century saint and bishop Louis of Toulouse.
The city, locally referred to as "San Luis," "SLO," or "SLO Town" (as its county is also referred to as "SLO") is the county seat of San Luis Obispo County and is adjacent to California Polytechnic State University.
========,2,History.
========,3,Native American.
The earliest human inhabitants of the local area were the Chumash people.
One of the earliest villages lies south of San Luis Obispo and reflects the landscape of the early Holocene when estuaries came farther inland.
The Chumash people used marine resources of the inlets and bays along the Central Coast and inhabited a network of villages, including sites at Los Osos and Morro Creek.
========,3,Mission period.
During the Spanish Empire expansion throughout the world, specifically in 1769, Franciscan Junípero Serra received orders from Spain to bring the Catholic faith to the natives of Alta California; the idea was to unify the empire under the same religion and language.
Mission San Diego was the first Spanish mission founded in Alta California that same year.
On September 7–8, 1769, an expedition led by Gaspar de Portolá entered the San Luis Obispo area from coastal areas around today's Pismo Beach.
One of the expedition's three diarists, padre Juan Crespí, recorded the name given to this area by the soldiers as "Cañada de Los Osos" ("cañada" translates as "valley" or "canyon").
The party traveled north along San Luis Obispo Creek, turned west through Los Osos valley, and reached Morro Bay on September 9.
In 1770, Portola established the Presidio of Monterey and Junípero Serra founded the second mission, San Carlos Borromeo, in Monterey.
The mission was moved to Carmel the following year.
As supplies dwindled in 1772 at the mission and presidio, the people faced starvation.
Remembering the Valley of the Bears, Presidio of Monterey commander Pedro Fages (a member of the Portolà expedition) led a hunting expedition to bring back food.
Over twenty-five mule loads of dried bear meat and seed were sent north to relieve the missionaries, soldiers, and neophytes (baptized natives).
The natives were impressed at the ease by which the Spaniards could take down the huge grizzlies with their weapons.
Some of the bear meat was traded with the local people in exchange for edible seed.
It was after this that Junípero Serra decided that La Cañada de Los Osos would be an ideal place for the fifth mission.
The area had abundant supplies of food and water, the climate was also very mild, and the local Chumash were very friendly.
With soldiers, muleteers, and pack animals carrying mission supplies, Junípero Serra set out from Carmel to reach the Valley of the Bears.
On September 1, 1772, Junípero Serra celebrated the first Mass with a cross erected near San Luis Creek.
The very next day, he departed for San Diego leaving Fr.
José Cavaller, with the difficult task of building the mission.
José Cavaller, five soldiers and two neophytes began building Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa, which would later become the town of San Luis Obispo.
The first mission structures were built with whatever materials could be found nearby.
Later, more permanent buildings were constructed with adobe walls, wood timber roof beams and tile roofs.
The completed mission compound included: the church, the priests' residence, the convento, storerooms, neophyte and visitor residences, soldiers' barracks and other structures.
The mission also had a grist mill, tannery, water supply system, land for farming and pastures for livestock.
The whole community of priests, natives and soldiers needed to produce goods for their own livelihood.
When the Mexican War of Independence from Spain broke out in 1810, all California missions had to become virtually self-sufficient, receiving few funds or supplies from Spanish sources.
Beginning soon after Mexico won her independence from Spain in 1821, anti-Spanish feelings led to calls for expulsion of the Spanish Franciscans and secularization of the missions.
Because the fledgling Mexican government had many more important problems to deal with than far-off California, actual secularization didn't happen until the mid-1830s.
========,3,Rancho and town.
After 1834, the mission became an ordinary parish, and most of its huge land holdings were broken up into land grants called "ranchos".
The ranchos were given by Mexican land grant from 1837–1846, with the mission itself being granted in the final year.
The central community, however, remained in the same location and formed the nucleus of today's city of San Luis Obispo.
After the Mexican–American War annexed California to the United States, San Luis Obispo was the first town incorporated in the newly formed San Luis Obispo County.
It remained the center of the county to the present.
Early in the American period, the region was well known for lawlessness.
It gained a reputation as "Barrio del Tigre" (or Tiger-Town) because of the endemic problem.
Robberies and murders brought about several lynchings, culminating in a vigilance committee that killed a total of 7 men suspected of such misdeeds (the most lethal in California history).
Members of the committee remained influential members of the community for decades.
The ranchos remained focused on cattle after the conquest of California.
With the discovery of gold, the county experienced a major economic surge with the rising price of beef, with the highest prices coming in 1851.
The county remained focused on cattle until 1863, when a drought left most ranchos devastated.
Residents quickly turned to other venues, leading to the breaking up of many of the ranchos and a major change in the economic climate of the town, which focused less on cattle ranching and more on dairies, agriculture, and mined goods from then onward.
San Luis Obispo once had a burgeoning Chinatown in the vicinity of Palm St. and Chorro Street.
Laborers were brought from China by Ah Louis in order to construct the Pacific Coast Railway, roads connecting San Luis Obispo to Paso Robles and Paso Robles to Cambria, and also the 1884 to 1894 tunneling through Cuesta Ridge for the Southern Pacific Railroad.
The town's Chinatown revolved around Ah Louis Store and other Palm Street businesses owned and run by Chinese business people.
Today, Mee Heng Low chop suey shop is all that remains of the culture, although a slightly Chinatown-themed commercial development has been planned.
A display of some of the unearthed relics from this period can be seen on the first floor of the Palm Street parking garage, which was built over the location where Chinatown once stood.
The San Luis Obispo Historical Society (adjacent to the Mission) also contains rotating historical exhibits.
San Luis Obispo was also a popular stop on both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 with the rise of car culture.
Due to its popularity as a stop, it was the location of the first motel, the Milestone Mo-Tel.
Among San Luis Obispo's historical buildings is the former San Luis Obispo Carnegie Library, located at 696 Monterey Street.
The San Luis Obispo Carnegie Library was built in 1905 with a grant of $10,000 from Andrew Carnegie, who funded the establishment of 142 California libraries in the early 1900s.
The Romanesque style building was designed by architect W. H. Weeks of Watsonville, California and was built by contractor Joseph Maino of San Luis Obispo.
As one of numerous California public buildings designed by W. H. Weeks, it shares features with Carnegie libraries in nearby Lompoc and Paso Robles.
The San Luis Obispo Carnegie building served as the city library until 1955, when a new public library was built at the corner of Palm and Morro Streets.
It has been home to the San Luis Obispo County Historical Museum since 1956.
The Carnegie Library building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
San Luis Obispo's largest and oldest voluntary organization is the San Luis Obispo Chamber of Commerce, which also is the oldest and largest voluntary organization in San Luis Obispo County.

Cal Poly's open house, Poly Royal, was held annually from 1933 to 1990.
It was canceled in 1945 due to war rationing.
It began as a show-and-tell for students to display their projects.
It traces its origins to the 1904 Farmer's Institute and Picnic Basket.
By the 1980s, as the college became "the most popular...university in the 19-campus CSU system", Poly Royal began drawing over 100,000 people from throughout the state, including 126,000 people in 1985.
Concerts, parties, and other entertainment were added and it earned $3–4 million in revenue for the city every year.
Following a "mini-riot" in 1989 at an off-campus apartment during Poly Royal, the events in 1990 would cancel the event "indefinitely."
Two nights of rioting on April 28–29 led to 127 arrests, over 100 injuries and 14 police injuries on top of "several hundred thousand dollars'" worth of damage.
A liquor store near campus, Campus Bottle, was destroyed by revelers demanding alcohol.

Since June 2000, the first Thursday of every month is The Bike Happening (also known as Bike Nite) in San Luis Obispo.
People gather after the farmers' market at the Mission Plaza with their bikes.
The bikers then go around on multiple circuits on the main streets of downtown adhering to the traffic laws (for the most part).
The ride is considered a fun/social ride meant to encourage people to get back on their bikes and to have fun.
Each Bike Happening has a theme and a large portion of the crowd is in some costume adherent to the theme.
One of the cultural focal centers of San Luis Obispo is the Christopher Cohan Performing Arts Center built on the Cal Poly campus, which was constructed utilizing the donations of local businesses and individuals.

The largest venue, Harmon Hall, seats 1,300.
Many high school and college programs are scheduled.
Local artists perform plays, music and dance.
The addition of the Performing Arts Center attracts many touring performances which are usually not found in communities of comparable size to San Luis Obispo.
The summer of 2007 was the opening concert of the Forbes Pipe Organ, which was built elevated into a side wall of Harmon Hall and required the donation of a further $3 million for purchase and installation.
