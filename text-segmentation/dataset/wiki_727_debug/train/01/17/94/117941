========,2,Education.
The Village of Deerfield is home to the Deerfield Public School District, often shortened to Deerfield schools.
Deerfield's mascot is the "Minutemen."
The school covers the area of Deerfield and also attracts many students from surrounding cities, villages and townships for various personal, academic and athletic reasons.
The school is located at 252 Deerfield Highway.
There is one building in Deerfield, which provides for the students in K-12.
As of the 2009-2010 school year, all Deerfield athletics are part of a cooperative sports program where Deerfield Schools and Britton Schools combine to make athletic teams.
When these two schools combine teams they are known as Britton/Deerfield or BD and adopted the mascot "Patriots" in 2008 thanks to the push for a mascot by parents of students in the program.
The BD Patriots participate in the Tri-County Conference; which includes teams from Clinton, Madison, Morenci, Sand Creek, Summerfield, Whiteford, and Whitmore Lake schools.
For the 2010-2011 school year, both the Britton-Macon and Deerfield school boards voted to adopt a "shared services" plan for their middle school and high school students.
All middle school students (6-8) from both districts will attend classes in Deerfield while high schoolers (9-12) will attend classes in Britton.
Both school buildings will maintain their current elementary classes.
Along with the resolution, the school boards also moved to consolidate the districts.
Official ballot language was finalized and placed on the ballot in both districts on August 3, 2010.
The support was overwhelming and consolidation passed 652-174.
The school districts officially became one district on July 1, 2011.
