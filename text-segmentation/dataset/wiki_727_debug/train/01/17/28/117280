The name of the city shares the name of the county and probably has its origin from the Cheboygan River, although the precise meaning is no longer known.
It may have come from an Ojibwe word "zhaabonigan" meaning "sewing needle".
Alternatively, the origin may have been "Chabwegan," meaning "a place of ore." The city is at the mouth of the Cheboygan River on Lake Huron.

========,2,History.
Cheboygan was originally an Ojibwe settlement.
In 1844, Jacob Sammons, a cooper from Fort Mackinac, chose the old native camping ground (then called "Shabwegan") as the site for his cabin.
He recruited other settlers, and a post office named "Duncan" was established in 1846.
It was made the county seat in 1853.
Duncan or Duncan City was given a post office in 1850 as a result of the building of sawmills in this area.
Duncan was made the county seat in 1853 and the location of the federal land office in 1855.
The county seat shifted to Cheboygan in about 1870.
Later Duncan was included within the expanded boundaries of Cheboygan.
The area became known as Cheboygan in 1870.
It was incorporated as a village in 1871.
Rail maps in 1876 show planned rail service for Cheboygan, but due to various setbacks, rail did not arrive there until 1881.
There was a theater built in town in 1877.
Cheboygan was incorporated as a city (versus a village) in 1889.
In approximately 1890, Cheboygan became the home port for ferryboats to nearby Bois Blanc, an island in the Straits of Mackinac.
The "Kristen D" is a ferry which operates between Cheboygan and Bois Blanc Island.
Early in the 20th century, it was home to the pioneering brass era cyclecar maker, Flagler.
