========,2,History.
Devil's Lake was a Potawatami village until about 1830.
Manitou Beach, first noted by Euro-American settlers in the early 1830s, quickly became a favored resort in southeast Michigan by the turn of the 20th century.
It quickly outgrew the comparably sized community of Devils Lake at the north end of the lake.
Steam launches ferried tourists from the depot to the hotels and attractions, which included bath houses, a dance pavilion, pleasure craft rental facilities, a water slide, picnic areas and eating establishments.
The name 'Manitou Beach' is derived from the Potawatomi name of Devils Lake, "Michemanetue", meaning, "Lake of the (evil) Spirit".
The Manitou Beach post office was established on March 20, 1889, with Columbus F. Becker as the first postmaster.
The office was discontinued on December 31, 1892, and reestablished on January 17, 1893.
Manitou Beach was also as station on the Cincinnati, Jackson and Mackinaw Railroad (later part of the Cincinnati Northern Railway).
Devil's Lake was said to have been named by the Potawatomi leader Meteau (or Mitteau) after his daughter, who was an able swimmer, drowned in the lake and her body was never recovered.
Meteau believed her to have been taken by evil spirits.
The first white settlers here arrived in 1833.
The Devils Lake post office was established on October 19, 1885, with John B. Allen as the first postmaster.
The office was discontinued on October 31, 1936.
The Detroit, Toledo and Milwaukee Railroad had a stop at Devil's Lake.
The Manitou Beach region was devastated by two F4 tornadoes during the April 11, 1965 Palm Sunday Tornado Outbreak.
Most of what was destroyed was rebuilt, including the dance hall and two churches.
Over the course of the past four decades, the resort has had few reminders of the tornado.
Several books on the lake resort have been written, including "Along the Trails of Michemanetue" (2009) and "Night of the Wind" (2002) By Dan Cherry, "Lake Reflections" by Margaret Brighton and the Lakes Preservation League (1996), and "Ho!
For Devils Lake" by Barbara Page Roys (1998).
In 2010, the community of Manitou Beach continues to draw vacationers, and because of its popularity, one by one the small seasonal cottages are being replaced by large, year-round homes.
The Devils Lake Drive-In-Church, a drive-in movie theater, closed its doors after 58 seasons due to the death of its operator.
The Manitou Beach Inn, a long-time staple of the business community, was destroyed by fire January 3, 2010.
The inn was rebuilt and was the start of a revitalization of the old business district along Walnut Street
