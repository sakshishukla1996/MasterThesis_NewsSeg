========,2,History.
The area which became the CDP was the site of a tourist area in the early 20th Century.
An 1894 Chicago newspaper article was the catalyst in making the shore a resort area, and a rail line extension from nearby Coloma in 1896 started the building boom.
Pavilions, hotels, and cottages soon followed, with nationally known acts performing at the pavilions.
Most of these buildings are no longer extant.

The nearby Deer Forest animal park in Coloma Township opened at the end of the heyday of the resort area.
Though many of its assets were auctioned off on September 26, 2009, the park continued to operate through the 2014 season.
It closed permanently at the end of that season and animals were dispersed to various other locations.
The property itself was auctioned off on June 29, 2015.
