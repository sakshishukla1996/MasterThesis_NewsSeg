Joab Enos, a brother of Dr. Enos, moved into the township in 1838.
He and William Boughton laid out a village known first as "Pipestone", and later as "Shanghai".
Although only a few lots were sold, a post office was established in the village in 1846, and later there was a store operated by John Garrow.
The word "pipestone" refers to a red stone, known today as catlinite, which is used to make the bowls of some Indian ceremonial pipes.
