========,1,preface.
James Bond Jr. is a fictional character described as the nephew of Ian Fleming's masterspy, James Bond.
The name was first used in 1967 for a spinoff novel entitled "The Adventures of James Bond Junior 003½" authored by the never clarified pseudonym R. D. Mascott.
The idea of Bond having a nephew was used again in 1991 in an American animated series for television, in which the title character defeats threats to ensure the safety of the free world.
The series was mildly successful, spawning a six-volume novelization series by John Peel (writing as John Vincent), a 12-issue comic book series by Marvel Comics published in 1992, and video games for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super NES.
While revolving around the nephew of James Bond, no surviving relatives are mentioned in Fleming's novels, although he unknowingly conceives a child with the former Japanese film actress Kissy Suzuki in "You Only Live Twice".

The animated series, produced by Murakami-Wolf-Swenson and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Animation, debuted on 30 September 1991, with a total of 65 half-hour episodes produced.

While attending prep school at Warfield Academy, James Bond Jr., with the help of his friends IQ (the grandson of Q), and Gordo Leiter (the son of Felix Leiter), fight against the evil terrorist organisation SCUM (Saboteurs and Criminals United in Mayhem), a SPECTRE-like organization.
Expanding on his uncle's famous line, James Bond Jr's catchphrase was "Bond, James Bond.
Like many animated series, it regularly surpasses the Bond movies in terms of fantastic gadgets, while the violence of the adult Bond series is nowhere in evidence.
The show was fully sanctioned by (and produced in association with) Danjaq and United Artists, who held the rights to the James Bond property.
Jaws, a recurring villain from the films "The Spy Who Loved Me" and "Moonraker", made regular appearances, usually partnered with Nick Nack, a villain from "The Man with the Golden Gun", forming a bickering comical duo.
