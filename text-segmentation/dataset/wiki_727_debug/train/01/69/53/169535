========,3,Early years.
Hootie & the Blowfish formed in 1986.
The quartet met when they were freshmen at the University of South Carolina in Columbia.
Bryan heard Rucker singing in the showers of the dorm they shared and was impressed by his vocal ability.
They began playing cover tunes as The Wolf Brothers; eventually they collaborated with Felber, a former high school bandmate of Bryan's, and Jim "Soni" Sonefeld as Hootie & the Blowfish.
The name is a conjunction of the nicknames of two of their college friends.
Brantley Smith was the original drummer for the band.
He left the group to pursue music ministry, but he has made scattered guest appearances with the band (he played cello on their "MTV Unplugged" performance in 1996, and played drums at Gruene Hall in Gruene, Texas, on June 27, 2008).
The band independently released two cassette demo EPs in 1991 and 1992.
In 1993, they pressed 50,000 copies of a self-released EP, "Kootchypop".
They were signed to Atlantic Records in August 1993, after being discovered by Atlantic A&R representative Tim Sommer, a former music journalist and member of the art rock band Hugo Largo.
Sommer recalled that other record labels were uninterested in signing Hootie & The Blowfish because their sound was radically different from the grunge music that was popular at the time.
========,3,1994–95: "Cracked Rear View" and mainstream success.
Their mainstream debut album was "Cracked Rear View" (1994).
It was an instant success, went platinum 16 times in the U.S., became the best-selling album of 1995, and was one of the fastest-selling debut albums of all time.
The album featured four hits, "Hold My Hand" (U.S. No.
10), "Let Her Cry" (U.S. No.
9), "Only Wanna Be with You" (U.S. No.
6), and "Time" (U.S. No.

13), and sold four million copies in the U.S. Hootie & the Blowfish has since released three more studio albums: "Musical Chairs", "Hootie & the Blowfish", and "Looking for Lucky".
They also released a B-sides and rarities compilation in 2000 entitled "Scattered, Smothered and Covered".

In 1995, Hootie & the Blowfish contributed the song "Hey Hey What Can I Do" to the "Encomium" tribute album to Led Zeppelin.
Their cover of Canadian group 54-40's "I Go Blind", released on the soundtrack to the TV series "Friends" in 1995, did not appear on "Cracked Rear View" or "Fairweather Johnson", but became a hit on radio in 1996 after three singles from "Fairweather Johnson" had been released.
Both "Hey Hey What Can I Do" and "I Go Blind" were later released on the collection "Scattered, Smothered and Covered".

Rucker also said that the split will last "for five or six years, or until I record three or four country albums".
He later amended his statement, saying, "To be honest with you, we're not even split up right now, and we're not really thinking about splitting up."
Rucker has recorded a solo album, "Learn to Live", for Capitol Records.
