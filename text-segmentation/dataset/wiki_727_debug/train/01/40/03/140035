========,2,History.
The six mile square that would become Milladore was first surveyed in the summer of 1851 by a crew working for the U.S. government.
In October and November 1852 another crew marked its section corners, walking through the woods and wading the swamps, measuring with chain and compass.
When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
"This Township is composed of Hardwood Ridges and Hemlock, Tamarac, and Black Ash swamps.
All of the swamps are unfit for cultivation although if cleared the Hemlock swamps would produce grass.
The surface is level; the Hardwood ridges are but little elevated above the swamps on which the soil is first and second rate.
This Township is Heavily timbered chiefly with Hemlock, Yellow Birch, Sugar Maple, Lin(?)
and Rock Elm: also considerable White Pine scattered(?)
over the Township.
There are numerous(?)
small creeks in the Township generally lined with alders and some of them have small mashes on them which afford good Hay(?).
No improvements in the Township.
On the East side of the township exists pretty strong local attraction"
