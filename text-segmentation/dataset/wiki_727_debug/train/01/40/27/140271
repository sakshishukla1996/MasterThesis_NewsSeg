========,1,preface.
The Kardashev scale is a method of measuring a civilization's level of technological advancement, based on the amount of energy a civilization is able to use for communication.
The scale has three designated categories:
***LIST***.
The scale is hypothetical, and regards energy consumption on a cosmic scale.
It was proposed in 1964 by the Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev.
Various extensions of the scale have since been proposed, including a wider range of power levels (types 0, IV and V) and the use of metrics other than pure power.
========,2,Current status of human civilization.
Michio Kaku suggested that humans may attain Type I status in 100–200 years, Type II status in a few thousand years, and Type III status in 100,000 to a million years.
Carl Sagan suggested defining intermediate values (not considered in Kardashev's original scale) by interpolating and extrapolating the values given above for types I (10 W), II (10 W) and III (10 W), which would produce the formula
where value "K" is a civilization's Kardashev rating and "P" is the power it uses, in watts.
Using this extrapolation, a "Type 0" civilization, not defined by Kardashev, would control about 1 MW of power, and humanity's civilization type as of 1973 was about 0.7 (apparently using 10 terawatt (TW) as the value for 1970s humanity).
In 2012, total world energy consumption was 553 exajoules (=153,611 TWh), equivalent to an average power consumption of 17.54 TW (or 0.7244 on Sagan's Kardashev scale).
In 2015, total world energy consumption was 550.451 exajoules (=13147.3 million BBL), equivalent to an average power consumption of 17.35 TW (or 0.7239 on Sagan's Kardashev scale).
This represents a 1.08% drop over 3 years.
========,2,Observational evidence.
In 2015, a study of galactic mid-infrared emissions came to the conclusion that "Kardashev Type-III civilizations are either very rare or do not exist in the local Universe".
On October 14, 2015, the detection of an unusual light curve for star KIC 8462852 raised speculation that a Dyson Sphere (Type II civilization) may have been discovered.
The SETI Institute's initial radio reconnaissance of KIC 8462852, however, found no evidence of technology-related radio signals from the star.
In 2016, Paul Glister, author of the Centauri Dreams website, described a signal apparently from the star HD 164595 as requiring the power of a Type I or Type II civilization, if produced by extraterrestrial lifeform.
However, in August 2016 it was discovered that the signal's origin was most likely a military satellite orbiting the Earth.
========,2,Civilization implications.
There are many historical examples of human civilization undergoing large-scale transitions, such as the Industrial Revolution.
The transition between Kardashev scale levels could potentially represent similarly dramatic periods of social upheaval, since they entail surpassing the hard limits of the resources available in a civilization's existing territory.
A common speculation suggests that the transition from Type 0 to Type I might carry a strong risk of self-destruction since, in some scenarios, there would no longer be room for further expansion on the civilization's home planet, as in a Malthusian catastrophe.
Excessive use of energy without adequate disposal of heat, for example, could plausibly make the planet of a civilization approaching Type I unsuitable to the biology of the dominant life-forms and their food sources.
If Earth is an example, then sea temperatures in excess of would jeopardize marine life and make the cooling of mammals to temperatures suitable for their metabolism difficult if not impossible.
Of course, these theoretical speculations may not become problems in reality thanks to evolution or the application of future engineering and technology.
Also, by the time a civilization reaches Type I it may have colonized other planets or created O'Neill-type colonies, so that waste heat could be distributed throughout the planetary system.
========,2,Extensions to the original scale.
Many extensions and modifications to the Kardashev scale have been proposed.
***LIST***.
According to this scale, humans, having wide expertise in various branches of Chemistry and Biology have passed the stage of Type III- minus.
Type IV-minus (that have had practical and widespread applications) have been seen in areas like nanotechnology, semiconductors, materials science and genetic engineering.
While Type V-minus has seen large scale application in the field and subfields of nuclear physics.
Type VI-minus has had tentative research in the field of particle physics with particle colliders such as the Large Hadron Collider.
***LIST***.
========,2,Criticism.
It has been argued that, because we cannot understand advanced civilizations, we cannot predict their behavior.
Thus, the Kardashev scale may not be relevant or useful for classifying extraterrestrial civilizations.
This central argument is found in the book "".
