========,1,preface.
In mathematics, the common logarithm is the logarithm with base 10.
It is also known as the decadic logarithm and also as the decimal logarithm, named after its base, or Briggsian logarithm, after Henry Briggs, an English mathematician who pioneered its use, as well as "standard logarithm".
Historically, it was known as "logarithmus decimalis" or "logarithmus decadis".
It is indicated by log("x"), or sometimes Log("x") with a capital "L" (however, this notation is ambiguous since it can also mean the complex natural logarithmic multi-valued function).
On calculators it is usually "log", but mathematicians usually mean natural logarithm (logarithm with base e ≈ 2.71828) rather than common logarithm when they write "log".
To mitigate this ambiguity the ISO 80000 specification recommends that log("x") should be written lg ("x") and log("x") should be ln ("x").
========,2,History.
Common logarithms are sometimes also called "Briggsian logarithms" after Henry Briggs, a 17th-century British mathematician.
In 1616 and 1617 Briggs visited John Napier, the inventor of what are now called natural (base-e) logarithms at Edinburgh in order to suggest a change to Napier's logarithms.
During these conferences the alteration proposed by Briggs was agreed upon; and after his return from his second visit, he published the first chiliad of his logarithms.
Because base 10 logarithms were most useful for computations, engineers generally simply wrote "log("x")" when they meant log("x").
Mathematicians, on the other hand, wrote "log("x")" when they meant log("x") for the natural logarithm.
Today, both notations are found.
Since hand-held electronic calculators are designed by engineers rather than mathematicians, it became customary that they follow engineers' notation.
So the notation, according to which one writes "ln("x")" when the natural logarithm is intended, may have been further popularized by the very invention that made the use of "common logarithms" far less common, electronic calculators.
========,2,Numeric value.
The numerical value for logarithm to the base 10 can be calculated with the following identity.
as procedures exist for determining the numerical value for logarithm base "e" and logarithm base 2.
