========,2,Early years: 1990s.
Vibert's first musical output was in a variety of bands, including a punk act called Five Minute Fashion and later a Beastie Boys-esque group called the Hate Brothers, but he quickly moved into the low-cost environment of solo electronic composition.
Vibert grew up in Cornwall and attended the Wesleyan Methodist Truro School along with a number of key members of Aphex Twin's Rephlex Records crew.
Luke and another school friend, Jeremy Simmonds, released an album on Rephlex under the name of "Vibert/Simmonds" which attracted attention from the Rising High music label.
As a result of the popularity of the style in the early 1990s, Rising High commissioned an ambient music album from Vibert, who delivered "Phat Lab Nightmare" under the alias Wagon Christ in 1993.
He would go on further over the next few years to produce more music under the Wagon Christ name for Rising High and Ninja Tune, as well as introducing more aliases such as Plug (drum and bass/jungle), with the 1996 album 'Drum and Bass for Papa'.
========,2,2000 and onwards.
In late 1999 and 2000, Vibert began touring with BJ Cole to promote their fusion album "Stop the Panic".
In 2002, he would begin a series of live collaborations with Aphex Twin.
Although Aphex Twin and Luke Vibert never released an album together, Aphex Twin used the song name "Analord", from Vibert's album "Lover's Acid", for a series of EPs.
Vibert's later releases varied in style as he released albums under various names, including Plug, Amen Andrews, Kerrier District and Spac Hand Luke.
"Amen Andrews" is a word play on the name of Irish game show host Eamonn Andrews, referring to the fact that each Amen Andrews track uses the Amen break.
In 2004, Vibert explored acid disco when he remixed a Black Devil song, which was released on "Disco Club (Remix)" and released his first album under the alias Kerrier District.
In 2006, Vibert's song "Shadows" was featured on the DJ mix album "A Bugged Out Mix" by Miss Kittin, which charted at number one-hundred seventy on the French Albums Chart.
