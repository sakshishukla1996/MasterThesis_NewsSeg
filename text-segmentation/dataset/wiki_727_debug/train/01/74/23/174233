========,1,preface.
George Hunt Pendleton (July 19, 1825November 24, 1889) was a Representative and a Senator from Ohio.
Nicknamed "Gentleman George" for his demeanor, he was the Democratic nominee for Vice President of the United States, during the American Civil War, in 1864, as a Peace Democrat with War Democrat George B. McClellan; they lost to Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson.
He is, however, best known as the principal author of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883.
========,2,Early life.
Pendleton was born in Cincinnati, Ohio.
He was the son of Nathanael Greene Pendleton and attended the local schools and Cincinnati College and the University of Heidelberg in Germany.
Pendleton studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1847 and commenced practice in Cincinnati.
He married Alice Key, the daughter of Francis Scott Key, in 1846 and had four children:

========,2,Prewar political career.
He was a member of the Ohio Senate from 1854 to 1856.
In 1854, he ran unsuccessfully for the Thirty-fourth United States Congress.
Three years later, he was elected as a Democrat to the Thirty-fifth Congress and would be re-elected to the three following Congresses (March 4, 1857 â€“ March 3, 1865).
During his time in the House of Representatives, he was one of the managers appointed by the House of Representatives in 1862 to conduct the impeachment proceedings against West H. Humphreys, a US judge for several districts of Tennessee.
He was a leader of the peace faction of his party, with close ties to the Copperheads.
He voted against the Thirteenth Amendment, which outlawed slavery and involuntary servitude.
========,3,National Politics.
Pendleton ran as an antiwar Democrat in the 1864 presidential elections for Vice President, together with George McClellan.
Their opponents were Lincoln (President) and Andrew Johnson (nominee for Vice President).
At 39, Pendleton was one of the youngest candidates for national office in US history.
McClellan and Pendleton lost, receiving about 45% of the vote.
In the same election, Pendleton also lost re-election to the Thirty-ninth Congress.
========,2,Out of office.
Out of office for the first time in a decade, Pendleton ran for his old House seat in 1866 but lost.
In 1868, he sought the Democratic Party's presidential nomination.
He led for the first 15 ballots and was nearly the nominee, but his support disappeared and he lost to Horatio Seymour, primarily for his support of the "Ohio idea."
The following year, he was the Democratic nominee for Governor of Ohio and again lost, this time to Rutherford B. Hayes.
Pendleton stepped away from politics, and in 1869, he became president of the Kentucky Central Railroad.
========,2,Political comeback.
In 1879, he made his comeback when he was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate.
During his only term, from 1881 to 1885, he served concurrently as the Chairman of the Democratic Conference.
Following the 1881 assassination of James A. Garfield, he passed his most notable legislation, known as the Pendleton Act of 1883, requiring civil service exams for government positions.
The Act helped put an end to the system of patronage in widespread use at the time, but it cost Pendelton politically, as many members of his own party preferred the spoils system.
He was thus not renominated to the Senate.
========,2,Later life.
Instead, President Grover Cleveland appointed him Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Germany the year that he left office, which he served until April 1889.
Five months later, during his return trip to the United States, he died in Brussels, Belgium.
He is interred in Spring Grove Cemetery, Cincinnati, Ohio.
========,2,Beliefs.
Pendleton had a very Jacksonian commitment to the Democratic Party as the best, perhaps the only, mechanism through which ordinary Americans could shape government policies.
Mach (2007) argues that Pendleton's chief contribution was to demonstrate the Whig Party's willingness to use its power in government to achieve Jacksonian ideals.
While his Jacksonian commitment to states' rights and limited government made him a dissenter during the Civil War, what Mach calls Pendleton's Jacksonian "ardor to expand opportunities for ordinary Americans" was the basis for his leadership in civil service reform and his controversial plan to use greenbacks to repay the federal debt.
What appeared to be a substantive ideological shift, Mach argues, represented Pendleton's pragmatic willingness to use new means to achieve old ends.
========,2,Memorials.
The city of Pendleton, Oregon, is named after him.
The George H. Pendleton House in Cincinnati is a National Historical Landmark and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966.
