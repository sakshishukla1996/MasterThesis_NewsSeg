========,1,preface.
Carole King (born Carol Joan Klein, February 9, 1942) is an American composer and singer-songwriter.
She is the most successful female songwriter of the latter half of the 20th century, having written or co-written 118 pop hits on the "Billboard" Hot 100 between 1955 and 1999.
King also wrote 61 hits that charted in the UK, making her the most successful female songwriter on the UK singles charts between 1952 and 2005.
King's career began in the 1960s when she, along with her then husband Gerry Goffin, wrote more than two dozen chart hits for numerous artists, many of which have become standards.
She has continued writing for other artists since then.
King's success as a performer in her own right did not come until the 1970s, when she sang her own songs, accompanying herself on the piano, in a series of albums and concerts.
After experiencing commercial disappointment with her debut album "Writer", King scored her breakthrough with the album "Tapestry", which topped the U.S. album chart for 15 weeks in 1971 and remained on the charts for more than six years.
King has made 25 solo albums, the most successful being "Tapestry", which held the record for most weeks at No.
1 by a female artist for more than 20 years.
Her most recent non-compilation album was "Live at the Troubadour" in 2010, a collaboration with James Taylor that reached number 4 on the charts in its first week and has sold over 600,000 copies.
Her records sales were estimated at more than 75 million copies worldwide.
She has won four Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for her songwriting.
She is the recipient of the 2013 Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song, the first woman to be so honored.
She is also a 2015 Kennedy Center Honoree.
========,2,Early life and education.
King was born Carol Joan Klein in February 1942 in Manhattan, to a Jewish family.
Her mother, Eugenia (née Cammer), was a teacher, and her father, Sidney N. Klein, was a firefighter for the New York City Fire Department.
They met in an elevator when they were students at Brooklyn College in 1936.
He was majoring in chemistry while her mother's major was English and drama.
They married in 1937, during the end of the Great Depression.
Her mother dropped out to run the household while her father also quit college and briefly took a job as a radio announcer.
With the economy struggling, he then took a more secure job as a firefighter in New York.
After King was born, they remained in Brooklyn, eventually able to buy a small two-story duplex where they could rent the upstairs for income.
Her mother had learned how to play piano as a child and, after buying a piano, would sometimes practice.
Carol had an insatiable curiosity about music in general from the time she was about three years old, so her mother began teaching her some very basic piano skills, but did not give Carol actual lessons.
When Carol was four years old, her parents discovered she had developed a sense of relative pitch, which enabled her to often name a note correctly by just hearing it.
Her father enjoyed showing off his daughter's skill to visiting friends: "My dad's smile was so broad that it encompassed the lower half of his face.
I enjoyed making my father happy and getting the notes right."
Carol's mother then began giving her real music lessons when she was four years old.
She would climb up on the stool and be raised as yet higher by sitting on a phone book.
With her mother sitting alongside, Carol was taught music theory and elementary piano technique, including how to read notation and execute proper note timing.
King wanted to learn as much as possible: "My mother never forced me to practice.
She didn't have to.
I wanted so much to master the popular songs that poured out of the radio."
Carol began kindergarten when she was four years old, but after her first year she was promoted directly to second grade because she had an exceptional facility with words and numbers.
In the 1950s she went to James Madison High School.
She formed a band called the Co-Sines, changed her name to Carole King, and made demo records with her friend Paul Simon for $25 a session.
Her first official recording was the promotional single "The Right Girl", released by ABC-Paramount in 1958, which she wrote and sang to an arrangement by Don Costa.
She attended Queens College, where she met Gerry Goffin, who was to become her song-writing partner.
When she was 17, they married in a Jewish ceremony on Long Island in August 1959 after King had become pregnant with her first daughter, Louise.
They quit college and took daytime jobs, Goffin working as an assistant chemist and King as a secretary.
They wrote songs together in the evening.
Neil Sedaka, who had dated King when he was still in high school, had a hit in 1959 with "Oh!
Goffin took the tune and wrote the playful response "Oh!
Neil", which King recorded and released as a single the same year.
The B-side contained the Goffin-King song "A Very Special Boy".
The single was not a success.
After writing The Shirelles' "Billboard" Hot 100 #1 hit "Will You Love Me Tomorrow", the first No.1 hit by a black girl group, Goffin and King gave up the daytime jobs to concentrate on writing.
"Will You Love Me Tomorrow" became a standard.
========,2,1960s.
During the sixties, with King writing the music and Goffin the lyrics, the two wrote a string of classic songs for a variety of artists.
King and Goffin were also the songwriting team behind Don Kirshner's Dimension Records, which produced songs including "Chains" (later covered by the Beatles), "The Loco-Motion" for their babysitter Little Eva, and "It Might as Well Rain Until September" which King recorded herself in 1962—her first hit.
King would record a few follow-up singles in the wake of "September", but none of them sold much, and her already sporadic recording career was entirely abandoned (albeit temporarily) by 1966.
Other songs of King's early period (through 1967) include "Half Way To Paradise" [Tony Orlando, covered by Billy Fury in U.K.], "Take Good Care of My Baby" for Bobby Vee, "Up on the Roof" for the Drifters, "I'm into Something Good" for Earl-Jean (later covered by Herman's Hermits), "One Fine Day" for The Chiffons, "Pleasant Valley Sunday" for the Monkees (inspired by their move to suburban West Orange, New Jersey), and "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman" for Aretha Franklin.
By 1968, Goffin and King were divorced and were starting to lose contact.
King moved to Laurel Canyon in Los Angeles with her two daughters and reactivated her recording career by forming "The City", a music trio consisting of Charles Larkey, her future husband, on bass; Danny Kortchmar on guitar and vocals; and King on piano and vocals.
The City produced one album, "Now That Everything's Been Said" in 1968, but King's reluctance to perform live meant sales were slow.
A change of distributors meant that the album was quickly deleted; the group disbanded in 1969.
The album was re-discovered by Classic Rock radio in the early 1980s and the cut "Snow Queen" received nominal airplay for a few years.
Cleveland's WMMS played it every few weeks from 1981 to 1985, and the long-out-of-print LP became sought after by fans of Carole King who like the edgy sound of the music.
========,2,1970s, "Tapestry".
While in Laurel Canyon, King met James Taylor and Joni Mitchell as well as Toni Stern, with whom she would collaborate on songs.
King made her first solo album, "Writer", in 1970 for Lou Adler's Ode label, with Taylor playing acoustic guitar and providing backing vocals.
It peaked at number 84 in the "Billboard" Top 200.
The same year, King played keyboards on B.B.
King's album "Indianola Mississippi Seeds".
King followed "Writer" in 1971 with "Tapestry", which featured new compositions as well as reinterpretations of "Will You Love Me Tomorrow" and "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman."
The album was recorded concurrently with Taylor's "Mud Slide Slim," with an overlapping set of musicians including King, Danny Kortchmar and Joni Mitchell.
Both albums included "You've Got a Friend", which was a number 1 hit for Taylor; King said in a 1972 interview that she "didn't write it with James or anybody really specifically in mind.
But when James heard it he really liked it and wanted to record it".
"Tapestry" was an instant success.
With numerous hit singles – including a "Billboard" No.1 with "It's Too Late" – "Tapestry" held the No.1 spot for 15 consecutive weeks, remained on the charts for nearly six years, and has sold over 25 million copies worldwide.
The album garnered four Grammy Awards including Album of the Year; Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female; Record of the Year ("It's Too Late," lyrics by Toni Stern); and Song of the Year, with King becoming the first woman to win the award ("You've Got a Friend").
The album appeared on Rolling Stone's "500 Greatest Albums of All Time" list at number 36.
In addition, "It's Too Late" was number 469 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.
"Carole King: Music" was released in December 1971, certified gold on December 9, 1971.
It entered the top ten at 8, becoming the first of many weeks "Tapestry" and "Carole King: Music" simultaneously occupied the top 10.
The following week it rose to No.3 and finally to No.1 on January 1, 1972, staying there for three weeks.
The album also spawned a top 10 hit, "Sweet Seasons" (US No.9 and AC No.2).
"Carole King: Music" stayed on the "Billboard" pop album charts for 44 weeks and was eventually certified platinum.
"Rhymes and Reasons" (1972), and "Fantasy" (1973) followed, each earning gold certifications.
"Rhymes and Reasons" produced another hit, "Been to Canaan" (US No.24 and AC No.1), and "Fantasy" produced two hits, "Believe in Humanity" (US No.28) and "Corazon" (US No.37 and AC No.5), as well as another song that charted on the Hot 100, "You Light Up My Life" (US No.67 and AC No.6).
In 1973, King performed a free concert in New York City's Central Park with 100,000 attending.
In September 1974, King released her album "Wrap Around Joy," which was certified gold on October 16, 1974, and entered the top ten at 7 on October 19, 1974.
Two weeks later it reached 1 and stayed there one week.
"Wrap Around Joy" spawned two hits.
"Jazzman" was a single and reached 2 on November 9 but fell out of the top ten the next week.
"Nightingale", a single on December 17, went to No.
9 on March 1, 1975.
In 1975, King scored songs for the animated TV production of Maurice Sendak's "Really Rosie", released as an album by the same name, with lyrics by Sendak.
"Thoroughbred" (1976) was the last studio album she made under the Ode label.
In addition to enlisting her long-time friends such as David Crosby, Graham Nash, James Taylor and Waddy Wachtel, King reunited with Gerry Goffin to write four songs for the album.
Their partnership continued intermittently.
King also did a promotional tour for the album in 1976.
In 1977, King collaborated with another songwriter, Rick Evers, on "Simple Things", the first release with a new label distributed by Capitol Records.
Shortly after that King and Evers were married; he died of a cocaine overdose one year later, while King and daughter Sherry were in Hawaii.
"Simple Things" was her first album that failed to reach the top 10 on the "Billboard" since "Tapestry", and it was her last Gold-certified record by the RIAA, except for a compilation entitled "Her Greatest Hits" the following year and "Live at the Troubadour" in 2010.
Despite its Gold-certified record status, "Simple Things" was named "The Worst Album of 1977" by "Rolling Stone" magazine.
Neither "Welcome Home" (1978), her debut as a co-producer on an album, nor "Touch the Sky" (1979) reached the top 100.
"Pearls – The Songs of Goffin and King" (1980) yielded a hit single, an updated version of "One Fine Day".
========,2,1980s.
King moved to Atlantic Records for "One to One" (1982), and "Speeding Time" in 1983, which was a reunion with "Tapestry"-era producer Lou Adler.
After a well-received concert tour in 1984, journalist Catherine Foster of the "Christian Science Monitor" dubbed King "a Queen of Rock".
She also called King's performing "all spunk and exuberance."
In 1985, she wrote and performed "Care-A-Lot", the theme to "The Care Bears Movie".
Also in 1985, she scored and performed (with David Sanborn) the soundtrack to the Martin Ritt-directed movie "Murphy's Romance".
The soundtrack, again produced by Adler, included the songs "Running Lonely" and "Love For The Last Time (Theme from 'Murphy's Romance')", although a soundtrack album was apparently never officially released.
King made a cameo appearance in the film as Tillie, a town hall employee.
In 1989, she returned to Capitol Records and recorded "City Streets", with Eric Clapton on two tracks and Branford Marsalis on one, followed by "Color of Your Dreams" (1993), with an appearance by Slash.
Her song, "Now and Forever", was in the opening credits to the 1992 movie "A League of Their Own", and was nominated for a Grammy Award.
In 1988, she starred in the off-Broadway production "A Minor Incident", and in 1994, she played Mrs Johnstone on Broadway in "Blood Brothers".
In 1996, she appeared in "Brighton Beach Memoirs" in Ireland, directed by Peter Sheridan.
========,2,1990s.
Early 1991 saw King's song "It's Too Late" covered by Dina Carroll on the Quartz album "Perfect Timing".
The cover topped the dance charts worldwide and reached No.8 in the UK Singles Chart in 1991.
It was hoped that King would appear in the filming of the video for the song but she declined, citing her heavy tour schedule at that time.
In 1991, King co-wrote and co-produced "If It's Over" with singer-songwriter Mariah Carey from her second album "Emotions".
King saw Carey perform her first single "Vision of Love" live and began taking an interest in her and her material.
She contacted Carey, asking if she would be interested in covering "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman", a song she had written alongside Gerry Goffin for Aretha Franklin.
Carey declined, feeling uneasy about covering a song one of her musical influences had executed so perfectly.
Still determined to work with Carey, King flew out to New York City for one day, in hopes of writing and composing a ballad of some sort.
Throughout the day, the two songwriters exchanged musical ideas and melodies on the piano until "If It's Over" came into conception.
In 1997, she wrote "Wall Of Smiles/Torre De Marfil" with Soraya for her 1997 album of the same title.
the same year King wrote and recorded backing vocals on "The Reason" for Celine Dion on her album "Let's Talk About Love".
The song sold worldwide, including one million in France.
It went to number 1 in France, 11 in the UK, and 13 in Ireland.
The pair performed a duet on the first VH1 Divas Live benefit concert.
King also performed her "You've Got A Friend" with Celine Dion, Gloria Estefan and Shania Twain as well as "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman" with Aretha Franklin and others, including Mariah Carey.
In 1998, King wrote "Anyone at All", and performed it in "You've Got Mail", starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.
========,2,2000s.
In 2001, King appeared in a television ad for the Gap, with her daughter, Louise Goffin.
She performed a new song, "Love Makes the World", which became a title track for her studio album in autumn 2001 on her own label, Rockingale, distributed by Koch Records.
The album includes songs she wrote for other artists during the mid-1990s and features Celine Dion, Steven Tyler, Babyface and k.d.
"Love Makes the World" went to 158 in the US and No.
86 in the UK.
It also debuted on "Billboard"′s Top Independent Albums chart and Top Internet Albums chart at No.
An expanded edition of the album was issued six years later called "Love Makes the World Deluxe Edition".
It contains a bonus disc with five additional tracks, including a remake of "Where You Lead (I Will Follow)" co-written with Toni Stern.

The album also charted at 51 in Australia.
It has sold 330,000 copies in the United States.
In August 2006 the album re-entered the "Billboard" 200 at 151.

A DVD of the tour, called "Welcome to My Living Room", was released in October 2007.
In November 2007, King toured Japan with Mary J. Blige and Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas.
Japanese record labels Sony and Victor reissued most of King's albums, including the works from the late 1970s previously unavailable on compact disc.
King recorded a duet of the Goffin/King composition "Time Don't Run Out on Me" with Anne Murray on Murray's 2007 album "".
The song had previously been recorded by Murray for her 1984 album "Heart Over Mind".
========,2,2010-present.
In 2010, King and James Taylor staged their Troubadour Reunion Tour together, recalling the first time they played at The Troubadour, West Hollywood in 1970.
The pair had reunited two and a half years earlier in 2007 with the band they used in 1970 to mark the club's 50th anniversary.
They enjoyed it so much that they decided to take the band on the road for 2010.
The touring band featured players from that original band: Russ Kunkel, Leland Sklar, and Danny Kortchmar.
Also present was King's son-in-law, Robbie Kondor.
King played piano and Taylor guitar on each other's songs, and they sang together some of the numbers they were both associated with.
The tour began in Australia in March, returning to the United States in May.
It was a major commercial success, with King playing to some of the largest audiences of her career.
Total ticket sales exceeded 700,000 and the tour grossed over 59 million dollars, making it one of the most successful tours of the year.
During their Troubadour Reunion Tour, Carole King released two albums, one with James Taylor.
