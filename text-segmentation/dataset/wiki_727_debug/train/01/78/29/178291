The area of Rauland was separated from Vinje in 1860 to become a municipality of its own.
On 1 January 1964 Rauland was merged back into the municipality of Vinje.
Rauland has since been part of the larger Vinje municipality.
The local traditions of arts and crafts have been well maintained, and Rauland hosts a national academy for arts, crafts and traditional music.
Vinje became a site of heavy battles during World War II, at the Battle of Vinjesvingen when Norwegian forces held out for over a month against superior German forces.

Vinje is situated on both the Hardangervidda plateau and parts of the Setesdalsheiene mountain plateaus.
European route E134 passes through Vinje, which is located halfway between Oslo and Haugesund on Norway’s west coast.
Starting at Haukeli, Norwegian National Road 9 leads up the steep slopes to Hovden and further south down the Setesdal to Kristiansand.
The mountain ski resort Haukelifjell is also found nearby.
The isolated and sparsely populated area is known for its rugged, mountainous terrain that supports a wide variety of outdoor activities, amongst them hiking, mountain biking, snowboarding, skiing, fishing, and canoeing.
Arabygdi lies on Lake Totak in the western part of Rauland.
Its famous attraction is the "Urdbøuri", the largest stone scree in Northern Europe, with huge boulders scattered on the floor of the valley.
