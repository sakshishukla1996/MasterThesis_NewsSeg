The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Bø i Telemark ("Bø in Telemark").

The area of Lunde was separated from Bø in 1867 to become a separate municipality.

Bø is well known for its cultural traditions within traditional music and artisanship, and its central position within Norwegian national romanticism with e.g.
its "Bunad" traditions.
Bø has several times been called "the most beautiful place on earth" in modern literature, e.g.
in Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson's story, "En glad Gut" ("A Happy Boy").
========,2,General information.
========,3,Name.
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old "Bø" farm (Old Norse: "Bœr"), since the first church was built here.
The name is identical with the word "bœr" which means "homestead" or "farm".
========,3,Coat-of-arms.
The coat-of-arms is from modern times.
They were adopted on 19 February 1988.
The arms show three gold-colored fiddles on a red background.
Bø is historically known for its musical tradition, as well as the production of fiddles (similar to the hardingfele).
The fiddle was thus chosen as an appropriate symbol for the municipality.
========,2,Education.
In 1923 the county of Telemark decided to start a secondary school in Bø, the equivalent of today's middle school or "ungdomsskole", called Telemark Realskole.
At this time secondary schools mostly existed in the larger towns and cities, and most youngsters ended their schooling after 7 years.
It was the county's intention to expand this school to a high school as soon as practically possible.
This happened in 1947, and the school's name was Telemark Offentlige Landsgymnas.
The existence of this school made it possible to establish Telemark College ("Distriktshøgskulen i Telemark"), which evolved into Telemark University College.
