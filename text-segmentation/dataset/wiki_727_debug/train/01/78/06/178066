The first element in the name of the island is "eik" which means "oak" and the last element is the suffix "-und" which means "plentiful of" (i.e.
"the island covered with oak trees").
***LIST***.
The form of the name spelled without the diphthong [ei] ("Egersund") is the Danish language form of the name which is still preserved in the name of the town Egersund, but the municipality name is spelled using the Norwegian language form.
========,3,Coat-of-arms.
The coat-of-arms are relatively modern; they were granted on 20 October 1972.

The arms are partly a canting since the name is supposedly derived from "Eikundarsund" and "eik" means oak.
Oaks are also very common in the municipality.
