========,1,preface.
Kimchi (; , ), a staple in Korean cuisine, is a traditional side dish made from salted and fermented vegetables, most commonly napa cabbage and Korean radishes, with a variety of seasonings including chili powder, scallions, garlic, ginger, and "jeotgal" (salted seafood).
There are hundreds of varieties of kimchi made with different vegetables as the main ingredients.
In traditional preparations, kimchi was stored underground in jars to keep cool, and unfrozen during the winter months.
These days, kimchi refrigerators are used instead.
========,2,Etymology.
========,3,"Ji".
The term "ji" (), which has its origins in archaic Korean "dihi" (), has been used to refer to kimchi since ancient times.
The sound change can be roughly described as:
***LIST***.
The Middle Korean form "dihi" is found in several books from "Joseon" (1392–1897).
In Modern Korean, the word remains as the suffix "-ji" in the standard language (as in "jjanji", "seokbak-ji"), and as the suffix "-ji" as well as the noun "ji" in Gyeongsang and Jeolla dialects.
The unpalatalized form "di" is preserved in P'yŏngan dialect.
========,3,"Gimchi".
"Gimchi" () is the accepted word in both North and South Korean standard languages.
Earlier forms of the word include "timchɑi" (), a Middle Korean transcription of the Sino-Korean word (literally "submerged vegetable").
"Timchɑi" appears in "Sohak Eonhae", the 16th century Korean rendition of the Chinese book, "Xiaoxue" (in Korean, "Sohak").
Sound changes from Middle Korean to Modern Korean regarding the word can be described as:
***LIST***.
The aspirated first consonant of "timchɑi" became unaspirated in "dimchɑi", then underwent palatalization in "jimchɑi".
The word then became "jimchui" with the loss of the vowel "ɑ" () in Korean language, then "gimchi", with the depalatalized word-initial consonant.
In Modern Korean, the hanja characters are pronounced "chimchae" (), and are not used to refer to kimchi, or anything else.
The word "gimchi" is not considered as a Sino-Korean word.
Older forms of the word are retained in many regional dialects: "jimchae" (Jeolla, Hamgyŏng dialects), "jimchi" (Chungcheong, Gangwon, Gyeonggi, Gyeongsang, Hamgyŏng, Jeolla dialects), and "dimchi" (P'yŏngan dialect).
The English word "kimchi" perhaps originated from "kimch'i", the McCune–Reischauer transcription of the Korean word "gimchi" ().
========,2,History.
The origin of kimchi dates back at least to the early period of the Three Kingdoms (37 BCE‒7 CE).
Fermented foods were widely available, as the "Records of the Three Kingdoms", a Chinese historical text published in 289 AD, mentions that "The "Goguryeo" people [referring to the Korean people] are skilled in making fermented foods such as wine, soybean paste and salted and fermented fish" in the section named "Dongyi" in the "Book of Wei".
"Samguk Sagi", a historical record of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, also mentions the pickle jar used to ferment vegetables, which indicates that fermented vegetables were commonly eaten during this time.
A poem on Korean radish written by Yi Gyubo, a 13th century literatus, shows that radish kimchi was a commonplace in Goryeo (918–1392).
However, early records of kimchi do not mention garlic or chili peppers.
Kimchi was not red until the late 16th century, when chili peppers were introduced to Korea by Portuguese traders based in Nagasaki, Japan.
The first mention of chili pepper is found in "Jibong yuseol", an encyclopedia published in 1614.
"Sallim gyeongje", a 17‒18th century book on farm management, wrote on kimchi with chili peppers.
However, it was not until the 19th century that the use of chili peppers in kimchi was widespread.
The recipes from early 19th century closely resemble today's kimchi.
A 1766 book, "Jeungbo sallim gyeongje", reports kimchi varieties made with myriad of ingredients, including "chonggak-kimchi" (kimchi made with chonggak raddish), "oi-sobagi" (with cucumber), "seokbak-ji" (with "jogi-jeot"), and "dongchimi".
However, napa cabbage was only introduced to Korea at the end of 19th century, and whole-cabbage kimchi similar to its current form is described in "Siuijeonseo", a cookbook published around that time.
Kimchi is a national dish of both North and South Korea.
During South Korea's involvement in the Vietnam War its government requested American help to ensure that South Korean troops, reportedly "desperate" for the food, could obtain it in the field; South Korean president Park Chung-hee told U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson that kimchi was "vitally important to the morale of Korean troops".
It was also sent to space on board Soyuz TMA-12 with South-Korean astronaut Yi So-yeon after a multimillion-dollar research effort to kill the bacteria and lessen the odor without affecting taste.

========,3,Ingredients.
========,4,Vegetables.
Cabbages (napa cabbages, bomdong, headed cabbages) and radishes (Korean radishes, ponytail radishes, gegeol radishes, young summer radishes) are the most commonly used kimchi vegetables.
Other kimchi vegetables include: aster, balloon flower roots, burdock roots, celery, chamnamul, cilantro, cress, crown daisy greens, cucumber, eggplant, garlic chives, garlic scapes, ginger, Korean angelica-tree shoots, Korean parsley, Korean wild chive, lotus roots, mustard greens, onions, perilla leaves, potatoes, pumpkins, radish greens, rapeseed leaves, scallions, soybean sprouts, spinach, sugar beets, sweet potato vines, and tomatoes.
========,4,Seasonings.
Korean sea salt (with a larger grain size and lower sodium content compared to kosher salt) is used mainly for initial salting of kimchi vegetables.
Being minimally processed, it serves to help developing flavours in fermented foods.
Commonly used seasonings include "gochutgaru" (chili powder), scallions, garlics, ginger, and "jeotgal" (salted seafood) "Jeotgal" can be replaced with raw seafood in colder Northern parts of the Korean peninsula.
If used, milder "saeu-jeot" (salted shrimp) or "jogi-jeot" (salted croaker) is preferred and the amount of "jeotgal" is also reduced in Northern and Central regions.
In Southern Korea, on the other hand, generous amount of stronger "myeolchi-jeot" (salted anchovies) and "galchi-jeot" (salted hairtail) is commonly used.
Raw seafood or "daegu-agami-jeot" (salted cod gills) are used in the East coast areas.

========,2,Varieties.
Kimchi is a traditional Korean dish consisting of pickled vegetables, which is mainly served as a side dish with every meal, but also can be served as a main dish.
Kimchi is mainly recognized as a spicy fermented cabbage dish globally, but there are currently more than 200 variations, and continues to grow.
These variations of kimchi continues to grow, and the taste can vary depending on the region and season  Kimchi has been a staple in Korean culture, but historical versions were not a spicy dish.
Theories of the origin of Kimchi varies including a belief that it appeared during the Shilla Dynasty, and became prevalent once Buddhism caught on throughout the nation and fostered a vegetarian lifestyle.
However, the addition of spicy peppers to this cultural dish did not appear until the arrival of Portuguese missionaries in the 1700s who brought chili peppers.
The pickling of vegetables was an ideal method, prior to refrigerators, that helped to preserve the lifespan of foods.
In Korea, kimchi was made during the winter by fermenting vegetables, and burying it in the ground in traditional brown ceramic pots, and further allowed a bonding between women within the family.
Kimchi can be categorized by main ingredients, regions or seasons.
Korea's northern and southern sections have a considerable temperature difference.
There are over 180 varieties of kimchi.
The most common kimchi variations are
***LIST***.
Kimchi from the northern parts of Korea tends to have less salt and red chili and usually does not include brined seafood for seasoning.
Northern kimchi often has a watery consistency.
Kimchi made in the southern parts of Korea, such as Jeolla-do and Gyeongsang-do, uses salt, chili peppers and "myeolchijeot" (, brined anchovy allowed to ferment) or "saeujeot" (, brined shrimp allowed to ferment), "myeolchiaekjeot" (), "kkanariaekjeot" (), liquid anchovy jeot, similar to fish sauce used in Southeast Asia, but thicker.
"Saeujeot" () or "myeolchijeot" is not added to the kimchi spice-seasoning mixture, but is simmered first to reduce odors, eliminate tannic flavor and fats, and then is mixed with a thickener made of rice or wheat starch ().
This technique has been falling into disuse in the past 40 years.
White kimchi ("baek kimchi") is baechu (napa cabbage) seasoned without chili pepper and is neither red in color nor spicy.
White radish kimchi ("dongchimi") is another example of a kimchi that is not spicy.
The watery white kimchi varieties are sometimes used as an ingredient in a number of dishes such as cold noodles in "dongchimi" brine ("dongchimi guksu").
========,3,Seasons.
Different types of kimchi were traditionally made at different times of the year, based on when various vegetables were in season and also to take advantage of hot and cold seasons before the era of refrigeration.
Although the advent of modern refrigeration — including kimchi refrigerators specifically designed with precise controls to keep different varieties of kimchi at optimal temperatures at various stages of fermentation — has made this seasonality unnecessary, Koreans continue to consume kimchi according to traditional seasonal preferences.
========,4,Spring.
After a long period of consuming "gimjang kimchi" () during the winter, fresh potherbs and vegetables were used to make kimchi.
These kinds of kimchi were not fermented or even stored for long periods of time but were consumed fresh.
========,4,Summer.
Young summer radishs and cucumbers are summer vegetables made into kimchi, "yeolmu kimchi" () which is eaten in several bites.
Brined fish or shellfish can be added, and freshly ground dried chili peppers are often used.
========,4,Autumn.
"Baechu kimchi" is prepared by inserting blended stuffing materials, called "sok" (literally "inside"), between layers of salted leaves of uncut, whole Napa cabbage.
The ingredients of "sok" () can vary, depending on the different regions and weather conditions.
Generally, "baechu kimchi" used to have a strong salty flavor until the late 1960s, before which a large amount of "myeolchijeot" or "saeujeot" had been used.
"Gogumasoon Kimchi" is made from sweet potato stems.
========,4,Winter.
Traditionally, the greatest varieties of kimchi were available during the winter.
In preparation for the long winter months, many types of kimjang kimchi () were prepared in early winter and stored in the ground in large kimchi pots.
Today, many city residents use modern kimchi refrigerators offering precise temperature controls to store kimjang kimchi.
November and December are traditionally when people begin to make kimchi; women often gather together in each other's homes to help with winter kimchi preparations.
"Baechu kimchi" is made with salted baechu filled with thin strips of radish, parsley, pine nuts, pears, chestnuts, shredded red pepper, manna lichen (), garlic, and ginger.
========,3,Korean preference.
A 2004 book about vegetable preservation said that the preference of kimchi preparation in Korean households from the most prepared type of kimchi to less prepared types of kimchi was: baechu kimchi, being the most prepared type of kimchi, then kaktugi, then dongchimi and then chonggak kimchi.
The book said that baechu kimchi comprises more than seventy percent of marketed kimchi and radish kimchi comprises about twenty percent of marketed kimchi.
========,2,Nutrition and health.
A 2003 article in the Los Angeles Times said that South Koreans consume of kimchi per person annually.
A 2015 book cited a 2011 source that said that adult Koreans eat from to of kimchi a day.
Some credit Korea's industrious energy as a people, and their nation's rapid economic growth, in part to eating the dish.
Kimchi is made of various vegetables and contains a high concentration of dietary fiber, while being low in calories.
One serving also provides over 50% of the daily recommended amount of vitamin C and carotene.
Most types of kimchi contain onions, garlic, ginger, and chili peppers, all of which are salutary.
The vegetables used in kimchi also contribute to its overall nutritional value.
Kimchi is rich in vitamin A, thiamine (B), riboflavin (B), calcium, and iron, and contains lactic acid bacteria, among those the typical species "Lactobacillus kimchii".
During the 2003 SARS outbreak in Asia, many people believed that kimchi could protect against infection.
While there was no scientific evidence to support this belief, kimchi sales rose by 40%.

========,2,Dishes made with kimchi.
Kimchi is known to be a traditional side dish as it is almost always served along with other side dishes in most Korean family households and restaurants.
Kimchi can be eaten alone or with white rice, but it is also included in recipes of other traditional dishes, including porridges, soups, and rice cakes.
(Jung, C.) Kimchi is also the basis for many derivative dishes such as kimchi stew (), kimchi pancake (), kimchi soup (), and kimchi fried rice ().
========,2,Recent history.
========,3,1996 Japanese kimchi dispute.
In 1996, Korea protested against Japanese commercial production of kimchi arguing that the Japanese-produced product ("kimuchi") was different from kimchi (in particular, Japanese kimuchi was not fermented so it was salted but sweet cabbage).
Korea lobbied for an international standard from the Codex Alimentarius, an organization associated with the World Health Organization that defines voluntary standards for food preparation for international trade purposes.
In 2001, the Codex Alimentarius published a voluntary standard defining kimchi as "a fermented food that uses salted napa cabbages as its main ingredient mixed with seasonings, and goes through a lactic acid production process at a low temperature", but which neither specified a minimum amount of fermentation nor forbade the use of any additives.
========,3,1998 to 2007 motherland tours.
South Korea developed programs for adult Korean adoptees to return to South Korea and learn about what it means to be Korean.
One of these programs was learning how to make kimchi.
========,3,2010 kimchi ingredient price crisis.
Due to heavy rainfall shortening the harvesting time for cabbage and other main ingredients for kimchi in 2010, the price of kimchi ingredients and kimchi itself rose greatly.
Korean and international newspapers described the rise in prices as a national crisis.
Some restaurants stopped offering kimchi as a free side dish, which "The New York Times" compared to an American hamburger restaurant no longer offering free ketchup.
In response to the kimchi price crisis, the South Korean government announced the temporary reduction of tariffs on imported cabbage to coincide with the Kimjang season.
========,3,2012 effective ban of Korean kimchi exports to China.
Since 2012, the Chinese government has effectively banned Korean kimchi exports to China through government regulations.
Ignoring the standards of Kimchi outlined by the Codex Alimentarius, China defined kimchi as a derivative of one of its own cuisines, called pao cai.
However, due to significantly different preparation techniques from pao cai, kimchi has significantly more lactic acid bacteria through its fermentation process, which exceeds China's regulations.
Since 2012, commercial exports of Korean kimchi to China has reached zero, the only minor amounts of exports accounting for Korean kimchi exhibition events held in China.
========,3,Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
Kimchi-related items have been inscribed on UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by both South and North Korea.
This makes kimchi the second intangible heritage that was submitted by two different countries, the other one being the folk song "Arirang", also submitted by the Koreas.
========,4,Submitted by South Korea (inscribed 2013).
Kimjang, the tradition of making and sharing of kimchi that usually takes place in late autumn, was added to the list as "Kimjang, making and sharing kimchi in the Republic of Korea".
The practice of Kimjang reaffirms Korean identity and strengthens family cooperation.
Kimjang is also an important reminder for many Koreans that human communities need to live in harmony with nature.
========,4,Submitted by North Korea (inscribed 2015).
North Korean kimchi-making was inscribed on the list in December 2015 as "Tradition of kimchi-making in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea".
North Korean kimchi tends to be less spicy and red than South Korean kimchi.
========,3,2014 kimchi-making class for Vietnamese brides.
A 2014 article in Tuổi Trẻ said that around 40 Vietnamese brides who had already married or who were going to marry Korean men spent two hours in a class in 2014 to make kimchi and kimbap at the Kim & Kim Company’s factory in the Tân Bình Industrial Zone of Ho Chi Minh City.
The event was arranged by the Kim & Kim Company and the Korean Language Education Center in Ho Chi Minh City.
The class is a free class that has been taught to 30 to 35 women once a month.
Han Ji-sook, the director of the Korean Language Education Center in Ho Chi Minh City, said, "Kimchi is important for Korean people, so anyone who visits the country will experience kimchi or kimchi-making.
Especially for the wives of Korean men, it's important to know how to make kimchi."
Kim Tae-kon, director of the Kim & Kim Company, said, "All of these Vietnamese women who are going to live in Korea must eat kimchi every day, three meals a day.
I'm pleased to give them the chance to learn how to make kimchi."
