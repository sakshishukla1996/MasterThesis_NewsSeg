========,1,preface.
Knödel (), or Klöße () are boiled dumplings commonly found in Central European and East European cuisine.
Central European countries in which their variant of knödel is popular include Austria, Germany, Hungary, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic.
They are also found in Scandinavian, Romanian, Northern eastern Italian cuisine, Ukrainian and Belarusian cuisines.
Usually made from flour, bread or potatoes, they are often served as a side dish, but can also be a dessert such as plum dumplings, or even meat balls in soup.
Many varieties and variations exist.
========,2,Etymology.
The word Knödel is German and derives from the Latin word "nodus" ("knot").
From the Old High German "chnodo" and the Middle High German "knode" it finally changed to the modern expression.
Knödel in Hungary are called "gombóc" or "knédli"; in Slovenia, "knedl(j)i" or (less specifically) "cmoki"; in the Czech Republic, "knedlík" (plural: "knedlíky"); in Slovakia, "knedľa" (plural: "knedlíky"); in Luxembourg, "Kniddel(en)"; in Bosnia, Croatia, Poland and Serbia, "knedle"; and, in Italy, "canederli" .
In some regions of the United States, "klub" is used to refer specifically to potato dumplings.
A similar dish is known in Sweden ("kroppkakor" or "pitepalt") and in Norway, "raspeball" or "komle" filled with salty meat; and in Canada, poutines râpées.
In Bukovina they are known as "cnigle".
========,2,Varieties.
Knödel are used in various dishes in Austrian, German, and Czech cuisine.
From these regions, knödel spread throughout Europe.
At the turn of the 20th century, it was commonly said that a Czech girl is not prepared to marry until she can cook this dish.
