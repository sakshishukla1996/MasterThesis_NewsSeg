========,2,History.
Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe gave the order for Yonge Street to be extended to Holland Landing in 1793, the first step toward the establishment of a community where Aurora now stands.
Yonge Street opened between 1794 and 1796.
In 1795, the first house in Aurora was built at Yonge St and Catherine Av.
The government began granting deeds to land in 1797.
By 1801 there were fourteen homes.
In 1804, Richard Machell became the first merchant at the cross roads of Yonge and Wellington and the hamlet soon became known as Machell's Corners.
Charles Doan was another early businessman at Machell's Corners and became the first postmaster and later the first reeve.
As postmaster, he was influential in renaming the village Aurora.
Flour and grist mills were built around 1827.
With the coming of the railway in 1853, Aurora emerged as an important centre north of Toronto.
The Fleury plough works foundry opened in 1859, making agricultural implements.
The community was first known as Machell's Corners and had only 100 residents in 1851.
The population of Aurora in 1863 was 700, and by 1869 it had grown to 1200.
The settlement was incorporated as a village in 1863 with Charles Doan as the first reeve.
Records from 1885 describe Aurora as the "largest village in the county" an "enterprising and stirring business community" with several factories and mills, five churches, a school house with 210 students, and two weekly newspapers.
The population in 1881 was 1540.
The population reached 2,107 by 1888.
Worthy of note is the fact that Aurora was the childhood home of Lester B. Pearson, Prime Minister of Canada from 1963 to 1968, when his father, Rev.
Edwin Pearson, was the Methodist minister.
Aurora is noted for preserving its historical built form and in 2008 was awarded The Prince of Wales Prize for Municipal Heritage Leadership.
In 2009 the town received the Lieutenant Governor's Ontario Heritage Award for Community Leadership in heritage conservation and promotion.

========,2,Urban planning.
Currently, a largely undeveloped portion of Aurora is subject to the Ontario Government's Greenbelt legislation which enforces limits on growth in designated Green Belt locations.
In Aurora, this affects mostly the south-eastern areas of the town.
Growth is occurring in the north-eastern locations, particularly in the form of high-density residential homes and townhouses along Bayview Ave and north of Wellington St. E. (also known as "Aurora Rd.
"), and commerce along Wellington St. E. on Aurora's eastern border between Leslie St. and Hwy.
Future growth will be concentrated in two greenfield areas of the Town: the 2C Lands, located on the east and west sides of Leslie Street, running north from Aurora Road to the town limit, just north of the St. John's Sideroad.
As part of its current Official Plan review, Aurora Town Council will soon be considering a plan that will see employment lands, worth approximately 6,000 jobs, preserved on the east side of Leslie Street, with residential restricted to the west side of Leslie Street.
========,3,The Aurora Promenade.
One other area of growth will be via intensification along the Yonge and Wellington Street corridors.
As part of the Town's Official Plan review, a sub-committee of Council developed a plan in 2010, called The Aurora Promenade, that sets out new and redevelopment for the coming years.
More than 30 public meetings, open-houses and workshops were held to create the plan.
It is anticipated that 2,930 additional residents will live along the Yonge and Wellington Street corridors, close to new major transportation systems being implemented by VIVA.
The study was expected to stimulate new and redevelopment along both corridors in the coming years and to reinvigorate the downtown core.
========,2,Library.
The Aurora Public Library is located in the northeast corner of the intersection of Yonge Street and Church Street.
A library was first established in Aurora in 1855, and was moved to the current location in 2001.
The library is open all days of the week, but closed on Sundays between May 17 and September 11, and between December 20 and January 2.
