========,1,preface.
Burgrave (from , ) was since the medieval period a title for the ruler of a castle, especially a royal or episcopal castle, as well as a castle district (castellany) or fortified settlement or city.
The burgrave was a "count" in rank (German "Graf", Latin "Comes") equipped with judicial powers.
The title became hereditary in certain feudal families and was associated with a territory or domain called a "Burgraviate" (German "Burggrafschaft", Latin "Prefectura").
The position and office of burgrave could be held either by the king, a nobleman or a bishop, the responsibilities were administrative, military and jurisdictional.
========,2,History.
Etymologically, the word burgrave is the English and French form of the German noble title Burggraf (Burg "Castle" + Graf "Count").
The wife of a burgrave was titled "Burgravine", in German "Burggräfin".
The title is originally equivalent to that of castellan () or French "châtelain"; meaning keeper or commander of a castle and/or fortified settlement (both can be called "Burg" in German).

In Germany, owing to the distinct conditions of the Holy Roman Empire, the title, as borne by feudal nobles having the status of Reichsfürst (Prince of the Empire), obtained a quasi-princely significance.
There were four hereditary burgraviates ranking as principalities within the Holy Roman Empire, plus the burgraviate of Meissen:
