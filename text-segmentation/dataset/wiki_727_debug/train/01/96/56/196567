========,1,preface.
In music, a coda (Italian for "tail", plural "code") is a passage that brings a piece (or a movement) to an end.
Technically, it is an expanded cadence.
It may be as simple as a few measures, or as complex as an entire section.
========,2,Coda in classical music.
The presence of a coda as a structural element in a movement is especially clear in works written in particular musical forms.
Codas were commonly used in both sonata form and variation movements during the Classical era.
In a sonata form movement, the recapitulation section will, in general, follow the exposition in its thematic content, while adhering to the home key.
The recapitulation often ends with a passage that sounds like a termination, paralleling the music that ended the exposition; thus, any music coming after this termination will be perceived as extra material, i.e., as a coda.
In works in variation form, the coda occurs following the last variation and will be very noticeable as the first music not based on the theme.
One of the ways that Beethoven extended and intensified Classical practice was to expand the coda sections, producing a final section sometimes of equal musical weight to the foregoing exposition, development, and recapitulation sections and completing the musical argument.
For one famous example, see Symphony No.
8 (Beethoven).
========,3,Codetta.
Codetta (Italian for "little tail," the diminutive form) has a similar purpose to the coda, but on a smaller scale, concluding a section of a work instead of the work as a whole.
A typical codetta concludes the exposition and recapitulation sections of a work in sonata form, following the second (modulated) theme, or the closing theme (if there is one).
Thus, in the exposition, it usually appears in the secondary key, but, in the recapitulation, in the primary key.
The codetta ordinarily closes with a perfect cadence in the appropriate key, confirming the tonality.
If the exposition is repeated, the codetta is also, but sometimes it has its ending slightly changed, depending on whether it leads back to the exposition or into the development sections.
========,2,History.
Cauda, a Latin word meaning 'tail', 'edge' or 'trail' is the root of "coda" and is used in the study of conductus of the 12th and 13th centuries.
The cauda was a long melisma on one of the last syllables of the text, repeated in each strophe.
Conducti were traditionally divided into two groups, "conductus cum cauda" and "conductus sine cauda" (Latin: "conductus with cauda", "conductus without cauda"), based on the presence of the melisma.
Thus, the cauda provided a conclusionary role, also similar to the modern coda.
========,2,Coda in popular music.
Many songs in rock and other genres of popular music have sections identifiable as codas.
A coda in these genres is sometimes referred to as an "outro", while in jazz, modern church music and barbershop arranging it is commonly called a "tag".
========,2,In music notation.
In music notation, the coda symbol, which resembles a set of crosshairs, is used as a navigation marker, similar to the "dal segno" sign.
It is used where the exit from a repeated section is within that section rather than at the end.
The instruction "To Coda" indicates that, upon reaching that point during the final repetition, the performer is to jump immediately to the separate section headed with the coda symbol.
For example, this can be used to provide a special ending for the final verse of a song.
