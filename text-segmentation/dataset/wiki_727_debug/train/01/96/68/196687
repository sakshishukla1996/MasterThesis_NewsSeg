The SU consists of the executive committee (President, Vice President, Treasurer, Secretary) and other officers (Environment, Charity, Communications, Equality and Diversity, LGBT).
The SU also has a history of organising and coordinating protests and demonstrations on behalf of the student body.
The President of the SU also serves on the board of governors as a student governor, along with one other student governor who is not a member of the SU but is nonetheless democratically elected by the student body.
Amongst the roles of the President is to chair the executive committee, and to organise and chair the Student Parliament.
The SU officers are elected at the start of the academic year with the executive committee elected at the year's end.
Participation in the elections has been boosted in recent years through the use of an online system accessible through the student intranet, this system was introduced for the first time in the executive committee election of April 2012.
The electoral system works on a single transferable vote system, with a re-open nominations option available.
The Student Union is at present affiliated with the National Union of Students (United Kingdom) (NUS).
========,2,Boarding.
Around eighty students board at the two houses; School House and Falkland Lodge.
Boarders are typically from British Armed Forces families or the Falkland Islands.
The college and the Falkland Island's government made an agreement for the college to accommodate students from the Falkland Islands.
A second boarding house, Falkland Lodge, was built as part of this agreement, and was funded by the Falkland Islands.
