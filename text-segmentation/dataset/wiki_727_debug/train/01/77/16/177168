========,1,preface.
The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers is an underground comic about a fictional trio of stoner characters, created by the American artist Gilbert Shelton.
The Freak Brothers first appeared in "The Rag", an underground newspaper published in Austin, Texas, beginning in May 1968, and were regularly reprinted in underground papers around the United States and in other parts of the world.
Later their adventures were published in a series of comic books.
The lives of the Freak Brothers revolve around the procurement and enjoyment of recreational drugs, particularly marijuana.
The comics present a critique of the establishment, while satirizing counterculture.
Fat Freddy's Cat appears in many of the stories, spinning off his own cartoon strip (which appeared as part of the Freak Brothers comic page, in the manner of older comic strip double features) and later some full-length episodes.
========,2,Comic strips.
The Freak Brothers first appeared in "The Rag", an underground newspaper published in Austin, Texas, beginning in May 1968.
Their debut was in an advertising flyer for a winter 1968 film short called "The Texas Hippies March on the Capitol".
Freak Brothers strips soon became popular and were regularly reprinted in underground papers around the United States and in other parts of the world.
The Freak Brothers' first comic book appearance was in "Feds 'n' Heads", self-published by Shelton in the spring of 1968 (and later re-issued in multiple printings by Berkeley's the Print Mint).
They also appeared in the first two issue's of Jay Lynch's "Bijou Funnies".
In 1969 Shelton and three friends from Texas founded Rip Off Press in San Francisco, which took over publication of all subsequent Freak Brothers comics.
The first compilation of their adventures, "The Collected Adventures of the Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers", had its first printing in 1971 and has been continually in print ever since.
In addition to underground and college weekly newspapers, new adventures appeared in magazines such as "Playboy", "High Times", and "Rip Off Comix"; these too were collected in comic book form.
Shelton continued to write the series until 1992, in collaboration with Dave Sheridan (1974–1982) and Paul Mavrides (since 1978).
The works enjoy a sizable cult following and the magazines are widely available in comic stores.
The majority of the comic books consist of one or more multi-page stories together with a number of one-page strips.
Many of the latter have a one-row skit featuring Fat Freddy's Cat at the bottom of the page.
Some of the titles also contain a small number of strips featuring completely unrelated characters.
========,2,Characters.
The Freak Brothers are not siblings.
They are a threesome of freaks (similar to but distinct from hippies) from San Francisco.

========,2,Storylines and themes.
Drug use is the predominant theme that runs throughout all volumes of this title.
The protagonists "live in a state of blissful torpor relieved only by bursts of paranoia or stimulant-induced frenzy."
Marijuana is the most frequently mentioned, but numerous other stimulants and hallucinogens are mentioned as well.
Heroin is usually missing from the list.
In one adventure, Franklin is shown to turn down an offer of "smack" when hitching a ride.
Food is a recurring subject.
These stories most often involve Fat Freddy and his marijuana-induced "munchies" (increased appetite).
The squalor engendered by the Brothers' indolence is often highlighted; several strips feature the household's cockroach population, ruled over by a fascist monarchy.
Several stories satirise governments, particularly the U.S. government.
These stories invariably show politicians and their agents as corrupt, incompetent, or both.
The theme of foreign travel is sometimes explored, most notably in the three-part "Idiots Abroad" series.
It is common for the storylines to begin with an air of realism, but rapidly descend into comic pantomime.

========,3,In film.
In 1973, without permission from Gilbert Shelton, The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers appeared in the full-length pornographic film "Up in Flames", although two of them were given different names.
The story involved the brothers' attempts to raise cash to make their rent deadline (the trio being in danger of being evicted from their apartment).
Fat Freddy gains employment at a local food store run by graphic artist Robert Crumb's character Mr. Natural (also used without permission).
Director Paul Thomas Anderson said the look of Joaquin Phoenix's lead character, Larry "Doc" Sportello, in Anderson's 2014 adaptation of the Thomas Pynchon novel "Inherent Vice", was based in part on characters in the comics.
"[T]here's this documentary on Daniel Ellsberg, called "The Most Dangerous Man in America".
There's a great picture of a buddy of his who has this great set of glasses, a floppy hat and these mutton chops.
I took a still frame from that and I sent it to [Phoenix], along with the omnibus collection of "The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers" comic, by Gilbert Shelton — and that's probably the most we really talked about [Phoenix's portrayal of the character]."
========,3,In animation.
In 2006, the company "Grass Roots Films" began production on a feature-length clay-animation film based on the series, called "Grass Roots", co-produced by German distribution company X Filme.
In 2013 work on the film had stopped and conversion of the script to a musical had started.
In "The Simpsons" episode "The Lastest Gun in the West", ca.
06 min.
36 sec into the episode, all three Freak Brothers can be seen in a clip from the 1970s detective show "McTrigger", where they are shot at, and Franklin killed, by the eponymous hero, McTrigger.
