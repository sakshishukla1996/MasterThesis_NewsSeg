========,2,Transportation.
========,3,Railroads.
Connellsville has the distinction of having been served at one time by five railroads: the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Western Maryland Railroad, the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, and the Norfolk and Western Railroad.
The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (now CSX Transportation) entered Connellsville on the right (east) side of the Youghiogheny River.
This main line originated in Cumberland, Maryland, and followed the river to Pittsburgh, then continuing on to Chicago.
The Pennsylvania Railroad's Southwest branch from Greensburg entered Connellsville from Connellsville Township, crossing Route 119 and the North End, then crossing the Youghiogheny on a trestle in the middle of the town; this line terminated in Uniontown, Pennsylvania.
The line has been abandoned, and the trestle was demolished in the late 1980s.
It remains as a coal loading facility behind the location of the former Back Creek Lumber Co where the line was severed.
This line is now operated by the Southwest Pennsylvania Railroad.
The Western Maryland Railroad's line crossed the Alleghenies from Cumberland and entered Connellsville on the right side of the Youghiogheny River, connecting with two separate railroad companies.
The first connection was with the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad's line from Pittsburgh which continued down the right side of the river to Pittsburgh.
This was in direct competition with the B & O directly across the river.
The second connection of the Western Maryland was to the Norfolk and Western Railroad which crossed the river to the left side on the former Pittsburgh & West Virginia railroad bridge.
The Norfolk & Western branch was acquired by the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad, which built a new connection on the left side of the river to CSX, which severed the old line across the bridge.
This historic bridge is now threatened with demolition.
Several of these former railway lines have been abandoned and the right of way acquired for other uses.
The former Western Maryland Railroad and Pittsburgh & Lake Erie lines are now the part of the Youghiogheny River Trail.
Amtrak's provides passenger rail service to Connellsville, with service to Chicago, Pittsburgh, Washington, DC, and other points in between.
