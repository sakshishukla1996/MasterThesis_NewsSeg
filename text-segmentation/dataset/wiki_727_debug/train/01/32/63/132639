========,2,History.
Rices Landing is a small rural town located along the western bank of the Monongahela River, approximately south of Pittsburgh.
One of the first visitors to the area was George Washington.
Tale has it that in 1775, while he was traveling to Fort Duquesne, he and his men camped in this area.
In 1786, John Rice purchased land on the east side of Enoch's Run, and at about the same time, Abijah McClain purchased land on the west side.
John Rice named the community he built "Rices Landing", while Abijah McClain called his settlement "Newport".
In 1801, Benjamin Franklin mapped out the area and combined the two communities under the name "Rices Landing".
Enoch's Run was renamed "Swan Run" before it eventually took the name it holds today, Pumpkin Run.
Rices Landing officially incorporated in April 1903.
The availability of valuable resources such as trees, clay, sand, coal and transportation allowed the community to thrive.
Shops, trading posts, taverns, and other businesses once lined its busy streets.
It was so prosperous that it was regarded as the "Gateway to Western Pennsylvania" by frontier settlers.
Although things have quieted today, the residents still see their community as a charming and respectable community that was once the talk of the frontier world.
Rices Landing is the former home of US Olympic wrestler and four-time state champion Cary Kolat.
He is known as being one of the best wrestlers in history, going 137-0 in high school and 111-7 in college.
