Elizabeth Township was established in 1757 as a split off Warwick Township.
It was split again in 1853 to create the present Clay Township to the east.
In early colonial days the area now comprising Elizabeth Township played an important part in the development of the County.
The village of Brickerville dates from 1741, when the area's first blast furnace was built to make cast iron from ore from the Cornwall mines.
Stiegel glass manufacturing, dating from 1757, soon grew into an international export.
Iron production grew, reaching its peak about 1780 and continuing until 1856.
The supplying of charcoal from area forests to feed the furnaces over this period became an important related industry.
