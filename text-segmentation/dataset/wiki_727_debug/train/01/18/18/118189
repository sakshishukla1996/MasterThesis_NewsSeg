========,1,preface.
Frenchtown Charter Township is a charter township of Monroe County in the southeastern corner of the U.S. state of Michigan.
The population was 20,428 at the 2010 census.
Frenchtown is the second most-populated township in Monroe County after Bedford Township.
The township has no incorporated cities or villages but numerous unincorporated areas; it  is bordered by the city of Monroe to the south, and the two jurisdictions are politically independent.
Sterling State Park and the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station are located within the township.
========,2,History.
This area was long occupied by Native Americans, including the historic Potawatomi.
The Frenchtown area was settled by Europeans along the banks of the River Raisin in as early as 1784 by French Canadians, whose descendants are known as Muskrat French.
Around the same time, the Sandy Creek Settlement was established near the main settlement of Frenchtown by Joseph Porlier Benec.
This area became part of the United States after the Treaty of Paris (1783), specifically and sequentially part of the Northwest Territory (1787), Indiana Territory (1803), Michigan Territory (1805), and, finally, the State of Michigan (1837).
During the War of 1812, the area was the site of the Battle of Frenchtown, in which 397 Americans were killed by the British Army and Native American coalition; this was the highest number of American fatalities of any battle during the war.
The battlefield site today is within the River Raisin National Battlefield Park, which was designated in 2009 and falls within the present-day city limits of Monroe.
That area of Frenchtown township was renamed and incorporated in 1817 as the village of Monroe in honor of then-President James Monroe's future visit to the Michigan Territory later that year.
In the same year, the city of Monroe was named as the county seat of the newly created Monroe County.
Monroe re-incorporated as a city in 1837.
When that happened, the remaining area known as Frenchtown was reorganized as a township, encompassing much of the northern portion of the county — the area from the River Raisin to the Huron River at Wayne County's southern border.
Shortly after, the northern portion of the township was broken off to form Ash Township and Berlin Charter Township by 1867.
In addition to that, pieces of the southern portion of Frenchtown have been annexed by the city of Monroe on many occasions.
Because of that, the boundary between the current Frenchtown Charter Township and the city limits of Monroe is jagged.

Small pieces of the township are also organized into the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge.
Frenchtown Charter Township is bordered on the south by the city of Monroe, but a small portion of the southern border touches Monroe Charter Township.
Raisinville Township is to the west, and Ash and Berlin Charter Townships border on the north.
A very small portion of the northwest corner of Frenchtown Charter Township touches Exeter Township.
The River Raisin serves as the boundary between Frenchtown and the city of Monroe for a short length near Lake Erie and then again further upstream for a small portion near the Custer Airport.
Sandy Creek also runs through Frenchtown before ending in Lake Erie.

A very small portion in the northwest corner near the terminus of M-125 at US 24 is within 48117.
