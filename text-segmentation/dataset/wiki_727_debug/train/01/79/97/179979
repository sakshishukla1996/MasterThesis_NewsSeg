========,1,preface.
The College of New Jersey, abbreviated TCNJ, is a public, coeducational university in the Trenton suburb of Ewing Township, New Jersey, United States.
TCNJ was established in 1855 by an act of the New Jersey Legislature.
The institution was the first normal school in the state of New Jersey and the fifth in the United States.
Originally located in Trenton proper, the college was moved to its present location in adjacent Ewing Township during the early to mid-1930s.
Since its inception, TCNJ has undergone several name changes, the most recent being the 1996 change to its current name from Trenton State College.
TCNJ is a highly selective institution, with a stated mission to keep New Jersey's most talented students in-state for higher education.
The college is recognized as one of the best public institutions in the United States, and is consistently ranked as the #1 public institution in New Jersey in its category; known for its programs in business, education, engineering, humanities, nursing and science.
TCNJ aims to combine the best practices of private institutions with a public mission, resulting in an innovative and unique model for undergraduate education.
The college encourages free inquiry and open exchange, offering a wide range of learning opportunities in its classrooms, laboratories, and studios, and throughout the campus, as well as at various off-campus locations.
The institution is organized into seven schools, all of which offer four-year bachelor's degree programs, and several of which offer targeted master's degree programs.
Emphasis is placed on liberal arts education via the college's general education requirements.
Much of TCNJ is built in Georgian colonial architecture style on 289 tree-lined acres.
========,2,History.
The College of New Jersey was established on February 9, 1855, by an act of the New Jersey Legislature mandating the creation of a state normal school, making the New Jersey State Normal School the first teacher training institution in New Jersey and the ninth in the United States.
Prior to this, then-Governor Rodman McCamley Price had actively promoted the notion of founding a training institute for New Jersey's teachers, and helped to mobilize support among influential state leaders:
For the first 73 years, the school was located in Trenton on Clinton Avenue.
Beginning in 1925, the institution offered its first four-year baccalaureate degrees, and engaged on a transitional program of expansion.
In 1928, a suburban tract of 210 acres (0.8 km²) was purchased in Ewing Township, New Jersey and preparations were underway to relocate the College.
The first building erected on the new campus was Green Hall, built in traditional Georgian colonial style.
The majority of buildings now on campus reflect Green Hall's architecture.
In 1996, in a move spearheaded by Harold Eickhoff, The College of New Jersey adopted its current name.
Programs in graduate study were instituted in 1947, followed by accreditation from various national associations in the 1950s.
The enactment of the "Higher Education Act of 1966" paved the way for TCNJ to become a comprehensive institution by expanding its degree programs into a variety of fields aside from the education of teachers.
By 1972, 70 percent of entering students were selecting non-education majors.

Each apartment has a living room/dining area, separate bedrooms, one or two bathrooms depending upon the unit, a full kitchen with a dishwasher and a full-sized washer and dryer.
The complex has 500 parking spots.
The Campus Town complex houses an 11,500-square-foot fitness center that replaced the college’s 4,000-square-foot gym.
The apartments and the fitness center are only open to the students, but the complex’s retail stores will be open to the public.

There are several different sections within this dining hall, providing students with a variety of food and beverage choices.
The late night dining hall is located between the Travers and Wolfe towers (freshman housing) and looks rather like a large diner.
Flatscreen TVs are mounted among the couches and tables to provide entertainment while students eat.
A café serving Starbucks coffee is located on the main level of the TCNJ library.

Breakfast foods and some lunch items are served here.
It is located in the center of Armstrong Hall, and among the tables and chairs various engineering and science exhibits can be viewed.
The Brower Student Center is home to three different dining facilities.
The "Fairgrounds" is located near one of the main entrances and is the smallest of the three.
Because there are various couches and benches of the students center surrounding it, it does not have seating of its own.
The Rathskellar or "Rat" is a restaurant and bar, where students can sit down to order meals from servers, including the famous "Kesselburger" (chili-cheese burger).
Alcoholic beverages are served, and IDs are always checked.

A game room is also located in the student center, complete with multiple pool tables, TVs with wiis connected, ping pong and other games.
The building is home to all of the student organizations on campus, as well as the dining facilities that are run by Sodexo Incorporated and a campus bookstore.
All recognized student organizations have an office or cubicle, or at least a meeting area.
Most of these are located on the second level, but there are a handful located elsewhere.
The student-run newspaper, for example, has both its business office and production room in the basement.
The building was named after former president Clayton R. Brower, who served as president during the time that TCNJ was referred to as Trenton State College.
His wife, Dorothy Brower, was an active volunteer in the surrounding community.
Renovations for the new Brower Student Center began in April 2015 and are expected to be finished in 2017.

The Seal is TCNJ's yearbook, which has been in publication since 1911.
Both The Signal and The Seal are run almost entirely out of offices located in the Brower Student Center basement.
TCNJ Magazine is another publication, covering both current campus life and alumni affairs.
The Perspective, an openly left-leaning student news booklet, is the school's newest publication having been first published in 2009.
The Perspective received funding from the Student Finance Board, but so far has no established publishing schedule (as opposed to other campus publications).

========,3,Athletics.
The College of New Jersey is affiliated with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and participates in athletics events as a Division III school.
It is a member of the New Jersey Athletic Conference (NJAC) and the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC).
The mascot is "Roscoe the Lion".
TCNJ's varsity teams are the top combined first- and second-place finishers of all 424 Division III schools in the nation over more than 25 years.
The main athletic facility, Lions Stadium, holds 6,000 spectators and is home to the football, field hockey, lacrosse, and intramural teams.
The stadium opened in the fall of 1984 and featured the first North American installation of AstroTurf's vertical-drainage system.
This system prevents the "duck-pond effect" commonly seen with other artificial surfaces.
In 2008, reports indicated that the turf contained higher-than-acceptable levels of lead and was subsequently removed.
Now, the stadium is furnished with Tiger Turf, which is the first installation of the Trophy Turf in the United States.
The stadium has hosted multiple NCAA tournaments and championship games, as well as the annual Special Olympics New Jersey and the annual USSBA Central Jersey Regional marching band competition.
The women's lacrosse team has played in the championship game 16 out of 20 possible times, winning 11 (though the 1992 title was later vacated) and qualifying for the NCAA tournament 21 consecutive times through 2005, highlighted by a 93–1 record from 1991 to 1996.
The women's field hockey team has won 10 Division III crowns in 14 championship appearances (both twice as many as any other school).
The TCNJ wrestling team hosts the NCAA championships regularly and has placed in the top 20 nationally for 30 consecutive years, including 5 national championships (1979, 1981, 1984, 1985, 1987), 5 runner-up finishes, and numerous finishes in the top 5.
The TCNJ track and field teams have also dominated the New Jersey Athletic Conference.
Since the NJAC title was first contested in 1997, TCNJ has won the title — both indoor and outdoor — each year.
