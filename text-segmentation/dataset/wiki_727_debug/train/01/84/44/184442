========,1,preface.
Chicoutimi is the most populous borough (arrondissement) of the city of Saguenay in Quebec, Canada.
It is situated at the confluence of the Saguenay and Chicoutimi rivers.
During the 20th century, it became the main administrative and commercial centre of the Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean region.
In 2002 it merged into the new city of Saguenay and forms the heart of the 5th-largest urban area of the province of Quebec.
At the 2011 census, its population was 66,547.
========,2,History.
What was ultimately to become the centre of the borough of Chicoutimi was first settled by French colonists in 1676 as a trading post in the fur trade.
At that time, the Saguenay and the Chicoutimi rivers had been used as waterways by the Montagnais tribes for centuries.
The name "Chicoutimi" means "the end of the deep water" in the Innu language.
After the British seized Lower Canada, the Chicoutimi trading post continued to operate only until 1782, as the fur trade had moved further west of the Great Lakes.
The city of Chicoutimi was officially incorporated in 1845 as a municipality by Peter McLeod, a Métis timber contractor who built a sawmill there in 1842.
The town was designated in 1855 as the seat of Chicoutimi County and the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Chicoutimi in 1878.
The arrival of the Canadian National Railway in 1893 stimulated the growth of Chicoutimi's pulp and paper industries, particularly mechanical pulp production.
The "Chicoutimi Pulp Co." was founded in 1896 backed by French-Canadian investors.
The Chicoutimi Pulp Mill became the biggest producer of mechanical pulp in Canada by 1910.
Since the Great Depression, the city has become an administrative and commercial centre.
New centers of education and culture were established: in 1967, the Conservatoire de musique de Saguenay; and in 1969, the Université du Québec à Chicoutimi.
The city also played host to the Quebec Summer Games in 1972.
In the municipal amalgamations of 1976, Chicoutimi annexed the neighbouring towns of Chicoutimi-Nord and Rivière-du-Moulin.
In a much larger round of Municipal reorganization in Quebec in 2002, the cities of Chicoutimi, Jonquière, La Baie, Lac-Kénogami, Laterrière, Shipshaw and part of Tremblay merged to form the new city of Saguenay.
Chicoutimi became a borough of Saguenay.
During the summer of 1996, a record rainfall in the region caused major flooding in the downtown, as well as outlying areas.
Dams were overrun, many bridges were destroyed throughout the region.
The total cost of the disaster was recorded as 1.5 billion Canadian dollars.
The flood also claimed seven lives.
Chicoutimi's sister city is Camrose, Alberta.
========,2,Geography and cityscape.
Chicoutimi is located in Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean region on the western end of the Saguenay Fjord; most of the borough, including the downtown section, is on the south shore of the Saguenay River.
It is the geographical centre of the city of Saguenay; the Jonquière and La Baie boroughs adjoin on the west and east sides.
Chicoutimi is about north of Quebec City and northwest upriver from Tadoussac, at the confluence of the St. Lawrence River.
