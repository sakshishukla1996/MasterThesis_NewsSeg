========,1,preface.
The Vicar of Bray is a satirical description of an individual fundamentally changing his principles to remain in ecclesiastical office as external requirements change around him.
The religious upheavals in England from 1533 to 1559 (and then from 1633 to 1715) made it impossible for any devout clergyman to comply with all the successive requirements of the established church.
The original figure was the vicar Simon Aleyn, although clerics who faced vicissitudes resulted in revised versions of the story.
A satirical 18th-century song, "The Vicar of Bray", recounts the career of a vicar of Bray, Berkshire, towards the end of this period and his contortions of principle in order to retain his ecclesiastic office despite the changes through the course of several monarchs from Charles II to George I.
A comic opera covers a later period in 18th-century history, while a film set in Bray, County Wicklow, in Ireland, covers Charles I, the English Civil War, the Commonwealth of England, The Protectorate, and restoration of Charles II.
========,2,Historical basis.
The figure described was Simon Aleyn between 1540 and 1588; he preached the Bible and oversaw the baptism, confirmation, marriage and burial of his hundreds of parishioners in the reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary, and Elizabeth as the church minister of the almost wholly agriculturally cultivated parish, today much reduced, of Bray.
The main work of Thomas Fuller (d.1661), "Worthies of England", describes this man:
Clerics who took a similar attitude to that of the 16th-century Vicar of Bray gave occasion for revised versions of the poems and songs.
A variety of other clerics inspired the various re-writes depending on their location and date:

========,2,Description of the song and lyrics.
In the song "The Vicar of Bray", the eponymous vicar was the clergyman of St Michael's Church, Bray.
The most familiar version of the lyrics recount his adaptability (some would say amorality) over half a century, from the reigns of Charles II to George I.
Over this period, he embraced whichever form of liturgy, Protestant or Catholic, was favoured by the monarch of the day in order to retain his position as vicar of Bray.
The following lyric is a version of the song recorded by Richard Dyer-Bennet in 1955:
========,2,Comic opera.
"The Vicar of Bray" is an 1882 comic opera by Sydney Grundy and Edward Solomon.
The opera is based on the character described in the 18th-century song, as well as on "The History of Sandford and Merton", a series of 18th century moral tales.
========,2,1937 film version.
A film version of the tale was released in 1937 starring Stanley Holloway as the vicar.
In the film, the vicar (of Bray, County Wicklow, in Ireland) is given a more positive character and events are placed at a slightly earlier period, during the English Civil War.
He successfully protects his parishioners by adopting a diplomatic approach during the turbulent events and secures forgiveness for moderate rebels from the restored Charles II.
========,2,Cultural impact.
The Tower of Bray is also referred to in the song "Parlour Songs" in the Stephen Sondheim musical "Sweeney Todd", although the song has been removed from more recent performances of that musical.
George Orwell wrote an essay called "A Good Word for the Vicar of Bray.
