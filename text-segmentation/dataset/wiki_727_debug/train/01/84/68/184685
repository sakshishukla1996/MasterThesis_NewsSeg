========,1,preface.
Jesus Freak is the fourth studio album by the band DC Talk and was released on November 21, 1995 on ForeFront Records.
The style was a marked departure from the group's previous releases, incorporating a heavier rock sound and elements of grunge that was popular at the time.
The album was released to both critical and commercial acclaim.
It peaked at number 16 on the "Billboard" 200 and six of the album's seven singles reached number one across various Christian radio formats.
It won the 1997 Grammy Award for Best Rock Gospel Album.
"Jesus Freak" is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most influential albums in the history of Christian music.
========,2,Background.
After three albums of hip-hop oriented sound, including DC Talk's Grammy award-winning third album, "Free at Last", which was based primarily on hip-hop- and pop-oriented songwriting, the trio decided to innovate and reinvent their style.
After three years, DC Talk returned with songs featuring a more alternative rock sound.
Thus, the album's lead single, "Jesus Freak", was considered unexpected by fans and critics alike.
Michael Tait said, "I was totally into rock and roll at the time [...] I really wanted to make a rock record."
The band decided to focus on more rock-oriented music, with touches of rap and pop interwoven into the mix.
Tait later explained, "We wanted to write songs that would hopefully touch a generation."
========,2,Recording and production.
Compared to DC Talk's other albums, "Jesus Freak" was, stylistically, an experiment.
The album was a fusion of various musical genres, including pop, rock, and grunge, all combined with hip hop.
The title track, "Jesus Freak," is also of historical importance.
It is believed to be the first link between grunge and rapcore in CCM.
The song was even played on some secular stations.
In addition, the album contains two cover songs: "Day by Day," from the musical "Godspell", and a heavily overhauled version of "In the Light" originally by Charlie Peacock.
Two spoken-word samples are also heard; "Mind's Eye" features the words of Billy Graham and "What If I Stumble" contains a quote from Brennan Manning.
========,2,Release.
"Jesus Freak" was released on November 21, 1995.
It debuted at number 16 on the "Billboard" 200, selling over 85,800 copies in its first week of release.
This number was the highest debut for a Christian album at the time.
After the album, released through ForeFront Records, proved to be extremely successful, the band signed an exclusive distribution deal with Virgin Records.
The label made it a priority to promote the album to mainstream music fans.
Due to this promotional increase, "Between You and Me" became a hit for the band, managing to chart on the "Billboard" Hot 100.
