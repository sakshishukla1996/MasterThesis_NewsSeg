========,2,History.
Organization of Willmont Township (note the double-L) was approved by the Nobles County Board on November 12, 1878.
There was a general disagreement over the township name, one faction wishing to call it Willumet, and the other favoring Lamont.
On November 22, 1878, a compromise was reached, and the township was formally named Willmont.
When the town of Wilmont was established in 1899, one L was dropped to distinguish it from Willmont Township.
Somewhere along the line, the township name was also changed to Wilmont (single-L).
The reason for this change remains obscure.
