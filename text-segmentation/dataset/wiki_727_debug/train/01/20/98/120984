The town of Lismore was named after Lismore Township which, in turn, was named after a village in County Waterford, Ireland, noted for its beautiful castle.
The name for Lismore Township was suggested by Father C. J. Knauf of Adrian.
Lismore owes its existence to the building of the Burlington Railroad through northeast Nobles County.
The railroad established the towns of Reading and Wilmont in 1899.
When the railroad reached present-day Lismore at 3:00 pm on Saturday, June 9, 1900, construction of the town immediately commenced.
The first business on site was the St. Croix Lumber company which sold its wares from a tent pitched next to a large pile of lumber hauled in from Wilmont.
The first building in town was built by James Beacom and was used as a saloon.

B. Bratager store building.
James Montgomery started a small grain elevator, and James Ramage opened a lumber yard and hardware store under the management of Arch Priest.

A livery stable, a butcher shop, a restaurant, and a blacksmith shop were also opened in that first year.
A school house, churches, several businesses, and many residences were constructed in 1901.
On December 6, 1901, the Lismore Leader was able to boast:
"Lismore, for a place only a little over one year old, has made good and substantial growth... Lismore has one bank, two general merchants, one furniture store, two saloons, two pool rooms, two lumber yards, three elevators, four coal dealers, one hotel, one hardware store, two machinery firms, one blacksmith shop, one livery stable, one dray line, and one newspaper."
