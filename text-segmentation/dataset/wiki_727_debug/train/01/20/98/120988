========,2,History.
Organization of Olney Township was approved by the Nobles County Board on July 10, 1873.
The original name selected was Hebbard Township in honor of pioneer settler William F Hebbard.
However, no township meeting was called until October 14, 1873, and shortly before this meeting occurred, the Nobles County Board changed the name to New Haven Township.
Shortly thereafter, the county was informed by the state auditor's office that another New Haven Township existed elsewhere in the state.
Finally, on June 15, 1874, the board accepted the suggestion of pioneer settler R. W. Moberly that the township be named after Olney, Illinois, county seat of Richland County, Illinois.
