========,2,History.
Organization of Ransom Township was approved by the Nobles County Board on September 3, 1872.
It was originally called Grant Township after former General, and then presidential candidate, Ulysses S. Grant.
Many of the pioneer settlers were Union Army veterans and this name had wide support.
However, the county board was informed by the state auditor's office that another Grant Township existed in Washington County, Minnesota.
Thus, on July 10, 1873, the name was officially changed to Ransom Township in honor of Ransom Humiston, agent for the National Colony, which brought large groups of settlers to Worthington from 1872 until 1876.
Township residents were not consulted on the name change.
Grant Township in Washington County was broken up and absorbed among neighboring townships in 1919.
However, the small town of Grant, Minnesota, still exists in the same vicinity.
