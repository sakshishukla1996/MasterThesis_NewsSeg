========,2,History.
Fitzgerald was developed in 1895 by Philander H. Fitzgerald, an Indianapolis newspaper editor and a former drummer boy in the Union Army, who founded it as a community for Civil War veterans – both from the Union and from the Confederacy.
The majority of the first citizens (some 2700) were Union veterans.
It was incorporated on December 2, 1896.
The town is located less than from the site of the capture of Confederate president Jefferson Davis on May 10, 1865.
Fitzgerald is one of the few truly planned cities in the United States.
The city was laid out as a square, with intersecting streets dividing it into four wards.
Each of the wards was divided into four blocks and each block had sixteen squares.
Streets running North/South on the east side of the city were named after Confederate ships and generals, whereas the ones on the west side were named after Union ships and generals.
After about a year, the citizens planned a Thanksgiving harvest parade.
Separate Union and Confederate parades were planned.
However, when the band struck up to play, the Confederates joined the Union veterans to march as one beneath the US flag.
In recent years, the unofficial, and sometimes controversial, mascot of the city has become the red junglefowl, a wild chicken native to the Indian subcontinent.
In the late 1960s, a small number were released into the woods surrounding the city and have thrived to this day.
