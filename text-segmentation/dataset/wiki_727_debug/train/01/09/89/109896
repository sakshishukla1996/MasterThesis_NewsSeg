========,2,History.
The community was originally known as McDonald, named after one of two prominent families in the area.
However, concerns were raised about misdirected mail, resulting from confusion between McDonald, in the southern part of the state, and McDonough located in the north.
Postmaster D. D. Peacock suggested that the community should be renamed to alleviate the postal confusion.
Mr. Peacock graciously suggested the name of Pavo.
The short and somewhat poetic name was quickly accepted by the townfolk.
After a vote the name change was made official.
It was only later that they learned that Pavo is Latin for "peacock".
A street in the town of Pavo is named after the McDonalds.
The city celebrates "Peacock Day" on the second Saturday each May.
