========,1,preface.
Richmond Hill is a city in Bryan County, Georgia, United States.
James Oglethorpe, only a year after the founding of the Georgia colony at Savannah, awarded grants of land on the Ogeechee River in 1734.
Once known as St. Phillips Parish, Bryan County was established in 1793.
On February 1, 1797 the Bryan County justices valued at the Cross Roads for $24 for the purpose of establishing a permanent county seat in courthouse.
Cross Roads was the intersection of the Savannah-Darien Stage Road (current US 17) and the Bryan Neck Road (current GA Hwy 144).
The Cross Roads became Ways Station in 1856 when the Savannah, Albany & Gulf R.R.
was built across the nearby Ogeechee River into Bryan County.
Near this site a train depot was built, which came to be known as "Ways No.
1 ½" for William J.
Way, the first station master and a local rice planter on lands through which the railroad passed.
A settlement grew up in the section between the railroad tracks and the Crossroads just to the west.
It came to be called Ways Station, a designation that lasted until 1941 when the name of the community was changed to Richmond Hill.
The population was 9,281, up from 6,959 at the 2000 census.
It is part of the Savannah Metropolitan Statistical Area.
========,2,Geography.
Richmond Hill is located along the eastern border of Bryan County at (31.938151, -81.313750).
The Ogeechee River forms the eastern edge of the city (and the county line); an outlying portion of the city of Savannah is on the opposite side of the river.
U.S. Route 17 (Ocean Highway) passes through the city north of the original downtown.
Interstate 95 passes through the western edge of the city, with access from Exit 87 (US 17) and Exit 90 (Georgia State Route 144/Ford Avenue).
Downtown Savannah is to the north, and Brunswick is to the south.
According to the United States Census Bureau, Richmond Hill has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.42%, is water.
The city limits of Richmond Hill have expanded to the east along S.R.
144, where there are a number of planned developments.
This area contains large amounts of marsh and riverfront property.
Farther to the east are Fort McAllister Historic Park and the small community of Keller.
Residents of the entire South Bryan County area rely on Richmond Hill proper for basic services, and must travel through the city to leave the county, especially when commuting to Savannah via U.S. 17 or I-95.
Most South Bryan residents, especially the large percentage of relative newcomers, would likely say they were "from Richmond Hill."
========,2,History.
Richmond Hill has a historical connection to industrialist Henry Ford.
Ford used the town, formerly known as Ways Station, as a winter home and philanthropic social experiment, building the complex known as the Ford Farms along the Ogeechee River in the 1930s.
After just one visit he chose this area as his winter home.
Ford's dwelling was built on the site of Richmond Plantation, which was burned by elements of General William T. Sherman's army at the conclusion of the "March to the Sea".
Ford's holdings eventually totaled of agricultural and timber lands, most of which is now owned by the State of Georgia or ITT Rayonier, a timber company.
Ford was also responsible for the construction of a number of public buildings, including a kindergarten, which now houses the museum of the Richmond Hill Historical Society, and a chapel which now houses St. Anne's Catholic Church.
Both are located on Georgia S.R.
144, also known as Ford Avenue within the Richmond Hill city limits.
The Ford Plantation has now been redeveloped as a luxury resort, with vacation cottages, a clubhouse, tennis, and golf.
When it was suggested that the town be renamed "Ford", Mr. Ford declined, and instead Ways Station was renamed "Richmond Hill" after the site of Ford's home on the banks of the Ogeechee River.
Richmond Hill was incorporated as a city in 1962.
The current mayor is Harold Fowler, who took office in 2009.
Previously, Richard Davis served in that capacity since 1989.
The city is governed by a mayor and a four-member city council.
Richmond Hill was the location of the discovery in 2004 of Benjaman Kyle, a man who suffers from retrograde amnesia as a result of a severe beating.
In 2015, he was identified as William Burgess Powell.
========,3,Development.
Real estate development in Richmond Hill has generally followed trends represented in the United States as a whole.
Post-Civil War populations remained relatively stable until the arrival of industrialist Henry Ford in the 1930s.
In the early 1970s, subdivisions began to spring up, and the "white flight" from nearby Savannah began a settlement trend that has continued steadily until the present.
Subdivisions of varying quality, ranging from starter homes to exclusive, gated golf communities, have emerged.
