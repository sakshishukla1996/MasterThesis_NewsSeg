========,2,History.
San Antonio was founded "(in name only)" in 1881 by Edmund F. Dunne who previously had been chief justice of the Arizona territory.
Dunne was a legal counsel involved in the Disston Land Purchase, and as his commission, received 100,000 choice acres (400 km2) of land out of the 4,000,000 acre (16,000 km²) purchase.
The following year on February 15, while surveying the Disston Purchase with his cousin, Captain Hugh Dunne, Judge Dunne selected the city's location and began settling it.
He established the city as the center of a Catholic colony in Florida.
Dunne planned several other villages for the surrounding area including Saint Joseph, Saint Thomas, Villa Maria, Carmel and San Felipe, but only the rural community of Saint Joseph survives today.
In 1889 the Benedictines established the monastery of St. Leo and St. Leo College on Dunne's former homestead and farm land, later incorporating the area as part of a separate town, St. Leo, Florida.
At about the same time, five Benedictine sisters established Holy Name Convent in the center of San Antonio.
The nuns had come to teach at two local schools (St. Anthony School and St. Joseph School), as well as to establish Holy Name Academy.
The sisters had the convent and the academy physically moved by oxen to a 40-acre parcel in St. Leo overlooking the southwestern shore of Lake Jovita in 1911.
The nuns remained at St. Anthony School until the end of the 2009-10 academic year.
At the time of its founding San Antonio was located in the southern third of Hernando County, as Pasco County was not created until 1887.
The Orange Belt Railway first began service to San Antonio in November 1887.
For a short time in the 1920s San Antonio officially changed its name to the town of Lake Jovita, only to revert before the end of the decade.
