========,2,History.
Since the 1920s, the Detroit-based Miami Beach Heights Corporation – headed by industrialists Robert C. Graham, Walter O. Briggs, and Carl G. Fisher – owned of undeveloped, partially swampy land that stretched from the bay to the Atlantic.
Mr. Graham assumed the duties as the developer for Bal Harbour.
In the 1930s, city planners Harland Bartholomew & Associates were called in to design the Village.
The company made several plans and they were submitted to the Miami Beach Heights for review.
The original name chosen for Bal Harbour was Bay Harbour.
However, the planning committee didn't think that was appropriate for a city that was on the beach.
A name was invented to encompass a village that ran from the bay to the Atlantic Ocean.
The "b" was taken from the word bay and the "a" and "l" were taken from the name Atlantic.
Hence the word "Bal" was created.
In 1940, World War II began and the plans were put on hold.
As a goodwill gesture to the government, Robert C. Graham rented the land to the United States Air Corps for $1 per year.
The Air Corps used this land to train their soldiers and established a Prisoner of War camp.
The ocean front area was used as a rifle range and the barracks were set up on the west side of Collins Avenue.
The camp for prisoners was located where the Bal Harbour Shops are presently.
In 1945, the war was over in both Germany and Japan.
The Air Corps left the barracks buildings as a thank you to the owners of the property.
These barracks were converted into apartment homes by Mr. Graham in 1946.
In order to incorporate a city in 1946, there had to be at least 25 male registered voters residing in the area.
Mr. Graham had twenty five families move into the apartment homes that he had converted in order to qualify the Village for incorporation.
He then hired Willard Webb, a Miami Beach tax assessor, to draft a charter for the Village.
After the charter was completed, the Village of Bal Harbour was incorporated on August 14, 1946, by Mr. Graham and 25 male registered voters.
The Village was operated under the city manager form of government.
The Council established a volunteer fire department.
Swampland was filled, sea walls were constructed and the yacht basin was created.
Contracts were signed for the sewer systems, water pumping stations and utilities.
Bal Harbour was the first planned community in Florida to have its utilities placed underground.

Collins Avenue was paved into four lanes with a landscaped median and later widened to the present day six lanes.
Village plans indicated that ocean front property was to be deep and lots approached $100,000.
