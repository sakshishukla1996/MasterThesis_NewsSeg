========,2,History.
Brownsville was originally a settlement for white families in the 1920s.
blacks began moving into the neighborhood between the late 1940s and early 1960s as the population surrounding nearby Liberty Square expanded and many inner-city shites moved to newly built suburban subdivisions surrounding Miami city proper in the wake of World War II.
By the mid-1960s, Brownsville was a thriving community for black professionals.
However, the wake of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 that outlawed the restrictive covenants and riots in 1968 and 1980 brought the black flight of middle- and upper-class families from the community.
Brownsville experienced continued population loss from 1970 until 2000, as part of a greater suburbanization trend of among the U.S. upwardly-mobile middle class.
By the 2010 US Census, Brownsville had gained population for the first time in over 40 years, rising to 15,313 residents.
