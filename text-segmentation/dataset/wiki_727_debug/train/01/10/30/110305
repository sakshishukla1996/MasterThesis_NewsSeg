in the U.S. state of Georgia.

========,2,History.
The area now known as Waycross was first settled "circa" 1820, locally known as "Old Nine" or "Number Nine" and then Pendleton.
It was renamed Tebeauville in 1857, incorporated under that name in 1866, and designated county seat of Ware County in 1873.
It was incorporated as "Way Cross" on March 3, 1874.
Waycross gets its name from the city’s location at key railroad junctions; lines from six directions meet at the city.
Waycross was the site of the 1948 Waycross B-29 crash, which led to the legal case "United States v. Reynolds" (1953), expanding the government's state secrets privilege.
During the 1950s the city had a tourist gimmick: local police would stop motorists with out-of-state license plates and escort them to downtown Waycross.
There they would be met by the Welcome World Committee and given overnight lodging, dinner and a trip to the Okefenokee Swamp.
The tradition faded away after the interstates opened through Georgia.
During the mid-1990s, Waycross originated a frozen hamburger that needed no defrosting, the Bubba Burger.
This was the creation of Eaves Foods, Inc., a company that later changed to Bubba Foods, LLC.
in 2000.
Bubba Burgers are now sold nationwide as well as worldwide through the United States Military Commissary system.

In May 2010, the city purchased the Bandalong Litter Trap and installed it in Tebeau Creek, a tributary of the Satilla River.
The trap was invented in Australia, but is manufactured in the United States.
Although the city has maintained a good standing with the state's Environmental Protection Division, the city wanted to take action to reduce the amount of human generated trash entering the Satilla River and ultimately the Atlantic Ocean.
Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue said, “Water is one of Georgia’s most important and precious resources... the litter trap installed by Waycross is a model of stewardship for the state and the nation.” The Satilla River litter trap is the first in Georgia and only the second in the nation.
Part of Waycross was situated in Pierce County, but effective July 1, 2015, Waycross was no longer located nor allowed to be located in Pierce County.
State Rep. Chad Nimmer introduced HB 523 during the 2015 Legislative Session without providing the required statutory notice to the City of Waycross.
HB 523 de-annexed the portion of Waycross located in Pierce County and prevents the City of Waycross from coming back into Pierce County.
