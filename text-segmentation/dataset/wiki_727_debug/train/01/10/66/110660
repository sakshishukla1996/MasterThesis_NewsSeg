Grace is a city in Caribou County, Idaho, in the United States.

========,2,History.
The area of Grace was once inhabited by the Shoshone Indians.
White settlement dates back to the mid-to-late 19th century.
The Oregon Trail passed within of Grace.
Unlike other nearby historic towns such as Paris and Franklin, Grace was not originally settled by Mormon pioneers, but has since become a predominantly Mormon-populated town.
The economy in and around Grace has traditionally been driven by agriculture, with potatoes, alfalfa, grain, dairy and ranching being the main staples.
========,2,Geography.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.
Grace is one of the northernmost cities along the Wasatch Range which extends approximately south, and is only west of the large fault line that defines the range.
Grace is located near the center of Gem Valley.
In stark contrast to the surrounding mountains, the valley floor in the immediate area of Grace is flat due to volcanic activity in the area some 30,000 years ago.
The lava flow that created the valley also diverted the Bear River from its Pacific drainage into the Great Basin.
This was a significant contributor to the growth of the prehistoric Lake Bonneville of which the Great Salt Lake is a remnant.
Lake Bonneville reached its farthest north advance about four miles (6 km) southwest of Grace before it broke through the earthen barrier at Red Rock pass north of Preston, Idaho.
The Bear River today runs to the north and west of Grace and terminates in the Great Salt Lake.
Grace's neighboring towns are Soda Springs to the north east, Bancroft to the north west, and Preston to the south.
It is about from Lava Hot Springs, which is a local tourism and recreation destination.
The nearest city with a major airport is Salt Lake City, Utah, which is approximately south.
========,3,Climate.
This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winter.
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Grace has a humid continental climate, abbreviated "Dfb" on climate maps.
========,2,Geology.
There are several extinct volcanoes and lava domes within miles of Grace, which contributes to the dark, nitrogen rich volcanic soil of the area.
This soil type is ideal for farming, particularly potatoes and grain.
Solid basalt can be found beneath the soil throughout most of the valley and exposed outcrops are common.
Other types of rock that are common in the area are limestone and shale.
These non-volcanic rock beds are rich with fossils of prehistoric marine life once native to the inland sea that covered the area some 280 million years ago, ranging from well preserved molluscan shells, to small fish.
Trilobite fossils can often be found in local shale deposits.
The inland sea was also responsible for the vast phosphate deposits that lie north of Grace and are a vital part of the area's economy.
The Bear River runs through Black Canyon which originates northwest of town and extends approximately south.
Approximately one-half mile downstream from the point of origin, the Black Canyon forms a sharp gorge with steep walls of black basalt cliffs.
At this point the gorge is only about wide and nearly deep.
The Wasatch Fault is visible from Grace due to the sharp displacement that creates a small bench at the foot of the mountains.
Mild to moderate earthquakes have been reported to originate at the fault.
