========,2,Albert Einstein and Cutchogue.
An avid sailor, Albert Einstein once called Little Peconic Bay in Cutchogue "the most beautiful sailing ground I ever experienced."
In the summers of 1938 and 1939 he rented a cottage on Old Cove Road, now called West Cove Road, on Nassau Point, and spent many hours alone in a little sailboat he called Tineff (Yiddish for "worthless").
Albert Einstein was taught to sail on Little Peconic Bay by two local brothers, Jack and Bob Fisher, who had a lot of patience getting him to become a successful yachtsman.
While in Cutchogue on August 2, 1939, pipe-smoking Einstein was visited by fellow Jewish physicists from Hungary Leó Szilárd (who had produced a nuclear chain reaction in a laboratory at Columbia University) and Edward Teller (both prompted by Niels Bohr), and dictated the famous Letter to President Roosevelt, alerting him to the new developments in nuclear physics and hinting that the Germans might be working on an atomic bomb, urging him to launch his own program.
The letter is widely credited with setting in motion the Manhattan Project, the US government effort that built the first atomic bomb.
When Szilárd first explained the concept of a nuclear chain reaction to him, Einstein gave the famous reply, "Daran habe ich gar nicht gedacht!"
("I really never thought of that before").
