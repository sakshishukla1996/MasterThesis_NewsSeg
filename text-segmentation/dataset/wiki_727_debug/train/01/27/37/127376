It was at Shoreham where an approved Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant was later disapproved as the result of public protest.
The builder, Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO), was partially reimbursed for money spent on construction.
The municipal bonds that were floated to reimburse the builder are being paid off by a special levy on the electric bills of residents of Long Island.
This was the last attempt to construct a nuclear power plant in the US.
Shoreham was served by the Shoreham LIRR station from 1900–1910.
It was located near the intersection of North Country Road and Randall Road.
