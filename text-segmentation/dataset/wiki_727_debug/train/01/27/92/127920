========,2,Stem High School vs UNC - Chapel Hill, 1936.
Long-time residents of Granville County recall the tale of how the Stem High School basketball team played and defeated the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill men's team in an impromptu basketball game.
As the story goes, the Stem team won the Granville County championship in 1936 and were rewarded by their coach (known only as Coach Pegram) with a trip to see UNC play Davidson at the Tin Can.
The Davidson team was unable to show because of a snowstorm, so Coach Pegram volunteered his team so that the crowd could still watch a game.
The team from Stem (Brent Meadows, Wallace Bowling, Thomas Farabow, Clyde Cates, and James "Bunk" Guthrie) played well against their college opponents, and in the end won the game on a dramatic last-second shot.
The story is unverified in contemporaneous sources.
If the game occurred, it is most likely to have taken place on February 12, 1936, when an influenza outbreak caused the cancellation of a UNC/Davidson basketball game.
"Bunk" Guthrie would have been 22 years old at the time and 4 years past his graduation (though the Stem team was disqualified from the 1934 county championship for using ineligible players, so this does not necessarily rule out his participation in 1936).
The Daily Tar Heel from February 13, 1936 mentions only that the team practiced on the date of the cancelled Davidson game to prepare for their upcoming contest against North Carolina State.
The story (true or not) has become a piece of local legend and brought statewide attention to the town of Stem in 1999 when it was covered by Frank Newell for the Warren Record of Warren County, and again in 2000 when it was covered by Ned Barnett on the front page of the News & Observer.
