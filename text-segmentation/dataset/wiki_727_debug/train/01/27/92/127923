========,2,History.
In its early history, Snow Hill was near the location of the final major battle of the Tuscarora War at Fort Neoheroka in 1713.
There are several theories for the derivation of the town's name.
One theory is that the town derived its name from the Contentnea Creek on whose banks Native Americans camped and called them "snowy white," which was translated into "snowy hills."
It snows rarely, however, so the snowy white is more likely a reference to the white sands along the creek.
Another theory was described by McLoud in the Goldsboro newspaper as being "loblolly pine is in water," and the most recent translation from the Tuscarora language offered was "as fish go by."
Originally a community in central Greene County, the town of Snow Hill was chartered in 1828.
The town almost became the capital of North Carolina and was originally a major trading depot on Contentnea Creek.
At the time, Contentnea Creek was a main Wilson to New Bern trading artery.
Contentnea Creek connects with the Neuse River at Kinston.
It is believed Snow Hill is the smallest town in the United States to ever field a professional baseball team.
From 1937-40, the Snow Hill Billies played in the Class D Coastal Plain League and won the league pennant in 1937.
