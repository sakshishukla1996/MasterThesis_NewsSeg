Deepwater is a coastal national park in Queensland, Australia, 375 km north of Brisbane.
It protects an area of sand dunes and coastal heaths in the Deepwater Creek catchment.
The area is one of the few remaining pristine freshwater catchments on Queensland's east coast.
Deepwater National Park was established in 1988 and covers 4,090 ha.
The north of the park is dominated by a 70 m high sand dune which is covered in vegetation.
There are some scattered rocky outcrops of volcanic origin including a number of rocky headlands along the park's 9 km of beach frontage.
========,2,Flora and fauna.
Vegetation in the park is varied between the seaward and landward side of the high dune.
To the east are typical beach plants, on the exposed higher areas the plants appear wind-sheared and to the west in more protected area taller vegetation has formed up to three canopy levels of forest and woodlands.
Beaches in the park are used for nesting by loggerhead and leatherback turtles.
Flatback and green turtles also nest on the park's beaches.
This location is the only mainland site where leatherbacks repeatedly return to lay eggs.
Rose-crowned fruit doves, fairy gerygones and grey fantails are commonly found in the canopies to the west.
Along the beaches pied oystercatcher, bar-tailed godwits, tattlers and crested terns are often seen.
