Kondalilla is a national park in the Blackall Range of South East Queensland, Australia, 91Â km north of Brisbane.
William Skene founded this area on his property while searching for lost cattle.
He named it Bon Accord before giving it to the Queensland Government who, during the fifties, renamed it Kondalilla which is an Aboriginal word for running water.
The area was first officially protected in 1906 as a recreational area, becoming a national park in 1945.
Access is easiest by road from Flaxton, east of the park.
There is a large picnic area where there are toilet facilities (non potable water).
There are two tracks which lead to the upper falls swimming hole.
A longer circuit track will take you to the bottom pool which is not suitable for swimming.
