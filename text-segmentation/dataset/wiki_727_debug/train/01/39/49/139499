========,2,History.
The Town of Center began as the Town of Lansing, organized on September 12, 1849.
It included the modern day areas of the towns of Freedom and Center, and "territory lying to the north that was sparsely settled".
The town of Freedom was established as a new town split off from the town of Lansing on June 5, 1852.
When the split occurred, Freedom took with it the officers of the town of Lansing, as well as the town seat, and many of its residents and public improvements.
A meeting was held on July 5, 1852 to fill the vacancies for the officers of the existing town of Lansing, although in practice this was the reorganization of a new town also called Lansing since there were no officers to provide continuity.
The legality of the action was apparently questioned.
An April 30, 1853 resolution of the board of supervisors of the town declared that the state of Wisconsin had granted legality to "acts of the town officers of last year", and also had granted the request of the board to have the name of the town changed from Lansing to Center, effective April 1, 1853.
