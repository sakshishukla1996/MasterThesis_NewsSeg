The community began as a lumber camp in 1850 when Capt.
Welcome Hyde, a lumberman, located on the bank of the Embarrass River and cut the first road into the area.
In 1880, when the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad was constructed through the area, F. W. Hyde built a store in what became Bear Creek Station.
In 1885, the land was platted for Welcome Hyde and named Bear Creek after the nearby stream.
After a disastrous fire in 1902, in which three-fourths of the town was destroyed, the people rebuilt and incorporated the community as a village, named Welcome after its first settler.
The name was changed back to Bear Creek in 1915 because of the confusion resulting from the village and the railroad station having different names.
