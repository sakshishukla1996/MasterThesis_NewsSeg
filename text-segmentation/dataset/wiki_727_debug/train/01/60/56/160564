========,1,preface.
Darlington is a large market town in County Durham, in North East England, and part of the Tees Valley.
With a population of 106,000 in 2011, the town lies on the River Skerne, a tributary of the River Tees.
The town owes much of its development to the influence of local Quaker families in the Georgian and Victorian era, and who provided much of the finance and vision in creating the Stockton and Darlington Railway, the world's first steam locomotive powered, permanent passenger railway.
The town is often colloquially referred to as 'Darlo'.
========,2,History.
========,3,Early history.
Darlington started life as an Anglo-Saxon settlement.
The name Darlington derives from the Anglo-Saxon "Dearthington", which seemingly meant 'the settlement of Deornoth's people', but by Norman times the name had changed to Derlinton.
During the 17th and 18th centuries the town was generally known by the name of Darnton.
Darlington has a historic market area in the town centre.
Built in 1183, the Grade I listed St Cuthbert's Church is one of the most important early English churches in the north of England.
However the oldest church in the town happens to be that of St Andrew's Church built around 1125 and presides in the Haughton area of Darlington.
Visiting during the 18th century, Daniel Defoe noted that the town was eminent for "good bleaching of linen, so that I have known cloth brought from Scotland to be bleached here".
However he also disparaged the town, writing that it had "nothing remarkable but dirt" (the roads would typically be unpaved at the time).
The Durham Ox came from Darlington.
========,3,19th-century industry.
During the early 19th century, Darlington remained a small market town.
As the century progressed, powerful Quaker families such as the Pease and Backhouse families were prominent employers and philanthropists in the area.
Darlington's most famous landmark, the clock tower, was a gift to the town by the industrialist Joseph Pease in 1864.
The clock's face was produced by T. Cooke & Sons of York, and the tower bells were cast by John Warner & Sons of nearby Norton-on-Tees.
These bells were in fact the sister bells to those which are inside the Elizabeth Tower at the Houses of Parliament in London, the most famous of which is called Big Ben.
The Darlington Mechanics Institute was opened in 1854 by Elizabeth Pease Nichol, who had made the largest donation towards its building costs.
The 91-acre South Park was redeveloped into its current form in 1853, with financial backing from the Backhouse family.
Alfred Waterhouse, responsible for London's Natural History Museum and Manchester Town Hall, designed the Grade II listed Victorian Market Hall in 1860, and also the Backhouse's Bank building, now a branch of Barclays, in 1864, the latter taking three years to complete.
George Gordon Hoskins was responsible for much of the town's architecture in this period, such as "The King's Hotel".
The "Darlington Free Library" was built with funding from Edward Pease, and opened in 1885 when the Council accepted the gift of the purpose built, fully stocked library and agreed to run it in perpetuity.
========,4,Railways.
Darlington is known for its associations with the birth of the modern railway.
This is celebrated in the town at Darlington Railway Centre and Museum.
On the 27th of September 1825 George Stephenson's engine Locomotion No.1 ushered in the modern railway age when it is travelled between Shildon and Stockton-on-Tees via Darlington, on the Stockton and Darlington Railway, which from its outset was designed for passengers and goods, to a standard gauge on a permanent main line with branches and powered by steam locomotives.
The town later became an important centre for railway manufacturing.
An early railway works was the Hopetown Carriage Works (est.1853) which supplied carriages and locomotives to the Stockton and Darlington Railway.
The engineering firm of William and Alfred Kitching also manufactured locomotives in the 19th century.
The town developed to have three significant works; the largest of these was the main line Darlington Works, whose main works were known as the North Road Shops which opened in 1863 and closed in 1966.
Another was Robert Stephenson & Co. (colloquially: "Stivvies"), who moved to Darlington from Newcastle upon Tyne in 1902, became Robert Stephensons & Hawthorns in 1937, were absorbed by English Electric around 1960, and closed by 1964.
The third was Faverdale Wagon Works, established in 1923 and closed in 1962, which in the 1950s was a UK pioneer in the application of mass-production techniques to the manufacture of railway goods wagons.
To commemorate the town's contribution to the railways, David Mach's 1997 work "Train" is located alongside the A66, close to the original Stockton–Darlington railway.
It is a life-size brick sculpture of a steaming locomotive emerging from a tunnel, made from 185,000 "Accrington Nori" bricks.
The work had a budget of £760,000.
For 19 years, the A1 Steam Locomotive Trust built a 50th member of the long withdrawn LNER Peppercorn Class A1 engine, called 'Tornado' and numbered 60163, from scratch in the 1853 former Stockton and Darlington Railway Carriage Works at Hopetown.
Many of the original fleet had been built at Darlington locomotive works in the late 1940s.
========,4,Engineering.
Darlington has long been a centre for engineering, particularly bridge building.
Bridges built in Darlington are found as far away as the River Nile and the River Amazon.
The large engineering firm Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company still has its headquarters in the town.
The firm built the Tyne Bridge, Middlesbrough Transporter Bridge and the Humber Bridge, as well as the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
One of the leading engine building firms, Cummins, has major premises in Darlington, and it houses the industrial headquarters of AMEC.
The engineering companies Darlington Forge Company (cl.1967) and Whessoe also originated in Darlington.
========,3,Other.
In 1870, "The Northern Echo" newspaper was launched.
It is based in Priestgate and is a long-standing part of life in the North East.
Although a regional paper, it is a full-bodied newspaper in its own right and includes national and international news in its scope, as well as having a well-maintained website and active social media presence.
William Thomas Stead was a notable editor of "The Northern Echo" who died in 1912 on the Titanic.
Opposite The Northern Echo building is The William Stead public house, restaurant and beer garden.
========,3,Recent history.
In 1939, Darlington had the most cinema seats per head of population in the United Kingdom.
The town centre has undergone a full refurbishment entitled "The Pedestrian Heart", which has seen the majority of the town centre pedestrianised.
Initially, the project received criticism surrounding changes to public transport, and removal of Victorian features along High Row.
There is now growing evidence, however, that the now-completed changes are meeting with local approval.
Then in 2014, the town saw the revamp of one of its old cinemas, The Majestic, into a soft play centre and theatre.
In August 2008 the King's Hotel in the town centre was devastated by fire, severely damaging the roof and 100 bedrooms.
Several shops, including Woolworths, were damaged and had to close for weeks afterwards.
No one was killed in the blaze.
The hotel was carefully restored to its former glory and re-opened in 2012.
========,2,Government.
On 1 April 1997, the Borough of Darlington became a unitary authority area with the formation of Darlington Borough Council, which separated it from the non-metropolitan county of Durham for administrative purposes only, as the town is still within County Durham for ceremonial purposes.
Currently a Labour seat, the current MP is Labour's Jenny Chapman.
Former members of parliament for the town include Alan Milburn, the former Secretary of State for Health under the Tony Blair Labour Government and Michael Fallon, the current Secretary of State for Defence under the David Cameron Coalition Government.
========,2,Geography.
Darlington is located in south Durham close to the River Tees which acts as the border between Durham and Yorkshire.
Both the River Tees and River Skerne pass through the town, the River Skerne later joining the River Tees which then flows through Teesside and into the North Sea.
Darlington railway station lies on the East Coast Main Line.
There are also local services from the historic North Road railway station and associated Darlington Railway Centre and Museum.
Neighbouring towns include Newton Aycliffe, Stockton and Bishop Auckland.

Another major employer in the area is the English division of the Student Loans Company, Student Finance England, who are based at Lingfield Point and employ over 1,000 people.
Nevertheless, there are major engineering sites, with both Cleveland Bridge and the industrial arm of AMEC headquartered in the town.
Another major firm within the engineering industry based in the town is Cummins which has a large scale engine building facility in the Morton Park area of Darlington.
UK retail company Argos have their largest warehouse distribution centre in the North of England located in Darlington, within Faverdale Industrial Estate to the North West of the town.
Other large service sector companies with offices in the town include Darlington Building Society, Bannatyne Fitness Ltd and the national vehicle rental company Northgate, which is headquartered in the town; also within the Morton Park area.
As well as the large engineering sites based in the town, Darlington is also home to many businesses within the modern and developing industries including Information Technology.
With large firms such as Infoserve Ltd having offices within the Morton Park area to the east of Darlington, located next to the A66 Darlington Eastern Bypass.
Close to the Darlington A66 Bypass is also the Link66 redevelopment scheme, which is a large plot of land close to the Morton Park site.
It is hoped developers will see potential in the site due to its excellent transport links with fast access to the town centre and central park regeneration zone via the new Darlington Eastern Transport Corridor constructed in 2008.
While also being in close proximity to the A1(M) Motorway which heads south to London and north to Edinburgh.
In November 2012, a deal was signed between Darlington Borough Council and developer Terrace Hill for a £30 million re-development of the site of the former Feethams bus depot.
The development includes a new multiplex cinema run by Vue Cinemas to serve Darlington and the wider South Durham area, as the area currently has no multiplex cinema.
Residents currently have to travel to Teesside for the nearest multiplex cinema.
The development will also house a new 80 bedroom Premier Inn hotel, and various food and drink venues including Prezzo, Bella Pasta and Hungry Horse.
The proposal had an expected completion date of late 2014, though this did overrun with completion early 2016.
Darlington Borough Council also announced the neighbouring site, previously a car park for the town hall, was also to be redeveloped to house riverside office space for the Department for Education in an effort to safeguard Darlington jobs.
This was officially opened on 19 March 2015.
The international telecommunications company BT Group recently announced Darlington as one of the economically important locations in England to have BT fibre-optic cables installed underground as part of the company's BT Infinity superfast broadband rollout project.
BT Group cites their decision to include Darlington in the national rollour of multi-provider fibre optic (cable) broadband as necessary due to the towns relatively large amount of IT demanding firms and future plans for developments including space for high-tech firms.
Darlington Borough Council, residents and local businesses praised the decision by BT Group and it is hoped the investment will attract enterprise to the town, potentially creating employment for residents and boosting the economy.
The Morton Park area of Darlington is currently undergoing a partial redevelopment, with areas of unused waste land being redeveloped into modern industrial and office space, the developments add to the plans for redevelopment of the current Council depot on Central Park which is also to be redeveloped into commercial space and the Link66 scheme also close to Morton Park.
Other commercial spaces in Darlington include North Road Industrial Estate, which includes a Morrisons superstore supermarket; Cleveland Trading Estate and Faverdale Industrial Estate.

========,2,Culture.
Darlington has been subject to increasing amounts of inward investment in recent years with the completion of large scale local council sponsored schemes such as the 2007 Town Centre Pedestrian Heart Project worth 10 million pounds, which saw most of Darlington Town Centre modernised with an emphasis on fewer vehicles in the centre and roads pedestrianised completely.
The town is also received further investment worth 170 million pounds with the creation of Central Park, a new industrial, residential, cultural and education park which includes hundreds of new affordable homes, Darlington College Campus, Teesside University Darlington Campus, luxury office space, retail units and a new local centre.
The Central Park construction site stretches from the current Darlington College campus on Haughton road to the Darlington Railway station entrance at Yarm Road.
Furthermore, the local council, regional development agency and government departments are consulting about investing in an upgrade of Darlington's A66 Eastern Bypass to dual carriageway to improve congestion and journey times, as well as to prevent the tees valley region from suffering due to the road currently being single track passing Darlington which is essentially the gateway to the tees valley region.
All of the investment in recent years and planned investment with large scale public sector support makes Darlington the most invested in Borough in the Tees Valley region, with Stockton a close second.
The Civic Theatre is a popular arts venue in the town, hosting a mix of musicals, dramas, plays and pantomimes.
The smaller but well-used Arts Centre, founded in 1982, featured smaller events, film screenings and more experimental material; however this closed in 2012.
Darlington is well known within the North of England as being tolerant of diverse lifestyles as it was the first town in England to allow same-sex civil ceremonies in 2001.
