========,2,Delta Heritage Trail.
In 1992, the Union Pacific Railroad discontinued service on a rail line which ran directly through Watson, and a right-of-way on which the rail line ran was donated to the State of Arkansas.
Parts of the abandoned rail line have since been converted into the Delta Heritage Trail.
The portion of the trail passing through Watson is still under construction.
When complete, the town will find itself uniquely positioned for visitors wishing to access the trail.
A vast wilderness lies to the north of the town, where the trail will offer spectacular views of the Arkansas River (from the Yancopin Bridge), and of the White River (from the Benzal Bridge).
Between the bridges, the trail will traverse old-growth hardwood forest within the Trusten Holder State Wildlife Management Area.
