========,2,History.
According to David Leighton of the Arizona Daily Star newspaper, Three Points, also known as Robles Junction was founded in 1882.
Bernabe S. Robles, who born in 1857, in Baviácora, Sonora, Mexico.
His family relocated to Tucson in 1864, where he grew up.
After spending sometime in Florence, Arizona, he returned to Tucson and accepted a mail route to Gunsight, Arizona, near Ajo.
It was during this time he located what is now called Robles Pass, near Cat (Back) Mountain, while searching for a shorter route to Gunsight.
In 1882, he had his brother Jesus homesteaded 160 acres at what is now Robles Junction/Three Points.
The brothers dug a well to set up a watering stop and stage station so Bernabe could water his horses along his mail route.
He eventually gave up his mail route, and moved to the former watering stop/stage station, which at that point was called the Robles Ranch.
He and his family ran the ranch for many years, even after the family had moved back to Tucson.
Robles died in 1945.
The old ranch house is now the Three Points/Robles Junction Community Center.
