Williams is named after William "Old Bill" Williams, a mountain man and trader who often trapped in the area.
Founded in 1881, Williams was named for the famous trapper, scout and mountain man, "Old Bill Williams."
A statue of "Old Bill" stands in Monument Park, located on the west side of the city.
The large mountain directly south of town is named Bill Williams Mountain and the Town was incorporated July 9, 1901.
Williams was the last town to have its section of Route 66 bypassed, due to lawsuits that kept the last section of Interstate 40 in Arizona from being built around the town.
After settlements called for the state to build three Williams exits, the suits were dropped and I-40 was completed.
On October 13, 1984, Interstate 40 was opened around the town and newspapers the next day reported the essential end of US 66.
The following year, Route 66 was decommissioned.
