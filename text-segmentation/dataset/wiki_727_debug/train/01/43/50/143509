========,2,Geography.
This province is located in the mountainous Sistema Ibérico area.
The main ranges in the province of Teruel are Sierra de la Virgen, Sierra de Santa Cruz, Sierra de Cucalón, Sierra de San Just, Sierra Carrascosa, Sierra Menera, Sierra Palomera, Sierra de Javalambre, Sierra de Gúdar, Sierra de Albarracín and the Montes Universales, among others.
========,2,Depopulation and neglect.
Most of the Teruel Province has undergone massive depopulation since the middle of the 20th century.
This situation is shared with other areas in Spain, particularly with those near the Iberian mountain range (much of the provinces of Soria, Guadalajara and Cuenca) and with other areas in Aragón.
The exodus from the rural mountain areas in Teruel rose after General Franco's "Plan de Estabilización" in 1959.
The population declined steeply as people migrated towards the industrial areas and the large cities in Spain, leaving behind their small villages where living conditions were often harsh, with cold winters and very basic facilities.
As a consequence there are many ghost towns in different parts of the province.
A great number of surviving towns in Teruel province have only a residual population, reviving somewhat during the summer when a few city-dwellers spend their holidays there.
Other causes of the strong emigration have been the low productivity of traditional agricultural practices, like sheep and goat farming, the closing of mines, like the large Sierra Menera mine near Ojos Negros, as well as the lifestyle changes that swept over rural Spain during the second half of the 20th century.
The "Teruel Exists" () movement began at the turn of the 21st century.
It is a platform of provincial authorities, institutions and sympathizers seeking to reverse the long-standing neglect of this province.
