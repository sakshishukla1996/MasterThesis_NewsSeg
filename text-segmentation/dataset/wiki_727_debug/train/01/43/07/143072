========,1,preface.
Vatnajökull (), also known as the Water Glacier in English, is the largest and most voluminous ice cap in Iceland, and one of the largest in area in Europe.
It is the second largest glacier in area after Austfonna on Svalbard in Norway but, nevertheless, larger by volume.
It is located in the south-east of the island, covering more than 8 percent of the country.
========,2,Size.
With an area of 8,100 km², Vatnajökull is the largest ice cap in Europe by volume (3,100 km³) and the second-largest (after Austfonna on Nordaustlandet, Svalbard, Norway) in area (not counting the still larger Severny Island ice cap of Novaya Zemlya, Russia, which may be regarded as located in the extreme northeast of Europe).
On 7 June 2008, it became a part of the Vatnajökull National Park.
The average thickness of the ice is , with a maximum thickness of .
Iceland's highest peak, Hvannadalshnúkur (), is located in the southern periphery of Vatnajökull, near Skaftafell National Park.
========,2,Volcanoes.
Under the ice cap, as under many of the glaciers of Iceland, there are several volcanoes.
The volcanic lakes, Grímsvötn for example, were the sources of a large jökulhlaup (glacial lake outburst flood) in 1996.
There was also a considerable but short-time eruption of the volcano under these lakes at the beginning of November 2004.
In May 21, 2011 a volcanic eruption started in Grímsvötn in Vatnajökull National Park at around 7 p.m.
The plume reached as high as .
During the last ice age, numerous volcanic eruptions occurred under Vatnajökull, creating many subglacial eruptions.
New ice caves form each year due to the melting glacial ice-water.
Those caves can be visited accompanied by a guide.
========,2,Sight line.
According to "Guinness World Records" ("GWR"), Vatnajökull is supposedly the object of the world's longest sight line, from Slættaratindur, the highest mountain in the Faroe Islands.
"GWR" claims that "owing to the light bending effects of atmospheric refraction, Vatnajökull (2,109.6 m), Iceland, can sometimes be seen from the Faroe Islands, away".
This may be based on an alleged sighting by a British sailor in 1939.
========,2,In culture.
In 1950, a Douglas DC-4 operated by the private airline Loftleiðir crash-landed on the Vatnajökull glacier.
The glacier was used as the setting for the opening sequence (set in Siberia) of the 1985 James Bond film "A View to a Kill", in which Bond (played for the last time by Roger Moore) eliminated a host of armed villains before escaping in a submarine to Alaska.
Several other films, including another in the Bond franchise, have been filmed on or using Jökulsárlón, the terminal lake of the Breiðamerkurjökull outlet from Vatnajökull.
In November 2011, the glacier was used as a shooting location for the second season of the HBO fantasy TV series "Game of Thrones".
========,2,Outlet glaciers.
Vatnajökull has around 30 outlet glaciers flowing from the ice cap.
The Icelandic term for glacier is "jökull", and so is the term for outlet glacier.
Given below is a list of outlet glaciers flowing from Vatnajökull, sorted by the four administrative territories of Vatnajökull National Park.
