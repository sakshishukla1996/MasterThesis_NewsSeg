========,1,preface.
The Beatles Anthology is the name of a television documentary, a three-volume set of double albums, and a book focusing on the history of the Beatles.
Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr all participated in the making and approval of the works, which are sometimes referred to collectively as the "Anthology" project, while John Lennon had archival interviews.
"The Beatles Anthology" documentary series was first broadcast in November 1995, with expanded versions released on VHS and Laserdisc in 1996 and on DVD in 2003.
The documentary used interviews with the Beatles and their associates to narrate the history of the band as seen through archival footage and performances.
The initial volume of the album set was released in conjunction with the documentary in November 1995, with the subsequent two volumes released in 1996.
The albums included unreleased performances and outtakes presented in roughly chronological order, along with two new songs based on demo tapes recorded by John Lennon after the group broke up.
The book, released in 2000, paralleled the documentary in presenting the group's history through quotes from interviews.
========,2,Documentary series.
Approximately coinciding with the release of the "Free as a Bird" single and "Anthology 1" album (the first of three double-CD albums), "The Beatles Anthology" series of documentaries was broadcast on ITV in the United Kingdom and ABC television in the United States in 1995.
The "Anthology" series takes a form similar to that of the "Anthology" book, by being a series of first-person accounts by the Beatles themselves, with no external "objective" narration.
Footage in the "Anthology" series features voice-over recordings of all four Beatles to push the narrative of the story, with contributions from their producer, road manager and others.
As well as telling their story through archival footage, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and George Harrison appear in interview segments recorded exclusively for the series itself; John Lennon appears only in historic archival footage.
The Beatles' wives, past and present, do not appear (excluding archival footage such as video from India and the music video for Harrison's "Something").
The series, which was made over five years of planning and production, is composed of numerous film clips and interviews that present a complete history of the band from the Beatles' own personal perspectives.
When it aired on ABC, the series comprised six hour-long programs, aired on three nights in November 1995.
The series was later released, as eight expanded episodes, on VHS, laserdisc and as a boxed set of five DVDs (4 discs with 2 episodes apiece and a disc of extras).
Air dates on ABC:
***LIST***.
Part 1 of the series drew 17 million households, meaning an average of 27.3 million viewers, which was much better than usual for ABC at the time, but behind most broadcasts of "Friends" on NBC, which in its second season was averaging 29.4 million viewers per episode.
In promoting the series during this time, ABC identified itself as "A-Beatles-C"—an homage to the mid-1960s Cousin Brucie-era "77 W-A-Beatles-C" call sign of the network's flagship NYC AM radio station—and several of the network's prime-time sitcoms replaced their regular opening credit themes with Beatles tracks.
========,2,Albums.
To accompany the "Anthology" series, three albums were issued, each containing two CDs or three vinyl LPs of mostly never-before-released Beatles material (the exceptions being the Tony Sheridan-era material), although many of the tracks had appeared on bootlegs for many years prior.
Two days after the first television special in the series had aired, "Anthology 1" was released to stores, and included music recorded by the Quarrymen, the famous Decca Records audition tapes, and various out-takes and demos from the band's first four albums.
It also included the song "Lend Me Your Comb", omitted from the collection "Live at the BBC", released the previous year (1994).
The song "Free as a Bird" was included at the very start.
450,000 copies of "Anthology 1" were sold in its first day of release, the most sales for an album in a single day ever.
The band's first drummer Pete Best, replaced by Ringo Starr in 1962 before the Beatles recorded professionally for EMI, received his first substantial Beatles royalties from this album, for the inclusion of early demo tracks on which he played.
"Anthology 2" was released on 17 March 1996.
The second collection presented out-takes and demos from the Beatles' sessions for "Help!
", "Rubber Soul", "Revolver", "Sgt.
Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", and "Magical Mystery Tour".
These included selected early demos and takes for Lennon's "Strawberry Fields Forever", previously available only to bootleg collectors.
The new song "Real Love" — which, like "Free as a Bird", was based on an unfinished Lennon recording — was also included in the two-CD collection.
"Anthology 3" was released on 28 October 1996.
The third collection featured out-takes and demos from "The White Album", "Abbey Road", and "Let It Be" as well as several songs from Harrison and McCartney which later became post-Beatle tracks.
========,3,Collage.
The three album covers, when laid side-by-side, become one long painted collage of various peeling posters and album covers representing the different stages of the Beatles' career.
This was the work of Klaus Voormann, who also created the album cover for "Revolver" in 1966.
The "Anthology" covers required Voormann to recreate elements of his cover for "Revolver" within the collage.
During the music video for "Free as a Bird", the "Anthology" collage appears as posters on a shop window as the camera pans quickly across the street.
The design also adorned the VHS, laserdisc and DVD releases, again to be properly encountered by laying the cases side-by-side.
Upon the release of "Anthology 3", HMV stores made available a limited edition cardboard sleeve designed to hold all three CD volumes of which each side of the sleeve make up half of the collage.
========,2,Book.
In October 2000, "The Beatles Anthology" book was released, which included interviews with all four band members and others involved, plus rare photos.
Many of the interviews quoted are from those featured in the documentary films.
The book is designed as a large-format hardback, with imaginative artwork throughout, and several visually impressive and colourful spreads featuring graphics relevant to the proceeding chronology, photographic arrays and a variety of text styles and layouts.
The book went straight to the top of the "New York Times" bestsellers list.
In 2002, the book was released as a large-format paperback.
========,2,Unreleased recordings.
During early 1995 as work on "The Beatles Anthology" continued, Yoko Ono and McCartney recorded an avant-garde piece called "Hiroshima Sky Is Always Blue".
Ono provided vocals and McCartney played bass, while Sean Lennon, Linda McCartney, and McCartney's children played various instruments.
The piece was broadcast on Japanese public television in memory of the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.
The track "Carnival of Light" recorded during the "Sgt.
Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" sessions was intended to be released on the "Anthology 2" album, but was vetoed by George Harrison.
It was reported that McCartney, Harrison and Starr worked on a new composition called "All for Love" in March 1995, intended as a track on "Anthology 3", but the effort was abandoned.
No version of the song has reached the public.
========,2,Promotional items.
Each of the three "Anthology" albums was accompanied by a promotional CD sampler sent to radio stations shortly before the official release dates.
These CDs have since become highly sought collector's items.
Even rarer is a vinyl version of the sampler for "Anthology 2", which was only sent to college radio stations and featured a different cover (though the contents were the same).
In October 1996 there was a strictly limited release from EMI, a slip case cover to house all three CD volumes, which have since become extremely rare, fetching high prices among collectors.
========,2,Parodies.
The success of the "Anthology" albums was parodied by the release of the Rutles' "Archaeology" some months later.
Delays in the release of the third volume of the Beatles' series ultimately meant that the Rutles' parody arrived in shops on the same day as its inspiration.
"Weird Al" Yankovic parodied "The Beatles Anthology" in an "Al TV" special.
He said he had a copy of a fictional "Anthology 17", which he claimed would not be available to the public for a while.
He played for the audience a track of Paul McCartney brushing his teeth and Ringo Starr shaving before "The Ed Sullivan Show".
"The Beatles Anthology" was also parodied on the short-lived "Dana Carvey Show", which was being aired on ABC around the same time that "Anthology" was being televised on the network.
