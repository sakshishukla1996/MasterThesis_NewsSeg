========,1,preface.
Palacios ( ) is a city in Matagorda County, Texas, United States.
The population was 5,153 at the 2000 census.
========,2,Etymology.
Popular local legend states that the area was named Tres Palacios ("Three Palaces") several centuries ago by shipwrecked Spanish sailors who claimed they saw a vision of three palaces on the bay.
Historians believe it was more likely named for José Félix Trespalacios, an early Mexican governor of Texas.
The town was originally called Trespalacios, but shortened its name due to a nearby post office already using the longer version.
========,2,History.
The native inhabitants of the region were the Karankawa people, whose initial contact with Europeans came in the 16th century when Spanish expeditions first traversed their territory.
In 1685, the area was explored by René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, the leader of an ill-fated French settlement attempt whose flagship "La Belle" was wrecked in the bay the following year.
In the 1820s, English-speaking settlers arrived and came into frequent conflict with the Karankawa, who were eventually driven out of the area.
The future site of Palacios was ranch land until 1901, when it was put up for sale by the estate of the former owner, Abel "Shanghai" Pierce.
The land was purchased by a development company, surveyed into lots, and with the arrival of the Southern Pacific Railroad and the establishment of the Texas Baptist Encampment, it rapidly grew into a seaside resort town.
It was first settled as a community in 1903.
City government was established in 1909, and by 1915, Palacios was home to more than 100 businesses, with a post office, library, weekly newspaper, numerous hotels, and churches, as well as a large entertainment pavilion built on a pier in the bay.
In 1926, Camp Hulen (originally "Camp Palacios") was opened as a training center for the 36th Infantry of the Texas National Guard.
The camp was leased by the War Department during World War II, when it was developed into a major antiaircraft training facility with a peak troop capacity of 14,560, and also served as a detention center for German prisoners of war.
The population of Palacios boomed during this period, and the city hosted visiting stars such as Rita Hayworth and Glenn Miller.
After the war, Camp Hulen was closed and the local population declined.
The town was hit by Hurricane Carla in 1961, causing major damage.
Since then, the population has grown again, with the settlement of Vietnamese immigrants and other newcomers from all over the United States.
In 1991, a pavilion was rebuilt on the waterfront, and in 1995 the "La Belle" shipwreck was rediscovered at the bottom of the bay, becoming the focus of a major archeological excavation.
In 2009, the city marked its centennial with celebrations and other events.
