========,2,History.
Prior to the arrival of Europeans, San Angelo was the center of the Jumano people.
As of 1600, the area had been inhabited for over a thousand years by succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples.
In 1632, a short-lived mission of Franciscans under Spanish auspices was founded in the area to serve the Indians.
The mission was led by the friars Juan de Salas and Juan de Ortega, with Ortega remaining for six months.
The area was visited by the Castillo-Martin expedition of 1650 and the Diego de Guadalajara expedition of 1654.
During the colonization of the region, San Angelo was at the western edge of the region called Texas, successively claimed in the 1800s by the nations of Spain, Mexico, the Republic of Texas, and finally the United States, in 1846.
The current city of San Angelo was founded in 1867, when the United States built Fort Concho, one of a series of new forts designed to protect the frontier.
The fort was home to cavalry, infantry, and the famous Black Cavalry, also known as Buffalo Soldiers by Indigenous Americans.
The settler Bartholomew J. DeWitt founded the village of Santa Angela outside the fort at the junction of the North and South Concho Rivers.
He named the village after his wife, Carolina Angela.
The name was eventually changed to San Angela.
The name would change again to San Angelo in 1883 on the insistence of the United States Postal Service, as San Angela was grammatically incorrect in Spanish.
