The Garden of Eden is a permanent outdoor sculpture exhibit built between 1905 and 1927 by local sculptor Samuel P. Dinsmoor.
The site consists of Dinsmoor's home, a "log cabin" constructed of carved limestone, more than 150 sculptures representing his interpretation of the Biblical creation and world history, and a mausoleum housing the remains of Dinsmoor and his first wife.

Since 2002, Deeble's house has served as a gallery called the Garden of Isis, exhibiting works made from recycled materials by visual artist Mri-Pilar.
The Grassroots Arts Center is a non-profit gallery located downtown which promotes and exhibits the work of Kansas folk artists.
