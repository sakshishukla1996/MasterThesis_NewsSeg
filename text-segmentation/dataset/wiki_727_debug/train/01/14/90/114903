========,2,History.
In 1859, a hunting party explored the area, including a small tributary of the Saline River which led them to a site abundant in water, timber, and bison.
One of the hunters, James R. Mead, described the site as paradise, and the tributary subsequently became known as Paradise Creek.
The first post office in the area opened under the name Paradise in 1875.
In 1887, the Union Townsite Company established a town on the north side of the creek northwest of the post office, naming it Ivamar after Iva Marr, the daughter of a local rancher.
The Paradise post office relocated to Ivamar the next year, but kept its name.
As a result, the town came to be known by both names; in 1891, the Union Pacific Railroad listed its rail stop there as Paradise with Ivamar in parentheses.
The community grew through the 1890s to include a school, downtown businesses, and railroad facilities, reaching a population of 200 by 1910.
Ivamar incorporated in 1924 and finally changed its name to Paradise.
The population of the community has gradually declined since the 1930s.
