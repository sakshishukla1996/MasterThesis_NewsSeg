When the north-south Burlington, Cedar Rapids and Minnesota Railway was built, in 1870, it crossed the Rock Island at Clifton.
The first BCR&M train arrived on Feb. 7, 1870, and the first local business opened the next day, a restaurant and boarding house, in a building moved by rail from Muscatine, Iowa.
Just a month later, the town was platted.
Columbus City, Iowa had already been established before the railroads came through, and both the Rock Island and the BCR&M had missed Columbus City by over a mile.
As both Columbus City and Township had invested in the latter line, they were permitted to name the new town, so it became Columbus Junction.
