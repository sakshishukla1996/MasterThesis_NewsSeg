========,2,History.
========,3,19th century.
Concordia holds the distinction of being elected the county seat before the town was created.
The founder of the town, James M. Hagaman had created a complete layout of the town on paper including streets, blocks, courthouse, and parks.
The name "Concordia" was chosen because a member of the early group of promoters ("Cap" Snyder) had once lived in Concordia, Missouri.
December 1869 was the first election for the county seat with Concordia, Clyde and the now defunct town Sibley.
Without a clear majority, a second election was held between Concordia and Sibley on January 4, 1870.
Concordia was declared the winner over Sibley 165 votes to 129.
It was over a year later when Concordia officially became a town when the Republican Land District Office opened on January 16, 1871.
The Concordia Land Office continued until February 28, 1889 when it was consolidated with the land office in Topeka, Kansas.
Also in 1871, Concordia elected its first mayor, R. E. Allen.
Under his leadership, Concordia was officially incorporated as a third class city under Kansas law in August 1872.
Concordia was visited in its early years by many traveling shows.
As early as 1876 various traveling entertainers including Wild Bill Hickock, Buffalo Bill Cody, Ringling Brothers, and others came to Concordia.
In 1892, the Ringling train wrecked east of the town killing two men and twenty horses, but the show played the next day to a crowd of 4,000.
The first schoolteacher to teach inside the city limits was Milo Stevens, who was paid a salary of twenty dollars per month.
A state normal school was set up in Concordia in 1874 with F. E. Robinson as principal and former state Superintendent H. D. McCarty became president the second year.
In 1876 the state ceased to provide funding and the school was closed.
In 1887, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway built a branch line from Neva (3 miles west of Strong City) through Concordia to Superior, Nebraska.
In 1996, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway merged with Burlington Northern Railroad and renamed to the current BNSF Railway.
Most locals still refer to this railroad as the "Santa Fe".
In 1897, Pope Leo XIII founded the Roman Catholic Diocese of Concordia, Kansas.
The diocese operated until 1947 when it was merged with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Salina.
It was later restored as a titular see in 1995.
========,3,20th century.
Carrie Nation visited Concordia in the early 1900s.
Records are mixed, but the date is placed between 1908 and 1910.
The "Concordia Blade" newspaper (now the "Concordia Blade-Empire") reported:
"Carrie Nation is in town.
That wonderfully brave little woman who started the crusade against Kansas saloons lectured at the M.E.
Church this afternoon, and will talk again tonight at the courthouse.
While in this city she is the guest of Mrs. George Mohr."
A major geographic change in the city and the area occurred on July 9, 1902.
The Republican River flooded near town and broke a dam.
The flooding resulted in re-routing the river by 1/4 of a mile.
The year of 1912 brought a major blizzard to Concordia with snow so deep that a Union Pacific train became stuck northeast of town and snowbanks on main street piled as high as peoples' heads.
Also in 1912, the first official inspection team for Meridian Highway (now US-81) came through Concordia on their tour from Canada to Mexico.
In 1913, the Missouri Pacific Railway depot was rebuilt after a fire destroyed the old building.
Another flood took place on June 20, 1915.
Damage from the flood was significant but not as wide-sweeping as the flood of 1902.
