========,3,History.
Lima's first airport was the Limatambo Airport in San Isidro.

Also in 1960, the Lima-Callao International Airport opened.
In June 1965, the Lima-Callao airport was renamed the "Aeropuerto Internacional Jorge Chávez" after the famous Peruvian aviator, Jorge Chávez Dartnell.
In December 1965, the terminal building was officially opened.
When it was in operation, Compañía de Aviación Faucett had its corporate headquarters on the airport grounds.
In 2001, in order to improve and expand its infrastructure, the government of Peru placed the airport under the management of Lima Airport Partners (LAP).
LAP is now composed of Fraport and two other minor partners.
