========,2,History.
Wittenberg College was founded in 1845 by a group of ministers in the English Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Ohio, which had previously separated from the recently established German-speaking Evangelical Lutheran Joint Synod of Ohio and Other States.
A German American pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, the Rev.
Ezra Keller was the principal founder and first president of the college.
Its initial focus was to train clergy with the Hamma School of Divinity as its theological department.
One of its main missions was to "Americanize" Lutherans by teaching courses in the English language instead of German, unlike the nearby Capital University in Columbus, Ohio.
The first class originally consisted of eight students at the beginning of the academic year, but grew to seventy-one by the end.
With a faculty of one professor and two tutors, classes were held in Springfield, Ohio in a church on land that was donated.
That city was selected for its location on the National Road, running from the East's cities of Baltimore and mountainous Cumberland, Maryland to the West in the Illinois Country, eventually to the territorial capital of Vandalia, near the Mississippi River.
In 1874, women were admitted to the college, and, the following year, blacks were admitted.
The name of the school came from the historic Wittenberg University, in Wittenberg, Germany, the town where then Roman Catholic priest and theological professor Martin Luther, (1483-1546), famously posted his "95 Theses" on the chapel church door on October 31, 1517.
========,3,Hamma Divinity School (Wittenberg's Theological Department).
Luther Alexander Gotwald, D.D., (1833–1900), Professor of Theology in the "Hamma Divinity School" which served as the Theological Department of the College was famously tried for and unanimously acquitted of heresy by the Board of Directors at Wittenberg on April 4 and April 5, 1893, which put on trial many key issues that Evangelical Lutherans still debate today.
For decades, Hamma and Wittenberg in Springfield were associated with the local English-speaking regional synods in the Midwest.
In 1978, Hamma Divinity School merged with the nearby "Evangelical Lutheran Theological Seminary" in the Bexley suburb of the state capital of Columbus, Ohio, associated with "Capital University".

The library was built 1956 to the designs of Thomas Norman Mansell of Mansell, Lewis & Fugate of Wynnewood, Pennsylvania.
In 1995, the American Philosophical Association censured Wittenberg University for violating the professional rights of one its members, then a faculty member in the philosophy department denied tenure for unjust reasons.
In that instance, the Wittenberg administration overruled the faculty personnel board's authority and asserted its right to deny tenure for reasons beyond teaching, research and service.
The current administration makes no such assertion.
