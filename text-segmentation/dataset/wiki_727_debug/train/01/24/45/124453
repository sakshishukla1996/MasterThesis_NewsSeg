Tonopah is an unincorporated town in and the county seat of Nye County, Nevada, United States.
It is located at the junction of U.S.
Routes 6 and 95, approximately midway between Las Vegas and Reno.
In the 2010 census, the population was 2,478.
The census-designated place (CDP) of Tonopah has a total area of , all land.
========,2,History.
The European-American community began circa 1900 with the discovery of silver-rich ore by prospector Jim Butler.
The legendary tale of discovery says that he went looking for a burro that had wandered off during the night and sought shelter near a rock outcropping.
When Butler discovered the animal the next morning, he picked up a rock to throw at it in frustration, noticing that the rock was unusually heavy.
He had stumbled upon the second-richest silver strike in Nevada history.
Men of wealth and power entered the region to consolidate the mines and reinvest their profits into the infrastructure of the town of Tonopah.
George Wingfield, a 24-year-old poker player when he arrived in Tonopah, played poker and dealt faro in the town saloons.
Once he had a small bankroll, he talked Jack Carey, owner of the Tonopah Club, into taking him in as a partner and to file for a gaming license.
In 1903, miners rioted against Chinese workers in Tonopah.
This resulted in China enforcing a boycott in China of U.S. imported goods.
By 1904, after investing his winnings in the Boston-Tonopah Mining Company, Wingfield was worth $2 million.
When old friend George S. Nixon, a banker, arrived in town, Wingfield invested in his Nye County Bank.
They grub-staked miners with friend Nick Abelman, and bought existing mines.
By the time the partners moved to Goldfield, Nevada and made their Goldfield Consolidated Mining Company a public corporation in 1906, Nixon and Wingfield were worth more than $30 million.
Wingfield believed that the end of the gold and silver mining production was coming and took his bankroll to Reno, where he invested heavily in real estate and casinos.
Real estate and gaming became big business throughout Central Nevada.
By 1910, gold production was falling and by 1920, the town of Tonopah had less than half the population it had fifteen years earlier.
Small mining ventures continued to provide income for local miners and the small town struggled on.
Located about halfway between Reno and Las Vegas, it has supported travelers as a stopover and rest spot on a lonely highway.
Today the Tonopah Station has slots and the Banc Club also offers some gaming.
Also in Nye County is the Yomba Band of the Yomba Indian Reservation, a federally recognized band of Western Shoshone people.
The Western Shoshone dominated most of Nevada at the time of European-American settlement in the 1860s.
Since the late 20th century, Tonopah has relied on the nearby military Tonopah Test Range as its main source of employment.
The military has used the range and surrounding areas as a nuclear bomb test site, a bombing range, and as a base of operations for the development of the F-117 Nighthawk.
In the fall of 2011, a California-based solar energy company, SolarReserve, started construction on $980 million advanced solar energy project just outside town called the Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Project.
The project incorporates SolarReserve's advanced solar energy storage technology and will put Tonopah at the worldwide center of technology for this class of solar energy storage.
The project construction activities, which peaks at 800 workers on site, was scheduled to be completed in 2014.
========,2,Etymology and pronunciation.
Founder, Jim Butler named the settlement, from what is thought to be a Shoshone language word, pronounced "TOE-nuh-pah."
Although the town previously had a variety of names, including Butler City, Jim Butler's name has survived.
According to local history, the name is said to mean "hidden spring".
Linguistically the name derives from either Shoshone "to-nuv" (greasewood), or Northern Paiute "to-nav" (greasewood), and "pa," meaning water in both dialects.

========,2,Transportation.
During the silver bonanza of the first decade of the 20th century, the need in the precious-metal fields for freight service led to construction of a network of local railroad lines across the Nevada desert to Tonopah.
Examples include the Las Vegas and Tonopah Railroad, the Tonopah and Goldfield Railroad, and the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad.
Coal was hauled to the silver mines to power mine operations and also the stamp mills built in and around Tonopah to break apart the hard-rock ore for milling and refining.
As the railroad lines were reduced with the decline of mining and restructuring of railroads in the late 20th century, 18-wheelers became the dominant method of moving freight.
Tonopah took on a new identity as an extreme freight destination.
The chorus of the song "Willin'" by Lowell George of Little Feat on the albums "Little Feat," "Sailin' Shoes," and "Waiting for Columbus" refers to either Tonopah, Arizona, or Tonopah, Nevada:
In the early 21st century, Tonopah is served by two U.S.
Highways, Routes 6 and 95.
There is no rail service.
General aviation facilities are located at nearby Tonopah Airport.
The nearest airport with scheduled passenger service is Mammoth Yosemite Airport, about 100 miles away.
