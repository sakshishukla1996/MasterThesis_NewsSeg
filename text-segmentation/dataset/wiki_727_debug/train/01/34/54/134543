========,2,History.
Elgin, previously named Blaney, and originally Jeffers, traces its European-American history to a post office established in the area in 1898.
The small community that the post office served adopted the name Jeffers after its first postmaster, William T. Jeffers.
The community did not see much growth until the Seaboard Air Line Railroad began expansion in the area in 1900.
Development occurred near the railroad depot and post office.
Seaboard agents, in an effort to increase use of the rail line, promoted business all along its route, including Jeffers.
The town, and post office, was eventually renamed Blaney in honor of a New York banker who helped fund the railroad expansion in the region.
The town of Blaney was officially chartered and incorporated on January 23, 1908.
The Blaney's first postmaster, Jesse T. Ross (who served for forty-seven years), was the first man to open a business, together with D. D. Evans.
The village erected a brick schoolhouse was erected in 1912.
Very little growth was seen in the town during the next 15 years; the "Camden Chronicle" said in 1927: "I don't think there were fifty people in [Blaney], in fact you wouldn't know it was a town."
However, by 1930, Blaney had built its own high school.
In 1931 U.S. Highway 1 was completed.
A fully paved road extending along the length of the eastern seaboard, it ran parallel to the already established rail line as it cut through Blaney.
This offered a new route to bring in tourism and business to the area.
It is still the main route into the town today.
In the late 1950s, postwar industrial development took place throughout the West Wateree Area along U.S. Highway 1.
In 1958 a deal was closed with the Whitehead Brothers Sand Company, which opened up a $300,000 sand foundry between Lugoff and Blaney.
State Senator John West recruited the Elgin National Watch Company in 1962 to relocate to the area.
The company was attracted to the unused land and potential labor market to be recruited from nearby Columbia.
Residents voted to change the town's name from Blaney to Elgin in a landslide 61-16 vote.
In September 1962, plans were confirmed to build a $1 million assembly plant in the town.
The plant offered 240 jobs and received over a thousand applications when the hiring process started.
Due to the new plant, the town upgraded the area's water supply system.
By 1963, Elgin was drilling wells as part of a new $150,000 water system, and the plant had begun production.
In 1967, officials from the Elgin National Watch Company announced that the plant would be sold to B. F. Goodrich, a manufacturer of tennis shoes, due to the company's inability to compete with foreign-made products.
That year, the Hardwicke Chemical Company broke ground at a 15-acre site near Elgin.
Elgin's growth has continued in recent years.
In 2005, a new sewer system was completed for the town and a new municipal complex was finished to house the town hall, police department, and fire station.
The town grew by over 50% between the 2000 and 2010 census, going from 806 to 1311 residents with continued growth expected in the future.
Elgin's current mayor is Melissa Emmons.
