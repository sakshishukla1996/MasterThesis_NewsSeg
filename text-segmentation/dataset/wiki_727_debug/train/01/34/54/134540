Ridgeland is home to the Ridgeland Correctional Institution, a medium security prison operated by the South Carolina Department of Corrections.
Ridgeland was originally known as Gopher Hill in 1894, derived from the "gopher tortoise," which is indigenous to the area but that name was not considered good enough for a new railroad station so it was changed to Ridgeland in 1902 for the fact the town stands upon the highest hill between Charleston and Savannah.
