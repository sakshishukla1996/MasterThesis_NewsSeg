========,1,preface.
Kiawah is a sea island, or barrier island, on the Atlantic coast of the United States.
Located southwest of Charleston in Charleston County, South Carolina, it is operated today largely as a gated beach and golf resort—the Kiawah Island Golf Resort—with spacious villas, beaches, large and acclaimed golf courses, and other attractions.
As of the 2010 census, Kiawah Island's population was 1,626, up from 1,163 at the 2000 census.
The island is part of the Charleston-North Charleston-Summerville metropolitan area.
Alternative spellings and variants of the name itself include "Kiawa", "Kittiwar" (in DuBose Heyward's novel "Porgy"), and "Kittiwah" (in George Gershwin's opera "Porgy and Bess").
========,2,History.
The Bass Pond Site and Arnoldus Vander Horst House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Kiawah was named for the Kiawah Indians who were led by their head chieftain or cassique.
In the year 1670, the cassique of the Kiawah led English colonists to settle at Charlestowne Landing.
========,2,Development.
Long held by the Vanderhorst family, Kiawah Island was purchased by C.C.
Royal in 1950 for logging and timber; he went on to develop the first summer home neighborhood in 1954 along the beach and named the street Eugenia, after his wife.
In 1974 Royal's heirs sold the island to Kuwait Investment Corporation; soon after, a thorough environmental survey is conducted, and a master plan for Kiawah's development is produced.
Two years later, in 1976, real estate sales commenced and the Cougar Point (formerly Marsh Point) golf course was opened.
The 1980s saw the opening of two of the seven golf courses associated with Kiawah-Turtle Point in 1981 and Osprey Point in 1988.
1988 also saw all resort assets and amenities, along with Kiawah's undeveloped lands purchased by the development group, Kiawah Resort Associates (KRA), owned by Charles P. Darby III and Patrick W. McKinney, et al.
The Town of Kiawah was also established in the same year.
Following the impact of Hurricane Hugo in 1989, KRA sold resort assets to Landmark Land Co., who would then sell the assets to William H. Goodwin in 1993.
The 90s saw the establishment of the Kiawah Island Club in 1993 and the addition of three more courses: the Ocean Course in 1991, the River Course in 1995, and Oak Point in 1997.
The final of Kiawah's associated golf courses, Cassique, was opened in 2000.
Freshfields Village, a town-center type mix of shopping, dining, and services saw ground broken in 2004.
That same year, The Sanctuary hotel opened on the island.
In 2013, Darby and associates sold Kiawah Partners to the South Street Partners for an estimated $350 million.
This transaction included Kiawah Island Club, Kiawah Island Real Estate, Freshfields Village, Kiawah Island Utility, and other domestic and international holdings.
