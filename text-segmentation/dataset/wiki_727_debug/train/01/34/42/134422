========,2,History.
Lincolnville was founded in 1867 by seven African-American men, including Bishop Richard Harvey Cain, who left their former home of Charleston to escape the racial discrimination they felt subject to in that environment.
Riding the local South Carolina Special train to examine properties for sale by the South Carolina Railroad Company, the men settled on this area that was then known as "Pump Pond" for its use as a train stopping point for water, wood and coal.
The men signed a contract with the railroad company to purchase for $1,000.
After paying the agreed amount in full, a charter for establishment of the town was applied for and later received on December 14, 1889.
The name "Lincolnville" was given to the settlement in honor of Abraham Lincoln.
