========,2,History.
The island's original inhabitants were the Sewee tribe.
During the Civil War, the "H.L.
Hunley" departed from Breach Inlet, between Isle of Palms and Sullivan's Island.
In the late nineteenth century, local residents began using the island as a vacation spot.
At that time it was only accessible by ferry.
It was bought by J.S.
Lawrence in 1899, who gave the island its current name; before then it was known as "Hunting Island" or "Long Island".
A 50-room hotel was built in 1906.
In 1912, James Sottile had a beach pavilion and an amusement park built, and a trolley line was constructed from Mount Pleasant on the mainland to Isle of Palms via Sullivan's Island.
In 1929, Grace Memorial Bridge was built between Charleston and Mount Pleasant to allow automobile traffic to reach the island.
Large-scale residential development began when J.C. Long bought up most of the island and built low-cost housing for World War II veterans.
In 1975, the Sea Pines Company (of Hilton Head Island fame) established the development now known as the Wild Dunes Beach and Racquet Club.
E. Lee Spence, a pioneer underwater archaeologist and prolific author of books and articles about shipwrecks and sunken treasure, discovered, with the help of Isle of Palms residents Wally Shaffer and George Campsen, many shipwrecks along the shores of the Isle of Palms in the 1960s.
Their discoveries included the Civil War blockade runners "Rattlesnake", "Stonewall Jackson", "Mary Bowers", "Constance", "Norseman" and the "Georgiana".
The iron-hulled steamer "Georgiana", which was sunk on her maiden voyage, was described in contemporary documents as pierced for 14 guns and more powerful than the famous Confederate cruiser "Alabama".
These historic discoveries resulted in the passage of South Carolina's Underwater Antiquities Act allowing the archaeological salvage of shipwrecks.
During Hurricane Hugo, which struck September 21, 1989, much of the island was flooded by the storm surge.
The northeastern end of the Isle of Palms, which is home to the private community of Wild Dunes, endured a severe erosion crisis as a shoal attached to that section of the island and caused sand to be washed away from around the foundation of a large condominium.
The city undertook a controversial beach restoration project in the spring and summer of 2008 which replenished the beach with dredged sand and saved the threatened structures.
