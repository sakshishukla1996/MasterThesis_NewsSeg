========,1,preface.
David Murray "Dav" Pilkey Jr. (born March 4, 1966) is an American author and illustrator of children's literature.
Pilkey is best known as the author and illustrator of the children's book series "Captain Underpants" and "Dumb Bunnies", the latter of which are written under the name Sue Denim.
========,2,Life and career.
Pilkey was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to Barbara and David Pilkey, Sr.
He has one older sister.
In elementary school in Elyria, Ohio, Pilkey was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia.
Pilkey was frequently reprimanded for his behavior in class and thus usually sat at a desk in the school hallway, where he created the "Captain Underpants" character.
Pilkey entered his first book, "World War Won", in a national competition for student authors and won in his age category.
The book's publication in 1987 was included in the award.
The atypical spelling of his first name came from a period of employment in a Pizza Hut, when the "e" was omitted from his nametag.
Even though it is spelled D-A-V, it is pronounced "Dave".
Pilkey took a break from writing for a few years to care for his terminally ill father (who died on November 13, 2008), but in 2010 agreed with Scholastic to publish four new books.
The first two are graphic novels: "The Adventures of Ook and Gluk, Kung-Fu Cavemen From the Future", released on August 10, 2010; and "Super Diaper Baby 2: Invasion of the Potty Snatchers", released on June 28, 2011.
"Captain Underpants and the Terrifying Re-turn of Tippy Tinkletrousers" was released on August 28, 2012 and "Captain Underpants and the Revolting Revenge of the Radioactive Robo-Boxers" was released in January 2013.
