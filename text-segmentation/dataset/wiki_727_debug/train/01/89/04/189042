World Atlantic Airlines is the trading name of Caribbean Sun Airlines, an airline operating on-demand and scheduled charter services.
Its corporate headquarters are located in Suite 450 of Building 845 on the property of Miami International Airport in unincorporated Miami-Dade County, Florida.
========,2,History.
The airline was founded in September 2002 as Caribbean Sun Airlines in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and started operations in January 2003, with flights from San Juan's Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport to Tortola, using Bombardier Dash 8-100 aircraft.
The airline was set up out of necessity to increase the presence of partner company Caribbean Star Airlines.
On January 9, 2007, the airline announced that it would shut down operations by month-end.
The company tried to start up again in March 2008 when it was purchased by Merengue Airlines Dominicana who was led by President/CEO John Russo.
Due to many set backs by the FAA trying to get re-certified, many financial struggles and after several attempts to re-establish the airline's business, the company was sold on January 13, 2009 to an industry group owned by Tomas Romero.
A new airline model was created that included a new branding name: "'World Atlantic Airlines"; industry veteran Joseph A. Fernandez was appointed as President/CEO and Fernandez led the airline and aircraft certification process with the FAA and financial fitness with the DOT.
In August 2010, an application for a new AOC was filed and in September 2010, the FAA issued the AOC, under the leadership of Fernandez.
The name Caribbean Sun Airlines, however, is still the legal name of World Atlantic.
