Tyrrell County was Named for Sir John Tyrrell, one of the Lords Proprietors of the Carolina colony.
Tyrrell County's original boundaries originally stretched westward from "Roanoke Island" to near present-day Tarboro.
In 1870 the territory was divided and resulted in what is now known as Tyrrell, Martin, Washington, and Dare counties.
Elizabethtown, later renamed Columbia, was established on the banks of the Scuppernong River in 1793 and became the Tyrrell County seat in 1799.
Somerset Place State Historic Site, a representative antebellum plantation dating from 1785, is located near Columbia.
Beginning in 1829, this was home to two generations of the Collins family-Josiah Collins III, his wife Mary, and their six sons.
It was also home to more than three hundred enslaved men, women, and children of African descent whose lives and work are interpreted here as well.
Somerset Place offers an insightful view of plantation life during the antebellum period.
