========,2,History.
Wapakoneta was an important site to the Ottawa Native Americans prior to their leaving Ohio.
By 1798, the Shawnee Native Americans had made Wapakoneta their territory and displaced the Ottawa.
By 1808, there were reports of more than five hundred Shawnee, Seneca of the Iroquois, and Mingo Native Americans living at Wapakoneta, including Black Hoof.
The name "Wapakoneta" is derived from Shawnee "Wa·po’kanite" 'Place of White Bones' ("wa·pa" 'white'+"(h)o’kani" 'bone'+-"ite" locative suffix).
The Native Americans of Wapakoneta adopted the agricultural methods that the missionaries from the Society of Friends had introduced to them.
The Native Americans worked to prove that they had indeed adopted the life of the white settlers.
Wapakoneta was the location of the first sawmill and gristmill in northwest Ohio.
In 1810, the United States sent a government agent to help the Native Americans.
This did not last since the federal government removed the agent for failing to submit appropriate paperwork.
The Shawnee and Seneca continued to live at Wapakoneta until the United States forced them to leave in 1831, as part of Indian Removal to lands west of the Mississippi River.
The Treaty of Wapakoneta and the Treaty of Lewistown resulted in the forced removal of the Shawnees and Senecas to lands west of the Mississippi River.
Euro-American settlers quickly replaced the native population.
In 1848, the Ohio legislature created Auglaize County out of parts of Mercer and Allen counties.
Early county voters chose Wapakoneta as the county seat in a disputed contest with rival town Saint Marys.
For the next 150 years, Auglaize County residents primarily were devoted to agriculture, although several additional industries existed in the city by the late nineteenth century.
During the 1880s, an oil and natural gas drilling industry arose.
Wapakoneta's 2,765 residents also claimed to produce more butter churns than any other single location in the United States during this same time period.
In 2000, more than nine thousand people called Wapakoneta home.
Many residents find employment at General Aluminum, Wapakoneta City Schools, Koneta Rubber Co. and companies outside Wapakoneta proper.
It was mentioned in the movie Third Finger, Left Hand as the hometown of character Jeff Thompson, who repeatedly got strange looks when he would say where he was from.
Wapakoneta has seen many business additions in the last several years, including Walmart, Lowes, and local restaurant chain Happy Daz.
