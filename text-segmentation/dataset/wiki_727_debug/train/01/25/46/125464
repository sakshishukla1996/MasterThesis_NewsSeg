========,1,preface.
Colts Neck Township is a township in Monmouth County, New Jersey, United States.
As of the 2010 United States Census, the population was 10,142, reflecting a decline of 2,189 (-17.8%) from the 12,331 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 3,772 (+44.1%) from the 8,559 counted in the 1990 Census.
What is now Colts Neck Township was established by an act of the New Jersey Legislature as Atlantic Township on February 18, 1847, from portions of Freehold Township, Middletown Township and Shrewsbury Township.
The name was changed to "Colts Neck Township" as of November 6, 1962, based on the results of a referendum held that day.
========,2,Community.
Colts Neck is a community in Central New Jersey, located within the New York metropolitan area.
Many people choose to move to Colts Neck due to its open space and proximity to the Jersey Shore, while still being within commuting distance of New York City and, to a lesser extent, Philadelphia.
The township's strict zoning ordinances have long kept out urban development and chain stores, allowing for locally owned businesses, while still being close to malls, movie theaters, and other amenities in neighboring communities.
A 2007 study of New Jersey's wealthiest communities listed Colts Neck as New Jersey's 16th wealthiest municipality and categorized the township's population as "top rung", meaning: These communities are the wealthiest consumer market, representing less than 1 percent of all U.S. households.
These highly educated residents are in their peak earning years, aged 45 to 64, in married-couple households, with or without children.
The median age is 42.3 years.
With the purchasing power to indulge any choice, "Top Rung" residents travel in style, both domestically and overseas.
This is the top market for owning or leasing a luxury car; residents favor new imported vehicles, especially convertibles.
Exercise and community activities are part of their busy lifestyle.
Avid readers, these residents find time to read two or more daily newspapers and countless books.
The township has a Farmland Preservation Committee which to date has preserved nearly of land, providing one way in which Colts Neck has been able to prevent large-scale development.
The township has strict zoning regulations, and because there is no public water or sewage service, most homes must be built on lots covering a minimum of 2, 5 and .
Originally a farming community, Colts Neck has long been known for its large number of equestrian farms.
From the 1950s into the 1970s many of Colts Neck's heavily wooded areas were developed with large colonial and ranch-style houses on acre-sized lots.
In the 1980s and continuing into the 2000s much of the town's farm land has been replaced with large houses, mansions and sprawling estates, although a large number of equestrian farms remain.
During this time period increasing home prices in northern New Jersey and New York City resulted in large numbers of people moving to central New Jersey, causing real estate prices in Colts Neck and surrounding towns to rise considerably over the course of the two decades.
Colts Neck real estate prices remain high despite the economic downturn: as of November 2012, the average listing price of a house was $1,433,112 and the number of home sales is down 41.4% from the previous year.
Many of Colts Neck's residents are professional business people who commute into New York City's financial district, as could be seen in the unusual proportion of the small community who were lost in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks upon the World Trade Center.
A memorial garden dedicated to the five members of the community who were lost was created at the municipal center by sculptor Jim Gary, a member of the community who was raised in Colts Neck.
The central feature of the memorial garden is his sculpture of metal and stained glass.
