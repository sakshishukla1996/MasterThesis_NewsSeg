The Borough Council consists of six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle.
The Borough form of government used by Englishtown, the most common system used in the state, is a "weak mayor / strong council" government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie.
The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council.
The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.
, the Mayor of the Borough of Englishtown is Republican Thomas Reynolds, whose term of office ends December 31, 2019.
Members of the Englishtown Borough Council are Council President Gregory W. Wojyn (R, 2016), Lori Cooke (R, 2018), Maryanne Krawiec (R, 2018), Cindy Robilotti (R, 2017), Eric Mann (R, 2017; appointed to fill an unexpired term) and Lou E. Sarti Jr. (R, 2016).
