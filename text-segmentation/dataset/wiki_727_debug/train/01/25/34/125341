Before European settlement, the land that comprises Flemington, as was all of Hunterdon County, was the territory of the Lenni Lenape Native Americans.
In 1712, as part of a land parcel of , the Flemington area was acquired by William Penn and Daniel Coxe.
The surrounding fertile farmland dictated that the beginnings of Flemington were agricultural.
Early German and English settlers engaged in industries dependent on farm products.
As time passed poultry and dairy farms superseded crops in agricultural importance.
An example of early settlement families was Johann David and Anna Maria Ephland, who emigrated in 1709 from Germany through London to New York and settled on his farm in 1717.
They raised their seven children, and two from his previous marriage, on the farm that now makes up the core of Flemington.
In 1785, Flemington was chosen as the County Seat of Hunterdon.
Fire destroyed the old courthouse in 1826 and the City of Lambertville made an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to have the seat relocated there.
Flemington remained the County Seat and the Courthouse which stands today on Main Street was built.
What is now Flemington was originally formed as a town by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 14, 1870, within portions of Raritan Township.

The borough's incorporation was confirmed on April 27, 1931. the borough was named for Samuel Fleming.
In 1856, the Hunterdon County Agricultural society purchased of land that would accommodate the people, exhibits and livestock for the County (Flemington) Fair.

The fair was held every year at the Flemington Fairgrounds which also was the site of Flemington Fair Speedway (later Flemington Raceway).
