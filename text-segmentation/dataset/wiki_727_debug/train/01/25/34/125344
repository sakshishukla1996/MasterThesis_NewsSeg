========,2,History.
In 1757, three joint owners of a tract purchased from the West Jersey Land Society began laying out streets and building lots at Calvin's Ferry.
The developing town was to be called "Alexandria" in honor of William Alexander, Lord Stirling, one of the three owners.
In 1776, the three sold the settlement to Thomas Lowrey, a Flemington speculator.
In 1794, Lowrey sold the tract to Paul Henri Mallet-Prevost, a Swiss fugitive from the French Revolution.
He and other early settlers were French speaking, leading some to begin calling the place "Frenchtown."
The town grew substantially in the next four decades.
A trade in grain and other farm products developed.
Boatmen and river men helped fuel Frenchtown's growth through their buying of cargo and food, and hiring of pilots.
In the years after Henri Mallet-Prevost's death, his sons sold off portions of their property; no longer was the town privately owned.
