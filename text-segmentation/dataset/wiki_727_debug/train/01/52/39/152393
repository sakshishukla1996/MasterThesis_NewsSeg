========,1,preface.
The bulbuls are a family, Pycnonotidae, of medium-sized passerine songbirds.
Many forest species are known as greenbuls, brownbuls, leafloves, or bristlebills.
The family is distributed across most of Africa and into the Middle East, tropical Asia to Indonesia, and north as far as Japan.
A few insular species occur on the tropical islands of the Indian Ocean There are over 150 species in 27 genera.
While some species are found in most habitats, the African species are predominantly found in rainforest whilst rainforest species are rare in Asia, instead preferring more open areas.
========,2,Taxonomy and systematics.
The traditional layout was to divide the bulbuls into four groups, named "Pycnonotus", "Phyllastrephus", "Criniger", and "Chlorocichla" groups after characteristic genera (Delacour, 1943).
However, more recent analyses demonstrated that this arrangement was probably based on erroneous interpretation of characteristics.
Comparison of mtDNA cytochrome "b" sequences found that five species of "Phyllastrephus" did not belong to the bulbuls, but to an enigmatic group of songbirds from Madagascar instead (Cibois "et al.
", 2001; see below for the species in question), and they are now usually referred to as Malagasy warblers.
Similarly, sequence analysis of the nDNA RAG1 and RAG2 genes suggests that the genus "Nicator" is not a bulbul either (Beresford "et al.
That the previous arrangement had failed to take into account biogeography was indicated by the study of Pasquet "et al."
(2001) who demonstrated the genus "Criniger" must be divided into an African and an Asian ("Alophoixus") lineage.
Using analysis of one nDNA and 2 mtDNA sequences, Moyle & Marks (2006) found one largely Asian lineage and one African group of greenbuls and bristlebills; the golden greenbul seemes to be very distinct and form a group of its own.
Some taxa are not monophyletic, and more research is necessary to determine relationships within the larger genera.
The word "bulbul" derives from , meaning nightingale, but in English, "bulbul" refers to passerine birds of a different family.
========,2,Description.
Bulbuls are short-necked slender passerines.
The tails are long and the wings short and rounded.
In almost all species the bill is slightly elongated and slightly hooked at the end.
They vary in length from 13 cm for the tiny greenbul to 29 cm in the straw-headed bulbul.
Overall the sexes are alike, although the females tend to be slightly smaller.
In a few species the differences are so great that they have been described as functionally different species.
The soft plumage of some species is colorful with yellow, red or orange vents, cheeks, throat or supercilia, but most are drab, with uniform olive-brown to black plumage.
Species with dull coloured eyes often sport contrasting eyerings.
Some have very distinct crests.
Bulbuls are highly vocal, with the calls of most species being described as nasal or gravelly.
One author described the song of the brown-eared bulbul as "the most unattractive noises made by any bird".
========,2,Behaviour and ecology.
========,3,Breeding.
The bulbuls are generally monogamous.
One unusual exception is the yellow-whiskered greenbul which at least over part of its range appears to be polygamous and engage in a lekking system.
Some species also have alloparenting arrangements, where non-breeders, usually the young from earlier clutches, help raise the young of a dominant breeding pair.
Up to five purple-pink eggs are laid in an open tree nests and incubated by the female.
Incubation usually lasts between 11–14 days, and chicks fledge after 12–16 days.
========,3,Feeding.
Bulbuls eat a wide range of different foods, ranging from fruit to seeds, nectar, small insects and other arthropods and even small vertebrates.
The majority of species are frugivorous and supplement their diet with some insects, whilst there is a significant minority of specialists, particularly in Africa.
Open country species in particular are generalists.
Bulbuls in the genus "Criniger" and bristlebills in the genus "Bleda" will join mixed-species feeding flocks.
========,2,Relationship to humans.
The red-whiskered bulbuls and red-vented bulbuls have been captured for the pet trade in great numbers and, has been widely introduced to tropical and subtropical areas, for example southern Florida, Fiji, Australia and Hawaii.
Some species are regarded as crop pests, particularly in orchards.
In general bulbuls and greenbuls are resistant to human pressures on the environment and are tolerant of disturbed habitat.
Around 13 species are considered threatened by human activities, mostly specialised forest species threatened by habitat loss.
