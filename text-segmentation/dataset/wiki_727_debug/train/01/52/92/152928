========,1,preface.
A bluebell wood is a woodland that in springtime has a carpet of flowering bluebells ("Hyacinthoides non-scripta") underneath a newly forming leaf canopy.
The thicker the summer canopy, the more the competitive ground-cover is suppressed, encouraging a dense carpet of bluebells, whose leaves mature and die down by early summer.
Other common woodland plants which accompany bluebells include the yellow rattle and the anemone.
========,2,Locations.
Bluebell woods are found in all parts of Great Britain and Ireland, as well as elsewhere in Europe.
Bluebells are a common indicator species for ancient woodlands, so bluebell woods are likely to date back to at least 1600.
========,2,Literature.
Gerard Manley Hopkins, one of the romantic poets, was very keen on the plant as revealed by these lines of his poem "May Magnificat"
<poem>And azuring-over greybell makes
Wood banks and brakes wash wet like lakes</poem>
In his journal entry for 9 May 1871 Hopkins says:
In the little wood opposite the light they stood in blackish spreads or sheddings like spots on a snake.
The heads are then like thongs and solemn in grain and grape-colour.
But in the clough through the light they come in falls of sky-colour washing the brows and slacks of the ground with vein-blue, thickening at the double, vertical themselves and the young grass and brake-fern combed vertical, but the brake struck the upright of all this with winged transomes.
It was a lovely sight.
- The bluebells in your hand baffle you with their inscape, made to every sense.
If you draw your fingers through them they are lodged and struggle with a shock of wet heads; the long stalks rub and click and flatten to a fan on one another like your fingers themselves would when you passed the palms hard across one another, making a brittle rub and jostle like the noise of a hurdle strained by leaning against; then there is the faint honey smell and in the mouth the sweet gum when you bite them.
