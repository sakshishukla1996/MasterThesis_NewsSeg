========,2,Etymology.
In October 1910, the town of "New Artesia" was to be incorporated.
When the papers were presented in Austin, the men who took them there were told that they would have to change the name since there was already a town in West Texas with that name.
The men returned home, called a town meeting and asked for suggestions.
Not having any luck, the city council members finally authorized their wives to choose a suitable name.
The ladies renamed New Artesia "Christine" after Christine Andrews, the first baby girl born in the town.
She was the daughter of City Marshal James Andrews and wife, Rieta.
The corrected papers were taken back to Austin and Christine was incorporated on October 22, 1910.
