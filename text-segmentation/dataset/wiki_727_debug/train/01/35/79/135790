========,2,History.
The city of Cuero had its start in the mid-19th century as a stopping point on the Chisholm Trail cattle route to Kansas.
However, it was not recognized as a town until 1873, when it was officially founded.
The city was named for the Spanish word meaning "hide", referring to the leather made from animal hides.
The industry was extremely short-lived, however, and gave way to various forms of ranching.
The city had several Old West gunfights related to clan feuding following the Civil War
Cuero's population grew considerably in the 1870s and 1880s, as residents from the coastal town of Indianola, Texas, settled here after major hurricanes in this period destroyed sizeable portions of that city.
Cuero thrived through much of the late 19th and early 20th centuries by the introduction and practice of turkey ranching in the area.
Today, agriculture is still the primary industry in the region.
Cuero is considered to be one of the top cattle producers and shippers in Texas.

The events are the prettiest turkey contest, turkey toss, turkey trot, and turkey race.

In 1972, Charles Kuralt did an "On the Road" Report for CBS News from Cuero, where he did his own turkey call.
"Christmas in Cuero" began in 2000 with the lighting of the gazebo in Cuero Municipal Park.
It has grown to over 100 displays of Victorian and Western scenes, 12-car trains, gingerbread houses, and other scenes.
A live nativity scene is sponsored by a church in Cuero.
Two of the scenes were vandalized by two teens in November 2009.
The park was still open to the public excluding the two damaged scenes.
The teens arrested for the crime had their bonds set at $150,000, in part because of the effect the crime had on the community.
