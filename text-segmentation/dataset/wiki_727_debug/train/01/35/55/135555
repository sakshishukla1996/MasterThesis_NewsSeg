College Station (oftentimes called "CStat" by residents) is home to the main campus of Texas A&M University, the flagship institution of the Texas A&M University System.
The city owes both its name and existence to the university's location along a railroad.
Texas A&M's triple designation as a Land-, Sea-, and Space-Grant institution reflects the broad scope of the research endeavors it brings to the city, with ongoing projects funded by agencies such as NASA, the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Office of Naval Research.
Due largely to the presence of Texas A&M University, College Station was named by "Money" magazine in 2006 as the most educated city in Texas, and the 11th-most educated city in the United States.
========,2,History.
The origins of College Station date from 1860, when the Houston and Texas Central Railway began to build through the region.
Eleven years later, the site was chosen as the location for the proposed Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, a land-grant school.
In 1876, as the nation celebrated its centennial, the school (renamed Texas A&M University in 1963) opened its doors as the first public institution of higher education in the state of Texas.
The population of College Station grew slowly, reaching 350 in 1884 and 391 at the turn of the century.
However, during this time, transportation improvements took place in the town.
In 1900, the I&GN Railroad was extended to College Station (the line was abandoned by the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company in 1965), and 10 years later, electric interurban service was established between Texas A&M and the neighboring town of Bryan.
The interurban was replaced by a city bus system in the 1920s.
In 1930, the community to the north of College Station, known as North Oakwood, was incorporated as part of Bryan.
College Station did not incorporate until 1938 with John H. Binney as the first mayor.
Within a year, the city established a zoning commission, and by 1940, the population had reached 2,184.
The city grew under the leadership of Ernest Langford, called by some the "Father of College Station", who began a 26-year stretch as mayor in 1942.
Early in his first term, the city adopted a council-manager system of city government.
Population growth accelerated following World War II as the nonstudent population reached 7,898 in 1950, 11,396 in 1960, 17,676 in 1970, 30,449 in 1980, 52,456 in 1990, and 67,890 in 2000.
The population for the Bryan-College Station metropolitan area will range from an estimated 250,846 to 271,773 by 2030.
In the 1990s, College Station and Texas A&M University drew national attention when the George Bush Presidential Library opened in 1997 and, more tragically, when 12 people were killed and 27 injured when the Aggie Bonfire collapsed while being constructed in 1999.

Northgate is a mixed-use district north of Texas A&M University that features a combination of businesses, restaurants, apartments, churches, and entertainment.
It is a vibrant part of the city known for its eclectic mix of restaurants and bars.

The district is the home of the Dixie Chicken and of the first Texas location for the regional fast-food chain Freebirds World Burrito.
Northgate's roots started in the 1930s as the city began enjoying rapid population growth from the influx of Texas A&M University students, professors, and their families.
Realizing that proximity to the campus would be a boon for revenues, the first business district was established in College Station near the campus, taking its name for the closest on-campus landmark: the north gate.
When the city was incorporated in 1938, its first City Hall was opened in the new district.
In 1994, restoration efforts began to revitalize the ailing area.
A four-day music festival, "North By Northgate", was introduced in 1998 and has become an annual tradition, renamed the "Northgate Music Festival" in 2002.
In 2006, the city council incorporated Northgate as a special tax zone to finance additional improvements and expansions.
Live music is a major draw to the Northgate area, with venues such as Church Street BBQ and Hurricane Harry's consistently providing evening concerts.
Many well-known musicians, especially in the Texas country music scene, have gotten their starts playing on the porches and stages found in the Northgate area.
