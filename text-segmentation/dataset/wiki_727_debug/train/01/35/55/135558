========,1,preface.
Alpine is a city in and the county seat of Brewster County, Texas, United States.
The population was 5,905 at the 2010 census.
The town has an elevation of 4,475 feet, and the surrounding mountain peaks are over a mile high.
The university, hospital, library, and retail make Alpine the center of the sprawling (12,000 square miles) but wide open Big Bend area (combined population only 12,500) including Brewster, Presidio, and Jeff Davis counties.
========,2,History.
The area had been a campsite for cattlemen tending their herds between 1878 and the spring of 1882, when a town of tents was created by railroad workers and their families.
Because the section of the railroad was called Osborne, that was the name of the small community for a brief time.
The railroad needed access to water from springs owned by brothers named Daniel and Thomas Murphy, so it entered into an agreement with the Murphys to change the name of the section and settlement to Murphyville in exchange for a contract to use the spring.
In November 1883 the Murphys registered a plat for the town of Murphyville with the county clerk of Presidio County.
The town's name was changed to Alpine on February 3, 1888, following a petition by its residents.
At this time a description of the town mentioned a dozen houses, three saloons, a hotel and rooming house, a livery stable, a butcher shop, and a drugstore, which also housed the post office.
Alpine grew very slowly until Sul Ross State Normal College (now Sul Ross State University) was opened in 1920.
The development of Big Bend National Park in the 1930s and 40s spurred further growth.
The population was estimated at only 396 in 1904, but by 1927 it had risen to 3,000.
The 1950 census reported Alpine's population at 5,256, and a high of approximately 6,200 was reached by 1976.
In 1990 the population was down to 5,637.
In 2000 the population grew modestly to 5,786 and 5,905 by 2010.
The town was always small enough that no one insisted on tearing down old buildings to make parking lots, and it is still too small to interest most big box store chains.
The Holland Hotel, built during a brief mercury mining boom, was designed by Henry Trost, a distinguished regional architect.
Today it helps to anchor a traditional downtown of early 20th-Century buildings still occupied by family-owned retailers and restaurants.
========,2,Geography.
The town sits on a high plateau, in the Chihuahua Desert, with the Davis Mountains to the north and the Chisos Mountains to the south.
Outcrops of ancient volcanic rocks spread to the northwest.
Other layers of rocks have been exposed over time as the mountains were forced up and then eroded.
The high elevation cools the desert air in the evenings.
Alpine is located on U.S. Route 90 about east of Marfa and 31 miles west of Marathon.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.
========,2,Climate.
In the winters, ample sunshine usually warms the days, though the nights can be chilly due to the elevation.
In the summer, the fierce sun causes hot days, pleasantly relieved in the evening by the same high elevation.
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Alpine has a semi-arid climate, abbreviated "BSk" on climate maps.

A mural in the former Post Office at 109 West E St was painted as part of the New Deal make-work programs during the Great Depression.
Surviving murals from the project are found in 60 or so Texas cities and towns.
Completed in 1940, this mural is by a Spanish-born and trained artist, Jose Moya del Pino, who was living and working in San Francisco.
In the foreground, three figures recline on a rocky overlook (somewhat improbably, but this is art, not photography).
They are each reading: a book, a magazine, and a tabloid newspaper, celebrating how the Post Office brings information and education to small towns and even cattle ranches.
On the horizon, the Twin Sisters peaks mark the location, with the town in the middle distance, including, at the behest of townspeople, the characteristic red brick buildings of the Sul Ross State campus.
