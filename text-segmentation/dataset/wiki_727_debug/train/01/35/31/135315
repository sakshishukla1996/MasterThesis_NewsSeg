========,2,History.
South Fulton was first known as Jacksonvile, and was named aptly so since land in the area once belonged to Andrew Jackson.
It is recorded that Andrew Jackson sold in northeast Weakley County in 1823.
Jacksonville existed from about 1859 until 1895 when South Fulton was first chartered.
========,2,"Pay for Spray" controversy.
Starting in the early 1990s, South Fulton adopted a policy of allowing people outside the city limits to be protected by the fire department, in return for a $75 annual fee.
But unlike neighboring towns, which would even protect someone who had not paid (while charging them a larger fee covering expenses), South Fulton would simply refuse to help anyone not on a list as having paid up.
In 2010, a member of the Cranick family of Obion County was burning trash near the family home, when it got out of control and caught the house on fire.
They called 911, but the fire department refused to respond, because the Cranicks weren't on the list as having paid the tax.
Understanding the premise of the free rider problem, Gene Cranick offered to pay the full cost of the department responding, but was refused.
The South Fulton Fire Department did show up, but refrained from helping, only protecting the property of a neighbor who had paid the tax.
The Cranicks lost three dogs and the family cat, along with the house and most of their possessions.
In 2011 this happened again, with Vicky Bell, the homeowner, reporting that the fire department actually pulled up and watched, but did not help.
This policy has been decried by media nationally, including Keith Olbermann, and Harold Schaitberger, president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, who said "Professional, career firefighters shouldn’t be forced to check a list before running out the door to see which homeowners have paid up...They get in their trucks and go."
Conversely, this policy was defended by some, including Glenn Beck and the National Review Two years after this controversy started, the city of South Fulton changed their policy.
Going forward, any homeowner who didn't pay the $75 tax must pay $3,500 per call.
