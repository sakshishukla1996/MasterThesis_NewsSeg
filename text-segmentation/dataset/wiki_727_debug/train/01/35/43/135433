========,2,Economic development.
Andrews is a city built on oil and soil.
After the first oil well was drilled (1929) by Deep Rock Oil Company on Missourian Charles E. Ogden's property Andrews County became one of the major oil producing counties in the State of Texas, having produced in excess of of oil.
However, the cyclical nature of the oil business (as well as diminishing production on existing wells), has caused the community to look into new means of economic development, such as waste disposal, which in some areas has caused controversy.
Waste Control Specialists (WCS), owned by Harold Simmons and headquartered in Dallas, Texas, operates a site in Andrews County on the border with New Mexico.
The company was awarded a license to dispose of radioactive waste by the TCEQ in 2009.
The permit allows for disposal of radioactive materials such as uranium, plutonium and thorium from commercial power plants, academic institutions and medical schools.
The company finished construction on the project in 2011 and started disposing of waste in 2012.
There are two radioactive waste landfills at the site.
The 30-acre compact site is owned and regulated by the State of Texas for use by Texas, Vermont, and up to 36 other states.
The 90-acre federal site is owned by the United States federal government and is used for Department of Energy and other federal waste.
The company employs 130 people or about 1% of the total labor force in Andrews.
For years there has been a simmering dispute over which state these waste sites are lawfully a part of: Texas or New Mexico?
The straight north-south border between the two states was originally defined as the 103rd meridian, but the 1859 survey that was supposed to mark that boundary mistakenly set the border between 2.29 and 3.77 miles too far west of that line, making the waste sites, along with the current towns of Farwell, Texline, and part of Glenrio, appear to be within the State of Texas.
New Mexico's short border with Oklahoma, in contrast, was surveyed on the correct meridian.
New Mexico's draft constitution in 1910 stated that the border is on the 103rd meridian as intended.
The disputed strip, hundreds of miles long, includes parts of valuable oilfields of the Permian Basin.
A bill was passed in the New Mexico Senate to fund and file a lawsuit in the U.S. Supreme Court to recover the strip from Texas, but the bill did not become law.
Today, land in the strip is included in Texas land surveys and the waste sites for all purposes are taxed and governed by The State of Texas.
The city was set to be the location of the now defunct $400 million HT3R project.
In 1972, Andrews became the site of the first Kirby Company vacuum cleaner factory outside of the original location in Ohio.
It is often referred to as "Kirby West" to signify the westward expansion of the country.
The company employs about 200 people.
In 2011 the city opened Business Park South to provide more incentive options for attracting businesses.
Energy Business Park was also opened by the city in 2014.
The city completed more than $3 million in airport renovations.
Voters approved bonds to construct a new $13 million loop around town which opened in October 2013.
A brand new $2 million fire station opened at the end of 2013.
A new $60 million hospital is also planned to open in 2015.
The town began to sell alcohol for the first time on December 19, 2013.

The high school started issuing laptop computers to each student in 2012.
The elementary and middle school campuses also began to issue iPad tablets to all students.
Students are allowed to take the devices home, but must return them at the end of the school year.
Due to increased enrollments several construction projects began construction in 2013.
