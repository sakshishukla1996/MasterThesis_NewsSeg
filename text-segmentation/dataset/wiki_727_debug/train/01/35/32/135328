In the 1880s, the Nashville & Knoxville Railroad erected a depot at what is now Algood.
The land on which the depot was built was purchased from a circuit rider and early settler named Joel Algood, and thus the train stop was named after him.

In 1899, the Algood Methodist Church (now Algood United Methodist Church) was built on land donated by the children of this early settler.
