========,2,The I B & W Railroad.
Modoc, like many other small towns, probably would not have been built if the I.
& W. Railroad had not made its way across southern Randolph County, in 1878.
The location was poorly drained, but it had the advantage of being rather flat.
It was plagued, for many years, by typhoid fever outbreaks.
The railroad was built by many contractors.
The railroad came through Modoc from the west, and met the contractors, who were building the next section east, in what was then a strip of timber about one-half mile east of where the depot was located.
