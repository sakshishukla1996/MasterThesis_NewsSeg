========,2,PennEast Pipeline.
The Kidder Township Supervisors passed a resolution opposing the PennEast pipeline.
The proposed PennEast Pipeline will pass through the county adversely impacting many property owners and community tax revenues.
Unlike other states, under Pennsylvania state tax policy, natural gas and oil pipelines are exempted from property taxes.
Pipeline companies prohibit development within the 100 foot wide right-of-way, there by limiting future development options for the landowner.
This limits future potential property tax revenues for the school district, by constraining future land development.
Located in the marcellus shale region, Carbon County is adversely impacted this way.
The Carbon County Planning Commission and Carbon County Commissioners have stated opposition to the pipeline project.
The pipeline adversely impacts: Penn Forest Township, Kidder Township, Towamensing Township and Lower Towamensing Township.
The Township Supervisors in all four townships passed resolutions opposing the pipeline.
The pipeline's impact on property tax revenues will also adversely impact the school district by depressing revenues.
