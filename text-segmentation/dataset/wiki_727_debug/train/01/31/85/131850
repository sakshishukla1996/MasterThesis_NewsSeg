========,2,History.
In 1682, William Penn deeded 50,000 acres in what is now Londonderry Township to his relative John Fagg.
It eventually developed into the crossroads community of Faggs Manor, Pennsylvania.
Londonderry Township was officially created in 1734 when its Scotch-Irish immigrant residents voted to secede from Nottingham Township.
It is named after the city of Londonderry, Ireland which is in present-day Northern Ireland.
The township was profiled in Witold Rybczynski's 2007 book "".
He divided the population into four types: farmers, who made up only 10 percent of the population; large wealthy landowners, who make up another 10 percent and often raise horses; old suburbanites; and new suburbanites.
The old suburbanites and new suburbanites have little in common but both oppose new development in the township.
The John Ferron House, Moses Ross House, and St. Malachi Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
