========,2,History.
The municipality has been inhabited for a long time, but without any significant urban areas.
At the turn of the 19th century it contained some 700 inhabitants.
By 1949 it was eligible to receive rights as a "köping", comparable to town rights.
A coat of arms was designed for the occasion, traditionally used by the cities of Sweden.
When the municipal reform was carried out in the 1970s, Gislaved adapted the still unused coat of arms as the municipal arms.
The arms depict the insignia for a historical hostel nearby.
There are 19 churches in the municipality, the oldest from 1350.
In the small town of Burseryd is a church bell that is even older.
Its inscription was made with the Futhark alphabet and reads in translation "The year Anno Domine 1238 was this bell made.
Bero wrote the inscription".
It is today the second oldest church bell in Sweden.
