The much smaller Scottish force rode through the night from Biggar, intercepted them and defeated them in two, possibly three, sharp fights.
The site of the battle has been said to be the field opposite the old and new burial grounds.
Members of the Comyn, Fraser and possibly Sinclair families fought at the Battle of Roslin.
