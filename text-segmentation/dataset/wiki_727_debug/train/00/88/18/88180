========,1,preface.
Tuvok is one of the main characters on the television series "".
Tuvok is a member of the fictional Vulcan species who serves as the ship's Chief of Security and Chief Tactical Officer.
Tim Russ portrayed Tuvok throughout the show's run, from 1995 to 2001.
The character is not only second officer for the entire series, he is a critical plot point for the show.
As revealed in the Voyager launch show "Caretaker", he is working as an undercover Federation agent in a Maquis group as a member of Chakotay's cell and serving aboard the Maquis Raider-class ship the "Val Jean".
His recovery is the actual mission Voyager is sent on, a mission that is completed by Janeway at the cost of about one-third of her crew and seven years in space.
The recovery of Tuvok is also a reason Janeway recruits Tom Paris from Federation prison, to aid in finding the Maqui cell Tuvok was a part of (Paris also becomes a main character in Voyager during the show's run).
The Star Trek: Voyager is based on Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek, and science fiction lore created for Vulcans is extended including the classic Vulcan pointy ears, mind-melds, and logic versus emotion struggles.
Vulcan is the species of the character Spock, who appeared in multiple television shows and feature films of the Star Trek franchise over several decades.
========,2,Overview.
Over the course of seven season of Voyager Tuvok's character and back-story are revealed.
Tuvok is working as a Federation spy aboard the Maquis raider "Val Jean", and he is also Voyager's second officer.
As portrayed in the Voyager pilot "Caretaker", the mission of Voyager is retrieve him after that ship goes missing by Deep Space Nine space station.
This follows on from a narrative established in the scifi Star Trek universe by Star Trek : Deep Space Nine, which was in mid-series at the start of Voyager as well as Star Trek: The Next Generation, which had concluded its last season in the spring of 1995 before Voyager started.
Voyager does retrieve Tuvok, but only because it was abducted to the delta quadrant by an extra-galactic alien known as the Caretaker.
In the course of the Voyager launch featurette, the crews are used for medical experiments by the Caretaker, the Val Jean is destroyed, and a number of people are killed including many important positions on Voyager.
Tuvok re-joins the crew and the former Maquis are taken aboard Voyager as they try to make their way back to Earth.
However, the warp drive is too slow, it will take decades to back to Earth because they are on other side of the Galaxy.
Tuvok will be instrumental in many episodes as a fully trained Starfleet officer and with many talents like the Vulcan Mind meld.
In the last season it is revealed that Tuvok was discovered by a Maquis leader who tortured him and altered his memories of this event leading to dramatic events in one episode.
Because he is married with a family (a family he separated from as they are in the Delta quadrant) a number of episodes refer to this back-story.
Tuvok is very old in Voyager, over 100 years In the episode "Unimatrix Zero", the Tuvok character states that he was born on stardate 38774 (equivalent to the year 2264) on Vulcanis, a lunar colony belonging to the Vulcan people.
As a teenager, portrayed in flashback sequences during " by LeRoy D. Brazile, Tuvok is revealed to have fallen in love with Jara, daughter to a diplomat of the alien species called Terrelians.
When Jara did not return his affections, Tuvok's jealousy caused him to be expelled from school and resulted in his parents sending him to the Vulcan master (Joseph Ruskin) to learn emotional control.
Tuvok attended Starfleet Academy in San Francisco.
Upon graduation, he was commissioned an ensign at age 29, serving as a junior science officer on the USS Excelsior, under Captain Hikaru Sulu (seen in the episode ").
During his early service with Starfleet, Tuvok became increasingly uncomfortable associating with non-Vulcans, and he resigned his Starfleet commission in 2298 to pursue his people's Kolinahr regimen of true non-emotion.
He went into pon farr six years later, leading to his marriage to T'Pel, and began a family.
Fifty years later, after much self-examination, Tuvok rejoined Starfleet as a training instructor at Starfleet Academy.
His return to Starfleet was marked by a maturity and a reconsideration of the benefits service provided.
After a few years teaching cadets, Tuvok was briefly assigned to the USS "Billings" with Kathryn Janeway, until both Janeway and Tuvok were assigned to the USS "Wyoming" and then the Intrepid-class starship USS "Voyager", as Captain (Janeway) and Security & Tactical Officer (Tuvok).
In 2371, Tuvok was assigned to infiltrate the Maquis organization aboard Chakotay's vessel.
In the last season, episode four, , introduced the premise that during the infiltration mission, Tuvok's identity was uncovered by a Maquis counter-intelligence agent, Teero Anaydis (Keith Szarabajka), who used Tuvok as a laboratory specimen for mind-control experiments.
Although Tuvok was conscious throughout the experiments, Teero wiped his memory when he had finished, ensuring that Tuvok was unable to remember any details.
Following the ordeal, Tuvok was released back among the Maquis.
This "time-bomb" was activated by a message hidden in a letter from Tuvok's son that caused the events seven years later in the Voyager timeline.
During an incident involving the Maquis ship and the USS "Voyager", both vessels were unwillingly transported to the Delta Quadrant by the enigmatic .
When the Maquis ship was destroyed by crashing into a Kazon ship to save the USS "Voyager", Tuvok was transported off the ship with a handful of other survivors, and resumed his duties as Security and Tactical Officer.
At that time, Voyager also picked up two Delta Quadrant natives, Neelix, a Talaxian, and his partner Kes, from Ocampa.
Tuvok recognized Kes' psionic abilities and helped her develop them.
Tuvok learned to tolerate Neelix's overly friendly and emotional behavior.
Later, a transporter accident fused Tuvok and Neelix together into a new humanoid appropriately named "Tuvix".
They were eventually restored to their individual forms under the orders of Captain Janeway, using a procedure devised by the EMH and Operations Officer Harry Kim.
Tuvok still had issues with Neelix after the experience and many of them are raised again in the episode ".
The two eventually became friends, though it was more apparent from Neelix's end.
At the opening of the fourth season episode ", relatively dated 2374, Tuvok was promoted to the rank of lieutenant commander.
Before this in most of the 1st season he is frequently referred to as "lieutenant", even though he wears lieutenant commander rank insignia.
It is learned during "Endgame", the final episode of the series, that Tuvok suffers from a degenerative neurological disease, which can only be cured by undergoing a mind-meld with a family member.
In 2377, he was still well enough to perform his duties.
However, in his elderly years, in an alternate timeline, the disease finally ravaged Tuvok's mind as he was not able to return to the Alpha Quadrant in time for a cure.
This left him confined to a mental hospital.
However, to save Tuvok among others, Captain Janeway's future-self changed history, by finding a way to return the "Voyager" crew to the Alpha Quadrant back in 2378, the time before his disease worsened.
(In the novelization of "Endgame", Tuvok's eldest son Sek arrives aboard "Voyager" and performs the required mind meld, curing Tuvok.)
========,2,After Voyager.
In the non-canon "" novel series, Tuvok joins William Riker on the USS "Titan" as tactical officer, leaving "Voyager".
His wife joins him.
In 2008 Tim Russ brought back Tuvok in the fan film project, "" joining a cast of several "Star Trek" actors from various series'.
In 2015 Tim Russ again reprised the role of Tuvok in the fan series, "" as head of Section 31 alongside Walter Koenig portraying the "ST:TOS" character of Pavel Chekov.
In the Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game Star Trek Online, Tim Russ provides voice acting for the character of Tuvok, who plays a major role in the Undine quest line.
In the quest line, Tuvok has been promoted to Admiral, and is in command of USS Voyager.
========,2,Personality.
A full Vulcan, Tuvok has a complex personality, with internal conflict.
Despite his undergoing the Kolinahr, there is a fair amount of evidence to suggest that he never entirely gained emotional control, and he feels bitterness over his Vulcan heritage.
He is also shown to exhibit subdued moments of annoyance, self-doubt, sarcasm and even anger (mostly directed towards Neelix, whose gregarious personality is often at odds with Tuvok's Vulcan stoicism).
Despite this internal conflict, he is shown on numerous occasions to be capable of great nobility and altruism.
In several occasions Tuvok is the victim of mind-altering events, medical torture, or other trauma.
At one point he is also combined with Neelix, producing the person known as Tuvix.
One traumatic life event is described in "Repression", the Maquis terrorist Teero discovers Tuvok and conducts brain-washing and wipes his memory.
In "Workforce" he is brain washed and has his memories altered, and he is altered in "Riddle" also.
In each case he recovers, however, by "Endgame" he, perhaps unsurprisingly, has a neurological disease.
Examples of traumatic events for the character:
***LIST***.
========,2,Relationships.
T'Pel is the wife of Tuvok.
They married in 2304.
They have three sons and one daughter named Asil.
T'Pel is featured in the "Voyager" episodes " and ", both times when Tuvok is hallucinating, and a holographic version of her is featured in "".
She is played by actress Marva Hicks.
His son Sek is played by Ronald Robison and is seen for example in a video message from Earth in "Repression" (S7E4).
========,2,Mind Melds.
Tuvok conducts the Vulcan Mind Meld with many characters in Voyager.
In one unique case he mind-melds two other characters, Janeway and Seven of Nine in episode "Unimatrix Zero".
Over the course of the series he Mind-Melds with almost the entire bridge crew on different occasions, as well as a variety of aliens.
Mind Melds have been a common fixture in the Star Trek science fiction universe since the original Star Trek, where it was depicted by the half-Vulcan/human Spock.
There are appears to be different levels of mind melds, and more limited ones carry less risk.
The first mind meld was in Dagger of the Mind (S1E9) debuting in November 1966 in the classic series "TOS".
Examples of meldings:
***LIST***.
Not all mind-melds appear consensual, for example the Tuvok-Chakotay Mind Meld in "Repression" is shown being done after a struggle and it puts Chakotay into coma for many hours (on-screen), and the second time is also involuntary.
He also forcibly mind-melds with many former Maquis, putting them in temporary comas (off-screen).
In "Think Tank" Tuvok attempts a mind-meld apparently as an interrogation technique but it is not stated if it is consensual; he does describe the prisoners as "unusually resistant" to Mind Meld, and Janeway instructs him to "hold off on the torture".
In the episode "Critical Care" (S7E5) he threatens a prisoner with mind meld.
========,2,Mirror Universe.
The Mirror Tuvok appears in the " third season episode " as a member of the Terran Rebellion.
He is the only "Voyager" character whose Mirror counterpart appears onscreen.
========,2,Star Trek franchise.
The actor who plays Tuvok in Voyager, Timothy Russ, has had various involvements with the Star Trek franchise, including auditoning for TNG's Geordi in the 1980s.
He appears as a terrorist in Star Trek: The Next Generation "Starship Mine" and he went on to direct some Star Trek episodes.
One interesting possibility raised by (S2E3) is that Voyager was a simulation in holodeck on Jupiter Station, which provides one way of explaining certain aspects of Voyager;existing Alpha quadrant knowledge was extrapolated for the simulation such as Kazon from the Klingons, Paris from Locarno, and finally Tuvok from the terrorist in Starship Mine.
However, since Tuvok was playing an undercover agent for Maquis, its possible that he was a commemoration of an unknown officer that had infiltrated group in "Starship Mine".
