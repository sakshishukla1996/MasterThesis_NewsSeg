========,2,Early life.
Sheen was born in Dayton, Ohio, the son of Mary-Ann (née Phelan; 1903–1951) and Francisco Estévez Martínez (1898–1974).
During birth, Sheen's left arm was crushed by forceps, giving him limited lateral movement of that arm, which is shorter than his right (Erb's palsy).
Both of Sheen's parents were immigrants; his mother from Borrisokane, County Tipperary, Ireland; and his father was born in Salceda de Caselas, Galicia, Spain.
After moving to Dayton in the 1930s, his father was a factory worker/machinery inspector at the National Cash Register Company.
Sheen grew up on Brown Street in the South Park neighborhood, one of ten children (nine boys and a girl).
Due to his father's work, the family lived in Bermuda on St. John's Road, Pembroke, where five of his brothers were born.
Martin was the first child to be born in Dayton, Ohio, after the family returned from Bermuda.
Sheen contracted polio as a child and had to remain bedridden for a year.
His doctor's treatment using Sister Kenny's method helped him regain use of his legs.
When he was eleven years old, Sheen's mother died, and the children faced the possibility of living in an orphanage or foster homes.
The family was able to remain together with the assistance of Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Dayton.
Raised as a Catholic, he graduated from Chaminade High School (now Chaminade Julienne Catholic High School).
At fourteen years, he organized a strike of golf caddies while working at a private golf club in Dayton, Ohio.
He complained about the golfers: "They often used obscene language in front of us... we were little boys and they were abusive... anti-Semitic... And they, for the most part, were upstanding members of the community."
Sheen was drawn to acting at a young age, but his father disapproved of his interest in the field.
Despite his father's opposition, Sheen borrowed money from a Catholic priest and moved to New York City in his early twenties, hoping to make it as an actor.
He spent two years in the Living Theatre company.
It was in New York that he met the legendary Catholic activist Dorothy Day.
Working with her Catholic Worker Movement, he began his commitment to social justice, and would one day go on to play Peter Maurin, cofounder of the Catholic Worker Movement, in "".
Sheen deliberately failed the entrance examination for the University of Dayton so that he could pursue his acting career.
He adopted his stage name, Martin Sheen, from a combination of the CBS casting director, Robert Dale Martin, who gave him his first big break, and the televangelist archbishop, Fulton J. Sheen.
In a 2003 "Inside the Actors Studio" interview, Sheen explained, Whenever I would call for an appointment, whether it was a job or an apartment, and I would give my name, there was always that hesitation and when I'd get there, it was always gone.
So I thought, I got enough problems trying to get an acting job, so I invented Martin Sheen.
It's still Estevez officially.
I never changed it officially.
I never will.
It's on my driver's license and passport and everything.
I started using Sheen, I thought I'd give it a try, and before I knew it, I started making a living with it and then it was too late.
In fact, one of my great regrets is that I didn't keep my name as it was given to me.
I knew it bothered my dad.
========,2,Career.
Sheen was greatly influenced by the actor James Dean.
He developed a theatre company with other actors in hopes that a production would earn him recognition.
In 1963, he made an appearance in "Nightmare", an episode of the television science fiction series "The Outer Limits".
In 1964, he co-starred in the Broadway play "The Subject Was Roses"; he later reprised his role in the 1968 film of the same name, and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor.

(1968), "" (1969), "Hawaii Five-O" (1970), "Dan August" (1971), "The Rookies" (1973), "Columbo" (1973), and "The Streets of San Francisco" (1973).

Filming in the Philippine jungle in the typhoon season of 1976, Sheen admitted he was not in great shape and was drinking heavily.

Twelve months into filming, Sheen suffered a minor heart attack and he had to crawl out to a road for help.
While recovering, his younger brother Joe Estevez stood in for him in a number of long shots and in some of the voice-overs.

========,3,Academic pursuits.
After the end of filming of "The West Wing," Sheen announced plans to further his education: "My plan is to read English literature, philosophy and theology in Galway, Ireland, where my late mother came from and where I'm also a citizen."
Speaking after an honorary arts doctorate was conferred on him by the National University of Ireland, Sheen joked that he would be the "oldest undergraduate" at the National University of Ireland (NUI), Galway, when he started his full-time studies there in the autumn of 2006.
Although expressing concern that he might be a "distraction" to other students at NUIG, he attended lectures like everyone else.
Speaking the week after filming his last episode of "The West Wing," he said, "I'm very serious about it."
He once said, "I never went to college when I was young and am looking forward to giving it a try... at age 65!"

He is a supporter of the Catholic Worker movement.
Despite being a Catholic, he supports same-sex marriage although the Catholic Church does not.
========,3,Family life and abortion stance.
In a 2011 interview with RTÉ, Sheen stated that his wife was conceived through rape, and had her mother aborted her, or dumped her in the Ohio River as she had considered, his wife would not exist.
He also disclosed that three of his grandchildren were conceived out of wedlock, saying his sons "were not happy at the time but they came to love these children.
We have three grown grandchildren, two of them are married, they're some of the greatest source [sic] of joy in our lives."
He has also stated his empathy for women facing unexpected pregnancy, and that he didn't oppose their right to abortion: I cannot make a choice for a woman, particularly a black or brown or poor pregnant woman.
I would not make a judgment in the case.
As a father and a grandfather, I have had experience with children who don't always come when they are planned, and I have experienced the great joy of God's presence in my children, so I'm inclined to be against abortion of any life.
But I am equally against the death penalty or war – anywhere people are sacrificed for some end justifying a means.
I don't think abortion is a good idea.
I personally am opposed to abortion, but I will not judge anybody else's right in that regard because I am not a woman and I could never face the actual reality of it.
In a 2011 interview given to Catholic World Report he said that he considered himself to be pro-life: It’s a matter of record with me.
It’s a part of my faith.
I’m a father, you know.
When three of our grandchildren were young, a long time ago—I became a grandfather at age 42—and we didn’t have any in-laws, we supported these children who had come into our lives.
We didn’t consider them any less welcome or ourselves any less blessed.
That’s who we are.
We know what a child can bring, no matter the circumstances.
So [being pro-life] is both natural for us and a practical acceptance.
My wife is not Catholic, but she is very pro-life.
She’s a mother and a grandmother.
She knows what it means.
There’s just never any question—ever.
========,2,Awards and honors.
In the spring of 1989, Sheen was named honorary mayor of Malibu, California.
He promptly marked his appointment with a decree proclaiming the area "a nuclear-free zone, a sanctuary for aliens and the homeless, and a protected environment for all life, wild and tame".
Some local citizens were angered by the decree, and the Malibu Chamber of Commerce met in June of that year to consider revoking his title, but voted unanimously to retain him.
