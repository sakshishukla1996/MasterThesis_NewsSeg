Teruel () is a town in Aragon, located in eastern Spain, and is also the capital of Teruel Province.
It has a population of 35,675 in 2014 making it the least populated provincial capital in the country.
It is noted for its harsh climate (hot in summer and very cold in winter), its renowned "jamón serrano" (cured ham), its pottery, its surrounding archaeological sites, rock outcrops containing some of the oldest dinosaur remains of the Iberian Peninsula, and its famous events: "" during the weekend closer more to the 10th July (Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday), and "Bodas de Isabel de Segura" around the third weekend of February.
Teruel is regarded as the "town of mudéjar" (Moorish-influenced architecture) due to numerous buildings designed in this style.
All of them are comprised in the Mudéjar Architecture of Aragon which is a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO.
Teruel's remote and mountainous location above sea level and its low population has led to relative isolation within Spain.
A campaign group with the slogan "Teruel existe" ("Teruel exists") was founded in 1999 to press for greater recognition and investment in the town and the province.
Due in part to the campaign, transport connections to Teruel are being greatly improved with the construction of a motorway between Zaragoza and Sagunto, large parts of which are now open.
However, Teruel remains the only provincial capital in peninsular Spain without a direct railway link to the capital, Madrid.
