Tourism in Bulgaria is a significant contributor to the country's economy.
Situated at the crossroads of the East and West, Bulgaria has been home to many civilizations - Thracians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Slavs, Bulgars, and Ottomans.
The country is rich in tourist sights and historical artifacts, scattered through a relatively small and easily accessible territory.
Bulgaria is internationally known for its seaside and winter resorts.
In 2016, Bulgaria was visited by approximately 13.6 million people from abroad.
Tourists from five countries - Greece, Romania, Turkey, Germany, and Russia - account for approximately 50% of all visitors.
The sector contributed to 15% of GDP and supported 150 000 workplaces in 2014.

The Bulgarian town house is an embodiment of the owner's social status, craft and traditions.
Many old buildings that demonstrate this type of architecture—e.g.
in the villages of Arbanasi, Leshten, Kovachevitsa, Melnik—have been preserved to the present day.

========,4,Seaside resorts.
The Bulgarian Black Sea Coast is picturesque and diverse.
White and golden sandy beaches occupy approximately 130 km of the 378 km long coast.
The temperatures during the summer months are very suitable for marine tourism and the water temperature allows sea bathing from May to October.
Prior to 1989 the Bulgarian Black Sea coast was internationally known as the Red Riviera.
Since the fall of the Iron Curtain, however, its nickname has been changed to the Bulgarian Riviera.
