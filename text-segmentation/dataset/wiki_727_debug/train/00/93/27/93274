========,2,Politics, law and government.
Nash County was originally a typically overwhelmingly Democratic “Solid South” county with a large and completely disfranchised black population.
Although it gave a plurality to Populist candidate James B. Weaver in 1892, it did not like Sampson County or Alabama’s Chilton County subsequently turn to the Republican Party.
Nash County would vote Democratic in every election from 1896 to 1964 – in Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman’s five elections the Republicans never received eleven percent of the county’s limited electorate’s ballots – before supporting George Wallace’s American Independent candidacy in 1968, and voting Republican for the first time in 1972.
After turning like most Wallace counties to Southern Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1976, Nash would become solidly Republican from 1980 to 2004 before turning into one of the nation’s most closely contested counties in the past three elections.
Mitt Romney became the first Republican to lose the county since Gerald Ford, but Donald Trump narrowly reclaimed Nash in 2016.
Nash County is a member of the regional Upper Coastal Plain Council of Governments.
