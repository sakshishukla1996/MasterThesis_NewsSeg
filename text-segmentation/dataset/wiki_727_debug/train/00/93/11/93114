========,2,History.
Most of Hamilton County was originally owned and surveyed by John Cleves Symmes, and the region was a part of the Symmes Purchase.
The first settlers rafted down the Ohio River in 1788 following the American Revolutionary War.
They established the towns of Losantiville (later Cincinnati) and Cleves.
Hamilton County was organized in 1790, as the second county in the Northwest Territory.
Its area then included about one-eighth of Ohio, and had about 2,000 inhabitants (not including the remaining Native Americans).
The United States persuaded most of the Shawnee and other Indian peoples to remove in the 1820s to locations west of the Mississippi River.
Since then, other counties were created from Hamilton, reducing the county to its present size.
Rapid growth occurred during the 1830s and 1840s as the area attracted many German and Irish immigrants, especially after the Great Famine in Ireland and the revolutions in Germany in 1848.
During the Civil War, Morgan's Raid (a Confederate cavalry campaign from Kentucky) passed through the northern part of the county during the summer of 1863.
