========,1,preface.
The London Borough of Islington is a London borough in Inner London with an estimated population of 215,667.
It was formed in 1965 by merging the former metropolitan boroughs of Islington and Finsbury, but the merged entity remains the second smallest borough in London and the third smallest district in England.
The borough contains two Westminster parliamentary constituencies, Islington North and Islington South & Finsbury.
The local authority is Islington Council.
The borough is home to football club Arsenal, one of the most successful clubs in England and its home Emirates Stadium that is one of the largest football stadiums in the country.
========,2,Etymology.
Islington was originally named by the Saxons "Giseldone" (1005), then "Gislandune" (1062).
The name means 'Gīsla's hill' from the Old English personal name Gīsla and "dun" 'hill', 'down'.
The name then later mutated to "Isledon", which remained in use well into the 17th century when the modern form arose.
In medieval times, Islington was just one of many small manors in the area, along with "Bernersbury", "Neweton Berewe" or "Hey-bury", and "Canonesbury" (Barnsbury, Highbury and Canonbury - names first recorded in the 13th and 14th centuries).
"Islington" came to be applied as the name for the parish covering these villages, and was the name chosen for the Metropolitan Borough of Islington, on its formation in 1899.
On the merger with Finsbury, to form the modern borough this name came to be applied to the whole borough.
========,2,Government and infrastructure.
Islington Council is the borough's local authority.
It is a London borough council, one of thirty-two principal subdivisions of the administrative area of Greater London.

========,2,Demographics.
In 1801, the civil parishes that form the modern borough had a total population of 65,721.

When the railways arrived the rate of population growth increased—reaching nearly 400,000 by the turn of the century; with the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury particularly suffering deprivation, poverty and severe overcrowding.
The increase in population peaked before World War I, falling slowly in the aftermath until World War II began an exodus from London towards the new towns under the Abercrombie Plan for London (1944).
