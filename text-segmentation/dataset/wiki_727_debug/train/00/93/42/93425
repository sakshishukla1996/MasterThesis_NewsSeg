========,3,Potential rail-to-trails.
Union County Park Line rail trail is a proposed walking and/or biking trail proposed on old railroad tracks.
Two abandoned rails exist in the county.
The City of Summit and the Summit Park Line Foundation are working on turning the line from Morris Avenue to Briant Park in Summit into a rail trail that will be approximately one mile long.
This rail trail, potentially called the Summit Park Line, could provide a greenway to connect several county parks, akin to a Summit High Line.
A path could run directly from Summit to the Arthur Kill in Linden, New Jersey on the Rahway Valley Railroad and the Staten Island Rapid Transit line.
The Summit city council applied for a $1 million grant toward the Summit Park Line project in November 2016.
“If Summit is able to complete the project, it might help other parts of the greenway come through,” said Union County Public Relations Coordinator, Sebastian Delia.
The Rahway Valley Railroad runs from Summit to Roselle Park.
Beginning in Hidden Valley Park, the railroad right-of-way continues by connecting Houdaille Quarry, Briant Park, Meisel Park, Rahway River Parkway, Galloping Hill Golf Course and Black Brook Park.
The ending of the railway is on Westfield Avenue in Roselle Park.
The Staten Island Rapid Transit runs from Cranford to Staten Island, although the project would only include the section that runs from Cranford to Linden.
The possible inception in Cranford would be a lot on South Avenue East.
The ending of this trail would be in Linden at an empty lot.
A boardwalk would run over the existing tracks to ease line reactivation.
The impact of the controversial planned Pilgrim Pipeline, which would use this particular abandoned rail line to pipe crude oil, kerosene, and diesel fuel through Cranford, New Jersey and Roselle, New Jersey, is not known.
