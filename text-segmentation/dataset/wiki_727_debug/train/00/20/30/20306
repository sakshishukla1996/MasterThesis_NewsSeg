========,1,preface.
In chemistry, the mole fraction or molar fraction (x) is defined as the amount of a constituent (expressed in moles), "n", divided by the total amount of all constituents in a mixture (also expressed in moles), "n":
The sum of all the mole fractions is equal to 1:
The same concept expressed with a denominator of 100 is the mole percent or molar percentage or molar proportion (mol%).
The mole fraction is also called the amount fraction.
It is identical to the number fraction, which is defined as the number of molecules of a constituent "N" divided by the total number of all molecules "N".
The mole fraction is sometimes denoted by the lowercase Greek letter "χ" (chi) instead of a Roman "x".
For mixtures of gases, IUPAC recommends the letter "y".
The National Institute of Standards and Technology of the United States prefers the term amount-of-substance fraction over mole fraction because it does not contain the name of the unit mole.
Whereas mole fraction is a ratio of moles to moles, molar concentration is a quotient of moles to volume.
The mole fraction is one way of expressing the composition of a mixture with a dimensionless quantity; mass fraction (percentage by weight, wt%) and volume fraction (percentage by volume, vol%) are others.
========,2,Properties.
Mole fraction is used very frequently in the construction of phase diagrams.
It has a number of advantages:

========,3,Mass fraction.
The mass fraction "w" can be calculated using the formula where "M" is the molar mass of the component "i" and "M" is the average molar mass of the mixture.
Replacing the expression of the molar mass:

The mixing of two pure components can be expressed introducing the amount or molar mixing ratio of them ***formula***.
Then the mole fractions of the components will be:

The conversion to and from mass concentration "ρ" is given by:
where "M" is the average molar mass of the mixture.
========,3,Molar concentration.
The conversion to molar concentration "c" is given by:
or where "M" is the average molar mass of the solution, "c" is the total molar concentration and "ρ" is the density of the solution.
