The word is also used informally for a soldier in general of any rank (i.e.
"our "honvéds"" or an officer referred as a "honvédtiszt", "honvéd" officer).
This is because Hungarian military traditions are strictly defensive, despite the Hungarian army participating in offensives on foreign soil in both world wars.
The word "honvéd" has been in use since the Hungarian Revolution of 1848.
========,3,Ireland.
Private (Pte) ("saighdiúr singil" in Irish), is the lowest enlisted rank in the Irish Army.
Soldiers enlist as recruits then undergo a basic course of instruction.
There are three grades of private in the army.
After basic training the soldier is upgraded (rather than promoted) from recruit to private 2 star (Pte 2*) ("saighdiúr singil, 2 réalta").
After more corps-specific training (usually lasting eight weeks) the soldier is upgraded to private 3 star (Pte 3*) ("saighdiúr singil, 3 réalta").
All are usually just addressed as "private", although before being upgraded, recruits may be addressed as "recruit".
In corps units, the rank designation changes.

========,3,United States Army.
In the U.S. Army, private is used for the two lowest enlisted ranks, just below private first class.
The lowest rank is "private E-1" (PV1) and sometimes referred to as recruit, but also held by some soldiers after punishment through the Uniform Code of Military Justice or prisoners after conviction until they are discharged.
A PV1 wears no uniform insignia; since the advent of the Army Combat Uniform, the term "fuzzy" has come into vogue, referring to the blank velcro patch on the ACU where the rank would normally be placed.
The second rank, private E-2 (PV2), wears a single chevron, known colloquially as "mosquito wings".
Advancement to the PV2 is automatic after six months' time in service, but may get shortened to four months if given a waiver.
A person who earned the Eagle Scout award, the Gold Award, or completed at least two years of JROTC may enlist at any time at the rank of PV2.
The term of address, "Private", may be properly applied to any Army soldier E-1 (PV1) to E-3 (PFC).
It should also be noted that while a soldier is currently in Initial Enlistment Training, he or she will often be referred to as "Private" by the training cadre, regardless of actual rank, even if the soldier enlisted as a Specialist/E-4.

In the Marine Corps, privates first class are not referred to as "private"; it is more appropriate to use either "private first class" or "PFC".
