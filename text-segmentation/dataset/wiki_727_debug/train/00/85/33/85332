========,2,Usage.
To read a manual page for a Unix command, a user can type:
Pages are traditionally referred to using the notation "name(section)": for example, .
The section refers to different ways the topic might be referenced - for example, as a system call, or a shell (command line) command or package, or a package's configuration file, or as a coding construct / header.
The same page name may appear in more than one section of the manual, such as when the names of system calls, user commands, or macro packages coincide.
Examples are and , or and .
The syntax for accessing the non-default manual section varies between different man implementations.
On Solaris and illumos, for example, the syntax for reading is:
On Linux and BSD derivatives the same invocation would be:
which searches for "printf" in section 3 of the man pages.
========,2,Manual sections.
The manual is generally split into eight numbered sections, organized as follows (on Research Unix, BSD, macOS and Linux):
Unix System V uses a similar numbering scheme, except in a different order:
On some systems some of the following sections are available:
Some sections are further subdivided by means of a suffix; for example, in some systems, section 3C is for C library calls, 3M is for the math library, and so on.
A consequence of this is that section 8 (system administration commands) is sometimes relegated to the 1M subsection of the main commands section.
Some subsection suffixes have a general meaning across sections:
Some versions of man cache the formatted versions of the last several pages viewed.
========,2,Layout.
All man pages follow a common layout that is optimized for presentation on a simple ASCII text display, possibly without any form of highlighting or font control.
Sections present may include: 
***LIST***.
Other sections may be present, but these are not well standardized across man pages.
Common examples include: OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, ENVIRONMENT, BUGS, FILES, AUTHOR, REPORTING BUGS, HISTORY and COPYRIGHT.
