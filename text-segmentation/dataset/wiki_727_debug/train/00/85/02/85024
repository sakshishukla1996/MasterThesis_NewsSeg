========,1,preface.
In the seven-layer OSI model of computer networking, the network layer is layer 3.
The network layer is responsible for packet forwarding including routing through intermediate routers.
========,2,Functions.
The network layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable-length data sequences from a source to a destination host via one or more networks, while maintaining the quality of service functions.
Functions of the network layer include:
***LIST***.
Within the service layering semantics of the OSI network architecture, the network layer responds to service requests from the transport layer and issues service requests to the data link layer.
========,2,Relation to TCP/IP model.
The TCP/IP model describes the protocols used by the Internet.
The TCP/IP model has a layer called the Internet layer, located above the link layer.
In many textbooks and other secondary references, the TCP/IP Internet layer is equated with the OSI network layer.
However, this comparison is misleading, as the allowed characteristics of protocols (e.g., whether they are connection-oriented or connection-less) placed into these layers are different in the two models.
The TCP/IP Internet layer is in fact only a subset of functionality of the network layer.
It describes only one type of network architecture, the Internet.
