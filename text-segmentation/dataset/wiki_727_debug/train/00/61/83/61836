========,1,preface.
Treponema pallidum is a spirochaete bacterium with subspecies that cause treponemal diseases such as syphilis, bejel, pinta, and yaws.
They are helically coiled microorganisms that are usually 6-15 µm long and 0.1-0.2 µm wide.
The treponemes have a cytoplasmic and an outer membrane.
Using light microscopy, treponemes are visible only by using dark field illumination.
They are Gram negative, but some regard them as too thin to be Gram stained.
========,2,Subspecies.
At least four subspecies are known:
***LIST***.
Some variation occurs as to which are considered subspecies, and which are species.
The cause of pinta is sometimes described as "Treponema carateum", rather than a subspecies of "T. pallidum", even when the subspecies convention is used for the other agents.
========,2,Laboratory identification.
This bacterium can be detected with special stains, such as the Dieterle stain.
"T. pallidum" is also detected by serology, including nontreponemal VDRL, rapid plasma reagin, and treponemal antibody tests (FTA-ABS), "T. pallidum" immobilization reaction, and syphilis TPHA test).
It was first microscopically identified in syphilitic chancres by Fritz Schaudinn and Erich Hoffmann at the Charité in Berlin in 1905
========,2,Clinical Significance.
"T. p. pallidum" is a motile spirochaete that is generally acquired by close sexual contact, entering the host via breaches in squamous or columnar epithelium.
The organism can also be transmitted to a fetus by transplacental passage during the later stages of pregnancy, giving rise to congenital syphilis.
The helical structure of "T. p. pallidum" allows it to move in a corkscrew motion through mucous membranes or enter minuscule breaks in the skin.
In women the initial lesion is usually on the labia, the walls of the vagina, or the cervix; in men it is on the shaft or glans of the penis.
It gains access to the host's blood and lymph systems through tissue and mucous membranes.
Also in more severe cases, it may gain access to the host by infecting the skeletal bones and central nervous system of the body.
The subspecies causing yaws, pinta, and bejel, which often cause lesions on the skin and mucous membranes as well as on soft tissue and bone, are morphologically and serologically indistinguishable from "T. p. pallidum" (syphilis); however, their transmission is not venereal in nature and the course of each disease is significantly different.
The incubation period for a "T. p. pallidum" infection usually takes around 21 days, but can also range from 10 days to 90 days.
========,2,Genome.
The genome of "T. pallidum" was sequenced in 1998.
The recent sequencing of the genomes of several spirochetes permits a thorough analysis of the similarities and differences within this bacterial phylum.
"T. p. pallidum "has one of the smallest bacterial genomes at 1.14 million base pairs, and has limited metabolic capabilities, reflecting its adaptation through genome reduction to the rich environment of mammalian tissue.
The shape of "T. pallidum" is flat and wavy, unlike the other spirochetes, which are helical.
========,2,Vaccine.
No vaccine for syphilis is available as of 2017.
The outer membrane of "T. pallidum" has too few surface proteins for an antibody to be effective.
Efforts to develop a safe and effective syphilis vaccine have been hindered by uncertainty about the relative importance of humoral and cellular mechanisms to protective immunity, and because "T. pallidum" outer membrane proteins have not been unambiguously identified.
