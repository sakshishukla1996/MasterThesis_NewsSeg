========,1,preface.
One Hour with You is a 1932 American Pre-Code musical comedy film about a married couple who find themselves attracted to other people.
It was produced and directed by Ernst Lubitsch "with the assistance of" George Cukor, and written by Samson Raphaelson, from the play "Only a Dream" by Lothar Schmidt.
It stars Maurice Chevalier, Jeanette MacDonald and Genevieve Tobin and features Charles Ruggles and Roland Young.
A French-language version, called "Une heure pr√®s de toi" was made simultaneously, with Lili Damita playing Genevieve Tobin's role.
The film is a musical remake of "The Marriage Circle" (1924), the second film that Lubitsch made in the United States.
In 1932, "One Hour with You" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.
The film was preserved by the UCLA Film & Television Archive with the original color tints restored.
========,2,Plot.
Parisian doctor Andre Bertier (Maurice Chevalier) is faithful to his loving wife, Colette (Jeanette MacDonald), much to the surprise of his lovely female patients.
But when Colette's best friend Mitzi Olivier (Genevieve Tobin) insists upon being treated by Dr. Bertier, it looks to many of those concerned that Mitzi may succeed where the other willing ladies failed.
========,2,Production.
Lubitsch was originally scheduled to direct "One Hour with You", and supervised it in pre-production, but when the film he was directing before it, "The Man I Killed" went over schedule, Cukor was assigned to direct.
Within two weeks after filming started, however, conflicts between Chevalier and Cukor brought Lubitsch back to the helm, although Cukor remained on the set.
Both Cukor and Lubitsch demanded sole credit for directing, and the matter ended up in court, but was settled before a judgment was rendered, with Cukor receiving a credit for assisting and the right to break his contract with Paramount to direct "What Price Hollywood?"
at RKO.
