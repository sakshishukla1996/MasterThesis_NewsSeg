Sutter County is named after one of the state’s more engaging and complex historical personalities, and an agricultural visionary.
John Augustus Sutter, a German native born to Swiss parents, was one of the first to recognize the Sacramento Valley for its potential as an agricultural empire, and his Hock Farm, established in 1841 on the Feather River just south of present-day Yuba City, was the site of the valley’s first large agricultural enterprise.
Sutter obtained the Rancho New Helvetia Mexican land grant, and called his first settlement New Helvetia (which included the present day city of Sacramento).
In 1850, Sutter retired to Hock Farm when gold seekers deprived him of most of his holdings at Sacramento.
