========,1,preface.
XChat is an Internet Relay Chat client.
It has a choice of a tabbed document interface or tree interface, support for multiple servers, and numerous configuration options.
Both command line and graphical versions were available.
XChat is available for Unix-like systems; derivatives with native support for macOS's Aqua interface are also available (see below).
XChat's main source code tree has not received any patches since 2013.
Some Linux distributions, such as Fedora, maintain their own versions to fix bugs, keep the program working and able to build, and to resolve security issues.
A fork known as HexChat, formerly the Windows-specific X-Chat WDK, is still maintained, by October 2016.
========,2,Licensing.
The main body of XChat code is licensed under the GNU General Public License.
However, on August 23, 2004, the official build for Windows had become shareware, and had to be purchased after a 30-day trial period.
Previous builds for Windows were removed from the official site.
The authors stated that the shareware fee is required due to the excessive amount of time it took to make it compile under Windows.
This created controversy as Peter Železný did not have the copyright to all of the code which he was claiming to re-license, as well as linking proprietary shareware enforcement code against GPL-licensed code, making the Windows version of XChat a violation of copyright law and the GPL.
However, since the Unix version of XChat's code is open source under the GPL, several free non-official builds for Windows are being maintained.
========,2,Reception.
XChat has been described as popular, buildable for a variety of platforms.
In its heyday it was rated one of the best IRC clients for Linux.
"IRC Hacks: 100 Industrial-Strength Tips & Tools" goes into depth explaining its setup, configuration, and advanced features under Unix and macOS.
