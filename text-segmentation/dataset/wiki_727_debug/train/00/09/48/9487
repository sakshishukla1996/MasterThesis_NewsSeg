========,2,History.
========,3,Origin.
The letter Ε was taken over from the Phoenician letter He () when Greeks first adopted alphabetic writing.
In archaic Greek writing, its shape is often still identical to that of the Phoenician letter.
Like other Greek letters, it could face either leftward or rightward (), depending on the current writing direction, but, just like in Phoenician, the horizontal bars always faced in the direction of writing.
Archaic writing often preserves the Phoenician form with a vertical stem extending slightly below the lowest horizontal bar.
In the classical era, through the influence of more cursive writing styles, the shape was simplified to the current E glyph.
========,3,Sound value.
While the original pronunciation of the Phoenician letter "He" was , the earliest Greek sound value of Ε was determined by the vowel occurring in the Phoenician letter name, which made it a natural choice for being reinterpreted from a consonant symbol to a vowel symbol denoting an sound.
Besides its classical Greek sound value, the short phoneme, it could initially also be used for other -like sounds.
For instance, in early Attic before c.500 B.C., it was used also both for the long, open , and for the long close .
In the former role, it was later replaced in the classic Greek alphabet by Eta (Η), which was taken over from eastern Ionic alphabets, while in the latter role it was replaced by the digraph spelling ΕΙ.
========,3,Epichoric alphabets.
Some dialects used yet other ways of distinguishing between various e-like sounds.
In Corinth, the normal function of Ε to denote and was taken by a glyph resembling a pointed B (), while Ε was used only for long close .
The letter Beta, in turn, took the deviant shape .
In Sicyon, a variant glyph resembling an X () was used in the same function as Corinthian .
In Thespiai (Boeotia), a special letter form consisting of a vertical stem with a single rightward-pointing horizontal bar () was used for what was probably a raised variant of in pre-vocalic environments.
This tack glyph was used elsewhere also as a form of "Heta", i.e.
for the sound .
========,3,Glyph variants.
After the establishment of the , new glyph variants for Ε were introduced through handwriting.
In the uncial script (used for literary papyrus manuscripts in late antiquity and then in early medieval vellum codices), the "lunate" shape () became predominant.
In cursive handwriting, a large number of shorthand glyphs came to be used, where the cross-bar and the curved stroke were linked in various ways.
Some of them resembled a modern lowercase Latin "e", some a "6" with a connecting stroke to the next letter starting from the middle, and some a combination of two small "c"-like curves.
Several of these shapes were later taken over into minuscule book hand.
Of the various minuscule letter shapes, the inverted-3 form became the basis for lower-case Epsilon in Greek typography during the modern era.
