========,1,preface.
Tevye the Dairyman (, "Tevye der milkhiker", ) is the fictional narrator and protagonist of a series of short stories by Sholem Aleichem, originally written in Yiddish, and first published in 1894.
The character is best known from the fictional memoir "Tevye and His Daughters" (also called "Tevye's Daughters", "Tevye the Milkman" or "Tevye the Dairyman") as a pious Jewish milkman in Tsarist Russia with six troublesome daughters: Tzeitel, Hodel, Chava, Shprintze, Beilke, and Teibel.
He is also known from the musical dramatic adaptation of "Tevye and His Daughters", "Fiddler on the Roof."
The Village of Boyberik, where the stories are set, is based on the town of Boyarka in Ukraine (then part of the Russian Empire).
Tevye begins his literary life in 1894 with seven daughters.
Over time, as Tevye "tells" Aleichem the tales of his family life, six of his seven daughters (Beilke, Chava, Hodel, Shprintze, Taybele, and Tzeitel) are named, and of these five play leading roles in Tevye's stories.
The Tevye stories tell of his business dealings; the romantic dealings and marriages of several of his daughters; and the expulsion of the Jews from their village by the Russian government.
The Tevye stories have been adapted for stage and film several times.
Sholem Aleichem's own Yiddish stage adaptation was not produced during his lifetime; its first production, by Maurice Schwartz, was in 1919.
(Schwartz did a film based on the play twenty years later.)
Most famously, it was adapted as the Broadway musical and later film "Fiddler on the Roof".
The Broadway musical was based on a play written by Arnold Perl called "Tevye and His Daughters".
"Tevye the Dairyman" had three film adaptations: in Yiddish (1939), English (1971) and Russian (1991).

The original stories included events not depicted in "Fiddler on the Roof".
For instance, by the time of the events of "Lekh-Lekho", Tevye's wife Golde and Tzeitl's husband Motl (Motel) have both died (Tevye's daughter Shprintze is also dead, according to the story "Shprintze").
Also, in "Lekh-Lekho", upon learning of the Jews' expulsion, Chava leaves her Russian Orthodox husband, wanting to return to her family and share their exile.
Aleichem leaves it to the reader to decide whether Tevye forgives her and takes her back, saying:
and ending the story with "The old God of Israel still lives!"
========,2,Translations.
A 2009 translation includes a final short story entitled "Vachalaklokos "that takes place after "Lekh-Lekho".

Zero Mostel and Chaim Topol are the two actors most associated with the role of Tevye, although Theodore Bikel performed it many times on stage.
For the film version, the part ultimately went to Topol, as producer-director Norman Jewison felt that Mostel's portrayal was too unnecessarily comic.
He was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance in the film version of "Fiddler".
Other noteworthy musical Tevyes have included Luther Adler, Herschel Bernardi, Paul Lipson (original Broadway run, over 2,000 performances), Leonard Nimoy (1971 touring company), Shmuel Rodensky (original Israeli, Yiddish and German productions), Alfred Molina and Harvey Fierstein (2004 Broadway revival), Henry Goodman (2007 London revival) and Danny Burstein (2015 Broadway revival).
Paul Michael Glaser, who played Perchik in the 1971 film version, played Tevye in a 2013–14 touring production in the United Kingdom.
"Tevya" is the name of a 1939 film adaptation of the story, performed entirely in Yiddish.
In this adaptation, Tevye, played by Maurice Schwartz, is portrayed as gruff with flashes of wit and humor.
Prior to the 1964 Broadway debut of "Fiddler on the Roof", adaptations of the Tevye stories appeared on stage and screen, in America and beyond.
The earliest screen version was an American silent film called Broken Barriers, based on Rabinowitz's own theatrical treatment, was released in 1919 (just a few years after Rabinowitz died).
The Internet Movie Database also lists a German film from 1962 called "Tevya und seine Töchter" ("Tevya and His Daughters"), released in America as Tevye and His Seven Daughters.
After "Fiddler on the Roof" became a Broadway sensation, an Israeli film called "Tuvia Ve Sheva Benotav" (also "Tevye and His Seven Daughters") starring Shmuel Rodensky was released in 1968, as well as two Russian versions, "Tevye Molochnik" (Tevye the Milkman) in 1985, and "Izydi!"

in 1991.
