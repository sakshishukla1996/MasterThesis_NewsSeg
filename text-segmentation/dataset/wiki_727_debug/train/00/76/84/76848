========,1,preface.
In mathematics, a periodic function is a function that repeats its values in regular intervals or periods.
The most important examples are the trigonometric functions, which repeat over intervals of 2"π" radians.
Periodic functions are used throughout science to describe oscillations, waves, and other phenomena that exhibit periodicity.
Any function which is not periodic is called aperiodic.
========,2,Definition.
A function is said to be periodic with period ( being a nonzero constant) if we have for all values of in the domain.
If there exists a least positive constant with this property, it is called the fundamental period (also primitive period, basic period, or prime period.)
A function with period will repeat on intervals of length , and these intervals are referred to as periods.
Geometrically, a periodic function can be defined as a function whose graph exhibits translational symmetry.
Specifically, a function is periodic with period if the graph of is invariant under translation in the -direction by a distance of .
This definition of periodic can be extended to other geometric shapes and patterns, such as periodic tessellations of the plane.
========,2,Double-periodic functions.
A function whose domain is the complex numbers can have two incommensurate periods without being constant.
The elliptic functions are such functions.
========,2,Complex example.
Using complex variables we have the common period function:
As you can see, since the cosine and sine functions are periodic, and the complex exponential above is made up of cosine/sine waves, then the above (actually Euler's formula) has the following property.
If "L" is the period of the function then:

========,3,Antiperiodic functions.
One common generalization of periodic functions is that of antiperiodic functions.
This is a function "f" such that "f"("x" + "P") = −"f"("x") for all "x".
(Thus, a "P"-antiperiodic function is a 2"P"-periodic function.)
For example, the sine or cosine function is π-antiperiodic and 2π-periodic.
========,3,Bloch-periodic functions.
A further generalization appears in the context of Bloch waves and Floquet theory, which govern the solution of various periodic differential equations.
In this context, the solution (in one dimension) is typically a function of the form:
where "k" is a real or complex number (the "Bloch wavevector" or "Floquet exponent").
Functions of this form are sometimes called Bloch-periodic in this context.
A periodic function is the special case "k" = 0, and an antiperiodic function is the special case "k" = π/"P".
========,3,Quotient spaces as domain.
In signal processing you encounter the problem, that Fourier series represent periodic functions and that Fourier series satisfy convolution theorems (i.e.
convolution of Fourier series corresponds to multiplication of represented periodic function and vice versa), but periodic functions cannot be convolved with the usual definition, since the involved integrals diverge.
A possible way out is to define a periodic function on a bounded but periodic domain.
To this end you can use the notion of a quotient space:
That is, each element in ***formula*** is an equivalence class of real numbers that share the same fractional part.
Thus a function like ***formula*** is a representation of a 1-periodic function.
