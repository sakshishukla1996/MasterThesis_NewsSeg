In mathematics, the arithmetic–geometric mean (AGM) of two positive real numbers and is defined as follows:
First, compute the arithmetic and geometric means of and , calling them and respectively (the latter is the principal square root of the product ):
Then, use iteration, with taking the place of and taking the place of .
In this way, two sequences and are defined:
These two sequences converge to the same number, which is the arithmetic–geometric mean of and ; it is denoted by , or sometimes by .
This can be used for algorithmic purposes as in the AGM method, which makes it possible to construct fast algorithms for calculating exponential and trigonometric functions, as well as some mathematical constants, in particular, to quickly compute ***formula***.
========,2,Example.
To find the arithmetic–geometric mean of and , first calculate their arithmetic and geometric means, thus:
and then iterate as follows:
The first five iterations give the following values:
As can be seen, the number of digits in agreement (underlined) approximately doubles with each iteration.
The arithmetic–geometric mean of 24 and 6 is the common limit of these two sequences, which is approximately 13.4581714817256154207668131569743992430538388544.
========,2,History.
The first algorithm based on this sequence pair appeared in the works of Lagrange.
Its properties were further analyzed by Gauss.
========,2,Properties.
The geometric mean of two positive numbers is never bigger than the arithmetic mean (see inequality of arithmetic and geometric means); as a consequence, is an increasing sequence, is a decreasing sequence, and .
These are strict inequalities if .
If , then .
There is an integral-form expression for :
where is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind:
Indeed, since the arithmetic–geometric process converges so quickly, it provides an efficient way to compute elliptic integrals via this formula.
In engineering, it is used for instance in elliptic filter design.
========,2,Related concepts.
The reciprocal of the arithmetic–geometric mean of 1 and the square root of 2 is called Gauss's constant, after Carl Friedrich Gauss.
The geometric–harmonic mean can be calculated by an analogous method, using sequences of geometric and harmonic means.
The arithmetic–harmonic mean can be similarly defined, but takes the same value as the geometric mean.
The arithmetic–geometric mean can be used to compute – among others – logarithms, complete and incomplete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind, and Jacobi elliptic functions.
========,2,Proof of existence.
From the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means we can conclude that:
and thus that is, the sequence is nondecreasing.
Furthermore, it is easy to see that it is also bounded above by the larger of and (which follows from the fact that both the arithmetic and geometric means of two numbers lie between them).
Thus, by the monotone convergence theorem, the sequence is convergent, so there exists a such that:
However, we can also see that:
and so:
Q.E.D.
========,2,Proof of the integral-form expression.
This proof is given by Gauss.
Let Changing the variable of integration to ***formula***, where gives Thus, we have The last equality comes from observing that ***formula***.
Finally, we obtain the desired result
========,2,The AGM method.
Gauss noticed that the sequences as have the same limit:
the arithmetic–geometric mean, "agm".
It is possible to use this fact to construct fast algorithms for calculating elementary transcendental functions and some classical constants, in particular, the constant .
========,3,Applications.
========,4,The number "π".
For example, according to the Gauss–Salamin formula:
where which can be computed without loss of precision using
========,4,Other applications.
Using this property of the AGM along with the ascending transformations of Landen, Richard Brent suggested the first AGM algorithms for the fast evaluation of elementary transcendental functions ("e", cos "x", sin "x").
Subsequently, many authors went on to study the use of the AGM algorithms.
