========,1,preface.
The Apostles' Creed (Latin: "Symbolum Apostolorum" or "Symbolum Apostolicum"), sometimes entitled Symbol of the Apostles, is an early statement of Christian belief—a creed or "symbol".
It is widely used by a number of Christian denominations for both liturgical and catechetical purposes, most visibly by liturgical Churches of Western tradition, including the Roman Catholic Church, Lutheranism and Anglicanism.
It is also used by Presbyterians, Methodists and Congregationalists.
The Apostles' Creed is Trinitarian in structure with sections affirming belief in God the Father, Jesus Christ His Son and the Holy Spirit.
The Apostles' Creed was based on Christian theological understanding of the Canonical gospels, the letters of the New Testament and to a lesser extent the Old Testament.
Its basis appears to be the old Roman Creed known also as the Old Roman Symbol.
Because of the early origin of its original form, it does not address some Christological issues defined in the Nicene and other Christian Creeds.
It thus says nothing explicitly about the divinity of either Jesus or the Holy Spirit.
This makes it acceptable to many Arians and Unitarians.
Nor does it address many other theological questions which became objects of dispute centuries later.
The first mention of the expression "Apostles’ Creed" occurs in a letter of 390 AD from a synod in Milan and may have been associated with the belief, widely accepted in the 4th century, that, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, each of the Twelve Apostles contributed an article of a creed.
========,2,Origin.
The title "Symbolum Apostolicum" (Symbol or Creed of the Apostles) appears for the first time in a letter, probably written by Ambrose, from a Council in Milan to Pope Siricius in about 390 AD "Let them give credit to the Creed of the Apostles, which the Roman Church has always kept and preserved undefiled".
But what existed at that time was not what is now known as the Apostles' Creed but a shorter statement of belief that, for instance, did not include the phrase "maker of heaven and earth", a phrase that may have been inserted only in the 7th century.
The account of the origin of this creed, the forerunner and principal source of the Apostles' Creed, as having been jointly created by the Apostles under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, with each of the twelve contributing one of the articles, was already current at that time.
The earlier text evolved from simpler texts based on , part of the Great Commission, and it has been argued that it was already in written form by the late 2nd century (c. 180).
While the individual statements of belief that are included in the Apostles' Creed – even those not found in the Old Roman Symbol – are found in various writings by Irenaeus, Tertullian, Novatian, Marcellus, Rufinus, Ambrose, Augustine, Nicetas, and Eusebius Gallus, the earliest appearance of what we know as the Apostles' Creed was in the "De singulis libris canonicis scarapsus" ("Excerpt from Individual Canonical Books") of St. Pirminius (Migne, "Patrologia Latina" 89, 1029 ff.
), written between 710 and 714.
Bettenson and Maunder state that it is first from "Dicta Abbatis Pirminii de singulis libris canonicis scarapsus" ("idem quod excarpsus", excerpt), c. 750.
This longer Creed seems to have arisen in what is now France and Spain.
Charlemagne imposed it throughout his dominions, and it was finally accepted in Rome, where the Old Roman Symbol or similar formulas had survived for centuries.
It has been argued nonetheless that it dates from the second half of the 5th century, though no earlier.
Some have suggested that the Apostles' Creed was spliced together with phrases from the New Testament.
For instance, the phrase "descendit ad inferos" ("he descended into hell") echoes , "κατέβη εἰς τὰ κατώτερα μέρη τῆς γῆς" ("he descended into the lower, earthly regions").
It is of interest that this phrase first appeared in one of the two versions of Rufinus in A.D. 390 and then did not appear again in any version of the creed until A.D. 650.
This phrase and that on the communion of saints are articles found in the Apostles' Creed, but not in the Old Roman Symbol nor in the Nicene Creed.
========,2,Musical settings.
Musical settings of the Symbolum Apostolorum as a motet are rare.
The French composer Le Brung published one Latin setting in 1540, the Spanish composer Fernando de las Infantas published two in 1578.
More recently, in 1979 John Michael Talbot, a Third Order Franciscan, composed and recorded "Creed" on his album, "The Lord’s Supper".
In 1986 Graham Kendrick published the popular "We believe in God the Father", closely based on the Apostles' Creed.
Rich Mullins and Beaker also composed a musical setting titled "Creed", released on Mullins‘ 1993 album "A Liturgy, a Legacy, & a Ragamuffin Band".
The song "Creed" on Petra’s 1990 album "Beyond Belief" is loosely based on the Apostles' Creed.
In 1991, GIA Publications published a hymn text directly based on the Apostles’ Creed, called "I Believe in God Almighty."
It has been sung to hymn tunes from Wales, the Netherlands, and Ireland.
In 2014 Hillsong released a version of the Apostles' Creed under the title "This I Believe (The Creed)" on their album No Other Name.
In 2016 Keith Getty and Kristyn Getty released an expression of the Apostles' Creed under the title "We Believe (Apostle's Creed)" on their album "Facing a Task Unfinished".
========,2,Text in Greek.
The Greek text is ″not normally used in Greek and Eastern Orthodox churches″.
<poem> Πιστεύω εἰς θεòν πατέρα, παντοκράτορα, ποιητὴν οὐρανοῦ καὶ γῆς.
Καὶ (εἰς) Ἰησοῦν Χριστòν, υἱὸν αὐτοῦ τòν μονογενῆ, τòν κύριον ἡμῶν, Πιστεύω εἰς τò πνεῦμα τò ἅγιον, ἁγίαν καθολικὴν ἐκκλησίαν, ἁγίων κοινωνίαν, Ἀμήν.
========,2,English translations.
========,3,Ecumenical version.
The English Language Liturgical Consultation (ELLC) is an international ecumenical group whose primary purpose is to provide ecumenically accepted texts for those who use English in their liturgy.
In 1988 it produced a translation of the Apostles' Creed, distinguished among other things by its avoidance of the word "his" in relation to God.
The text is as follows:
========,3,Roman Catholic Church.
The "Catechism of the Catholic Church" gives the following English translation of the Apostles' Creed.
In its discussion of the Creed, the Catechism maintains the traditional division into twelve articles, the numbering of which is here added to the text.
The English text used in the Mass of the Roman Rite is:
========,3,Church of England.
In the Church of England there are currently two authorized forms of the creed: that of the "Book of Common Prayer" (1662) and that of "Common Worship" (2000).
Book of Common Prayer, 1662 <poem>I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth:
And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord, Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, Born of the Virgin Mary, Suffered under Pontius Pilate, Was crucified, dead, and buried:
He descended into hell; The third day he rose again from the dead; He ascended into heaven, And sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty; From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.
I believe in the Holy Ghost; The holy Catholick Church; The Communion of Saints; The Forgiveness of sins; The Resurrection of the body, And the Life everlasting.
Amen.</poem> Common Worship
========,3,Lutheran Church.
========,4,"Lutheran Service Book".
The "Lutheran Service Book" has the following text:
<poem>I believe in God, the Father Almighty,
And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord,
I believe in the Holy Spirit,
The creed is footnoted in the LSB for the word "Christian": ""Christian:" the ancient text reads "catholic," meaning the whole Church as it confesses the wholeness of Christian doctrine."
========,4,Church of Denmark.
The Church of Denmark still uses the phrase "We renounce the devil and all his doings and all his beings" as the beginning of this creed, before the line "We believe in God etc."
This is mostly due to the influence of Grundtvig.
========,3,United Methodist Church.
The United Methodists commonly incorporate the Apostles' Creed into their worship services.
The version which is most often used is located at #881 in the "United Methodist Hymnal", one of their most popular hymnals and one with a heritage to brothers John Wesley and Charles Wesley, founders of Methodism.
It is notable for omitting the line "he descended into hell", but is otherwise very similar to the Book of Common Prayer version.
The 1989 Hymnal has both the traditional version and the 1988 ecumenical version, which includes "he descended to the dead."
The "United Methodist Hymnal" also contains (at #882) what it terms the "Ecumenical Version" of this creed which is the ecumenically accepted modern translation of the International Committee on English Texts (1975) as amended by the subsequent successor body, the English Language Liturgical Consultation (1987).
This form of the Apostles' Creed can be found incorporated into the Eucharistic and Baptismal Liturgies in the Hymnal and in "The United Methodist Book of Worship", and hence it is growing in popularity and use.
The word "catholic" is intentionally left lowercase in the sense that the word catholic applies to the universal and ecumenical Christian church.
I believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth; And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord: who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried; the third day he rose from the dead; he ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.
========,2,Liturgical use in Western Christianity.
========,3,Roman Catholic Church.
========,4,Rite of Baptism.
An interrogative form of the Apostles' Creed is used in the Rite of Baptism (for both children and adults).
The minister of baptism asks the following questions (ICEL, 1974):
To each question, the catechumen, or, in the case of an infant, the parents and sponsor(s) (godparent(s)) in his or her place, answers "I do."
Then the celebrant says:
And all respond: Amen.
========,4,Profession of faith at Mass.
Since the 2002 edition, the Apostles' Creed is included in the Roman Missal with the indication, "Instead of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, especially during Lent and Easter time, the baptismal Symbol of the Roman Church, known as the Apostles’ Creed, may be used."
Previously the Nicene Creed was the only profession of faith that the Missal gave for use at Mass, except in Masses for children; but in some countries use of the Apostles’ Creed was already permitted.
========,3,Anglican Communion.
The Apostles' Creed is used in the non-Eucharistic services of Matins and Evening Prayer (Evensong).
It is invoked after the recitation or singing of the Canticles, and it is the only part of the services in which the congregation traditionally turns to face the altar, if they are seated transversely in the quire.
========,4,Episcopal Church (United States).
The Episcopal Church uses the Apostles' Creed as a Baptismal Covenant for those who are to receive the Rite of Baptism.
Regardless of age, candidates are to be sponsored by parents and/or godparents.
Youths able to understand the significance of the Rite may go through the ritual speaking for themselves.
Younger children and infants rely on their sponsors to act upon their behalf.
The celebrant calls for the candidates for Baptism to be presented.
The catechumen or sponsors state their request for Baptism.
If the catechumen is of age, the celebrant will ask him or her if he or she desires Baptism, to which the catechumen will respond: "I do."
If the candidate relies on sponsors, the celebrant asks them if they will raise the child in "the Christian faith and life" (ECUSA BCP), and will raise the child through "prayers and witness to grow into the full stature of Christ" to which the parents will state to each, "I will, with God's help."
A series of questions is then asked, to which the reply is always "I renounce them":
The second half of the query is asked, to which the reply is always "I do":
The Apostles' Creed is then recited by candidates, sponsors and congregation, each section of the Creed being an answer to the celebrant’s question, 'Do you believe in God the Father (God the Son, God the Holy Spirit)?'
========,3,Lutheran Church.
Lutherans following the "Lutheran Service Book" (Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod and the Lutheran Church–Canada), like Roman Catholics, use the Apostles' Creed during the Sacrament of Baptism:
Following each question, the candidate answers by saying "Yes, I believe".
If the candidate is a child, the godparents are to answer the questions.
For ELCA Lutherans who use the Evangelical Lutheran Worship book, the Apostles' Creed appears during the Sacrament of Holy Baptism Rite on p. 229 of the hardcover pew edition.
========,3,Methodism.
Methodists use the Apostles' Creed as part of their baptismal rites in the form of an interrogatory addressed to the candidate(s) for baptism and the whole congregation as a way of professing the faith within the context of the Church’s sacramental act.
For infants, it is the professing of the faith by the parents, sponsors, and congregation on behalf of the candidate(s); for confirmands, it is the professing of the faith before and among the congregation.
For the congregation, it is a reaffirmation of their professed faith.
