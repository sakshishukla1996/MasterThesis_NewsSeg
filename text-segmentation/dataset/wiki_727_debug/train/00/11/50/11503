========,3,Israel.
The FSM is one of the most consistent supporters of Israel (along with the United States) in international affairs.
Throughout the history of the United Nations General Assembly, it is claimed by some there has always been an "automatic majority" against Israel.
The United States has consistently opposed what it perceives as "unbalanced" "anti-Israel" resolutions and, in recent years, one other nation has joined Israel's defense — Micronesia.
The foreign policy goals of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) are primarily linked to achieving economic development and protecting their vast marine environment.
Israel was one of the first to welcome the FSM into the family of nations, even before the FSM became a member of the U.N.
According to the FSM U.N. deputy ambassador, Micronesia has since sought close bilateral relations with Israel in areas such as agriculture, technical training and health care training.
Israel has assisted the FSM in its early development.
As one Micronesian diplomat said, "We need Israeli expertise, so I don't see a change in our policy anytime soon."

The Compact went into effect on November 3, 1986, and the FSM became a sovereign nation in free association with the United States.
Under the Compact, the U.S. has full authority and responsibility for the defense of the FSM.
This security relationship can be changed or terminated by mutual agreement.
The Compact provides U.S. grant funds and federal program assistance to the FSM.
The basic relationship of free association continues indefinitely, but certain economic and defense provisions of the Compact expire in 2001, subject to renegotiation.
Negotiations on extending the Compact began in November 1999.
The United States is the FSM's largest trading partner.
The relationship is heavily imbalanced.
Of the FSM-US total balance of trade in goods in 2010 of US $38.3, the FSM imported $42.5 million in goods from the United States while exporting only US $4.2 million to the United States.
