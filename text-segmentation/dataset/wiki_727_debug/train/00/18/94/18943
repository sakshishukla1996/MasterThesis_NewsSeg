========,1,preface.
Married... with Children is an American television sitcom that aired on Fox, created by Michael G. Moye and Ron Leavitt.
Originally broadcast from April 5, 1987 to June 9, 1997, it is the longest-lasting live-action sitcom on Fox, and the first to be broadcast in the network's primetime programming slot.
The show follows the lives of Al Bundy, a once glorious high school football player turned hard-luck women's shoe salesman; his obnoxious wife, Peggy; their attractive, promiscuous, and clueless daughter, Kelly; and their girl-crazy, wisecracking son, Bud.
Their neighbors are the upwardly mobile Steve Rhoades and his feminist wife Marcy, who later gets remarried to Jefferson D'Arcy, a white-collar criminal who becomes her "trophy husband" and Al's sidekick.
Most storylines involve Al's schemes being foiled by his own cartoonish dim wit and bad luck.
The series comprises 259 episodes and 11 seasons.
Its theme song is "Love and Marriage" by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen, performed by Frank Sinatra from the 1955 television production "Our Town".
The first season of the series was videotaped at ABC Television Center in Hollywood.
From season two to season eight, the show was taped at Sunset Gower Studios in Hollywood, and the remaining three seasons were taped at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City.
The series was produced by Embassy Communications during its first season and the remaining seasons by ELP Communications under the studio Columbia Pictures Television.
In 2008, the show placed number 94 on "Entertainment Weekly" "New TV Classics" list.

It is never explained how Peggy was able to go to high school in Chicago when she lived in Wisconsin.
While the audience is aware that Al's father died years ago, his mother's whereabouts are never mentioned or acknowledged.
========,2,Episodes.
During its 11-season run on the Fox network, "Married ... with Children" aired 258 episodes.
A 259th episode, "I'll See You in Court" from season 3, never aired on Fox (see below), but premiered on FX and has since been included on DVD and in syndication packages.
The episode counts in the chart below include it.
Three specials also aired following the series' cancellation, including a cast reunion.
========,2,Nielsen ratings.
Despite the show's enduring popularity and loyal fanbase, "Married ... with Children" was never a huge ratings success.
Part of the reason was the fact that Fox, being a new startup network, did not have the affiliate base of the Big Three television networks, thus preventing the series from reaching the entire country.
In an interview for a special commemorating the series' 20-year anniversary in 2007, Katey Sagal stated that part of the problem the series faced was that many areas of the country were able to get Fox only through low-quality UHF channels well into the early 1990s, while some areas of the country did not receive the new network at all, a problem not largely rectified until the 1994 United States broadcast TV realignment which brought the NFC football rights to the network.
Another problem lay in the fact that many of the newly developed series on Fox were unsuccessful, which kept the network from building a popular lineup to draw in a larger audience.
In its original airing debut, "Married ... with Children" was part of a Sunday lineup that competed with the popular "Murder, She Wrote" and Sunday-night movie on CBS.
Fellow freshman series included "The Garry Shandling Show", "Duet", and "The Tracey Ullman Show", which were canceled in 1988, 1989, and 1990 respectively.
The success of "The Simpsons", which debuted on "The Tracey Ullman Show" in 1987, helped draw some viewers over to Fox, allowing "Married ... with Children" to sneak into the top 50 of television shows for seasons 3 through 9 doing its best overall rating at number 8 for its third and tenth season.
Although these ratings were somewhat small in comparison with the other three networks, they were good enough for Fox to keep renewing the show.

========,2,Controversy.
In 1989, Terry Rakolta, from Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, led a boycott of the show after viewing the episode "Her Cups Runneth Over".
Offended by the images of an old man wearing a woman's garter and stockings, the scene where Steve touches the pasties of a mannequin dressed in S&M gear, a homosexual man wearing a tiara on his head (and Al's line "...and they wonder why we call them 'queens'"), and a half-nude woman who takes off her bra in front of Al (and is shown with her arms covering her bare chest in the next shot), Rakolta began a letter-writing campaign to advertisers, demanding they boycott the show.
After advertisers began dropping their support for the show and whilst Rakolta made several appearances on television talk shows demanding the show's cancellation, Fox executives refused to air the episode titled "I'll See You in Court".
This episode would become known as the "Lost Episode" and was aired on FX on June 18, 2002, with some parts cut.
The episode was packaged with the rest of the third season in the January 2005 DVD release (and in the first volume of the "Married ... With Children Most Outrageous Episode" DVD set) with the parts cut from syndication restored.
Ironically, viewers' curiosity over the boycott and over the show itself led to a drastic ratings boost in an example of the Streisand Effect, which Rakolta has since acknowledged.
She has been referenced twice on the show: "Rock and Roll Girl", when a newscaster mentioned the city Bloomfield Hills, and "No Pot to Pease In", when a television show was made about the Bundy family and then was cancelled because (according to Marcy) "some woman in Michigan didn't like it".
The conservative Parents Television Council named "Married... with Children" the worst show of both the 1995–96 and 1996–97 television seasons in its first two years in operation.
In 1996, the organization called the show the "crudest comedy on prime time television...peppered with lewd punch lines about sex, masturbation, the gay lifestyle, and the lead character's fondness for pornographic magazines and strip clubs."
========,2,Home releases.
Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has released all eleven seasons of "Married... with Children" on DVD in Regions 1, 2, & 4.
On December 12, 2010, Sony released a complete series set on DVD in Region 1.
In December 2007, the Big Bundy Box—a special collection box with all seasons plus new interviews with Sagal and David Faustino—was released.
This boxset was released in Australia (Region 4) on November 23, 2009.
The Sony DVD box sets from season 3 onward do not feature the original "Love and Marriage" theme song in the opening sequence.
This was done because Sony was unable to obtain the licensing rights to the song for later sets.
Despite this, the end credits on the DVDs for season 3 still include a credit for "Love and Marriage."
On August 27, 2013, it was announced that Mill Creek Entertainment had acquired the home media rights to various television series from the Sony Pictures library including "Married... with Children" with the original theme song "Love and Marriage" sung by Frank Sinatra.
They have subsequently re-released the 11 seasons on DVD.
A complete series DVD set was re-released on July 7, 2015.
