========,1,preface.
Discordianism is a paradigm based upon the book the "Principia Discordia," written by Greg Hill with Kerry Wendell Thornley in 1963, the two working under the pseudonyms Malaclypse the Younger and Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst.
According to its primary historian (Adam Gorightly) Discordianism was founded as a parody religion.
Many outside observers still regard Discordianism as a parody religion although some of its adherents utilize it as a legitimate religion, or a metaphor for a governing philosophy.
The Principia Discordia, if read literally, encourages the worship of Eris, a.k.a.
Discordia, the Goddess of chaos, or archetypes and or ideals associated with her.
The Principia Discordia holds three core principles: the Aneristic Principle (order), the Eristic Principle (disorder) and the notion that both are mere illusions.
It is only by rejecting these principles that you can truly perceive reality.
It is difficult to estimate the number of Discordians because they are not required to hold Discordianism as their only belief system, and because there is an encouragement to form schisms and cabals.
========,2,Founding and structure.
The foundational document of Discordianism is the "Principia Discordia", fourth edition, written by Malaclypse the Younger, an alias of Greg Hill.
The "Principia Discordia" often hints that Discordianism was founded as a dialectic antithesis to more popular religions based on order, although the rhetoric throughout the book describes chaos as a much more underlying impulse of the universe.
This may have been done with the intention of merely "balancing out" the creative forces of order and disorder, but the focus is on the more disorderly aspects of the world – at times the forces of order are even vilified.
========,2,Mythology.
========,3,Eris and Aneris.
In discordian mythology, Aneris is described as the sister of Eris a.k.a.
Whereas Eris/Discordia is the Goddess of Disorder and Being, Aneris/Harmonia is the Goddess of Order and Non-Being.
"DOGMA III – HISTORY 32, 'COSMOGONY' " in "Principia Discordia", states:
The sterile Aneris becomes jealous of Eris (who was born pregnant), and starts making existent things non-existent.
This explains why life begins, and later ends in death.
The names of Eris and Aneris (who are later given a brother, "Spirituality"), are used to show some fundamental Discordian principles in "Psycho-Metaphysics":
========,4,Hand of Eris.
The hand of Eris (shown at right) and other proposed symbols are used informally in certain circles; however, it is unlikely that Eris will be assigned an official symbol by the IAU, since graphical symbols are rarely assigned to minor objects in modern times.
A request to the Unicode Consortium to add the hand as a unicode symbol to represent the planet, along with a symbol for 90377 Sedna, was filed in 2016.
========,4,The Original Snub.
The Original Snub is the Discordian name for the events preceding the Judgement of Paris, although more focus is put on the actions of Eris.
Zeus believes that Eris is a troublemaker, so he does not invite her to Peleus and Thetis's wedding.
Having been snubbed, Eris creates a golden apple with the word "kallisti" (Ancient Greek: , to the prettiest one) inscribed in it.
This, the Apple of Discord, is a notable symbol in Discordianism for its inclusion in the Holy Chao, and is traditionally described as being made of gold.
Some recent interpretations of the Original Snub place Eris as being not at all mischievous with her delivery of the apple, but instead suggest that Eris was simply bringing the apple as a wedding present for Thetis.
This interpretation would see Eris as innocent and her causing of chaos as a by-product of the other wedding guests' reaction upon seeing her at the wedding.
========,2,Philosophy.
========,3,Three core principles.
The "Principia Discordia" holds three core principles: the Aneristic Principle (order), the Eristic Principle (disorder) and the notion that both are mere illusions.
The following excerpt summarizes these principles:
========,3,Operation Mindfuck.
Operation Mindfuck or OM is an important practice in the Discordian religion.
The concept was developed by Kerry Thornley and Robert Anton Wilson in 1968 and given its name by Wilson and Robert Shea in "The Illuminatus!
========,2,Writings.
Discordian works include a number of books, not all of which actually exist.
Among those that have been published are "Principia Discordia", first published in 1965 (which includes portions of "The Honest Book of Truth"); and "The Illuminatus!
Trilogy", which had its first volume published in 1975.
The Principia Discordia is a Discordian religious text written by Greg Hill (Malaclypse the Younger) with Kerry Wendell Thornley (Lord Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst).The phrase "Principia Discordia", reminiscent of Newton's "Principia Mathematica", is presumably intended to mean "Discordant Principles", or "Principles of Discordance".
One of the most influential of all Discordian works, "The Illuminatus!
Trilogy" is a series of three novels written by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson purportedly between 1969 and 1971.
In a 1980 interview given to the science fiction magazine "Starship", Wilson suggested the novel was an attempt to build a myth around Discordianism.
"Zen Without Zen Masters" is a book by Camden Benares (The Count of Five), published in 1977, of koans, stories and exercises of a Discordian nature.
It includes tales of several early Discordians including Hill (as Mal) and Thornley (as Omar and Ho Chi Zen).
"Enlightenment of a Seeker" from this book is also present in "Principia Discordia" as "A Zen Story".
"Zenarchy" was first self-published by Thornley, under the pen name Ho Chi Zen, as a series of one-page (or "broadsheet") newsletters in the 1960s.
A selection of the material was later reedited and expanded by Thornley and republished in paperback by IllumiNet Press in 1991.
The book describes Thornley's concept of Zenarchy "a way of Zen applied to social life.
A non-combative, non-participatory, no-politics approach to anarchy intended to get the serious student thinking."
"Summa Universalia" was another work by Malaclypse the Younger, purported to be a summary of the Universe.
It was excerpted in the first edition of "Principia" but never published.
It was mentioned in an introduction to one of the "Principia" editions, and the work was quoted from in the first edition.
========,3,"Principia Discordia" editions.
The first edition was printed using Jim Garrison's Xerox printer in 1963.
The second edition was published under the title "Principia Discordia or How The West Was Lost" in a limited edition of five copies in 1965.
The "Principia Discordia or How The West Was Lost" was first published in a limited edition of five copies and released into the public domain in 1965.
Reprints of the Fourth and Fifth Editions include:
***LIST***.
In 1978, a copy of a work from Kerry Thornley titled "THE PRINCIPIA Discordia or HOW THE WEST WAS LOST" was placed in the HSCA JFK collections as document 010857.
Adam Gorightly, author of "The Prankster and the Conspiracy" about Kerry Thornley and the early Discordians, said the copy in the JFK collection was not a copy of the first edition but a later and altered version containing some of the original material.
In an interview with researcher Brenton Clutterbuck, Gorightly said he had been given Greg Hill's copy of the first edition.
This appeared in its entirety in "Historia Discordia", a book on Discordian history released in spring of 2014.
========,3,Related works.
========,4,"The Black Iron Prison".
"The Black Iron Prison" was an effort to create an updated, modern book that would function as "Principia Discordia" did when released.
The collaborators stated that "while the original "Principia Discordia" holds important messages and philosophies, we wondered if some of the humor and language might be dated and lost on a younger generation of Discordians.
We wanted to crystalize some of our favorite themes from the "Principia", those of radical free will and self-emancipation."
The goal was to encourage "critical thinking and self awareness" in the reader.
========,4,"Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia: The Tales of Shamlicht".
"Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia: The Tales of Shamlicht" by Reverend Loveshade with "foreplay" or foreword by S. John Ross was published in 2012 by Anaphora Literary Press.
The controversial book reportedly was inspired by an investigation by the FBI with portions of the book having been previously seized.
"Ek-sen-trik-kuh Discordia" includes blurbs (short reviews of the book) by R. Crumb, Sondra London, Alan Moore, Rev.
Ivan Stang, Robert Anton Wilson (who saw an early draft), and others.
It was listed in January 2013 in both the print and online version of the "New York Review of Books".
The book was soon pulled from publication after allegations of plagiarism were made on amazon.com and sent to the publisher.
An editor denied the claims which did not specify what material was allegedly plagiarized.
========,4,"Historia Discordia".
"Historia Discordia" was compiled by Adam Gorightly with foreword by Robert Anton Wilson.
It is a compilation of early Discordian photos, tracts, art collages, and more including works by Discordianism founders Greg Hill (Malaclypse the Younger) and Kerry Thornley (Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst).
Among other things, it contains the long-missing "The Honest Book of Truth" and the first edition of "Principia Discordia".
It was reviewed on goodreads.com, and features a blurb by famed comic book writer Alan Moore.
