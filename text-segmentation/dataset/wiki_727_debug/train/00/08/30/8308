========,3,Early history.
The city of Delft came into being aside a canal, the 'Delf', which comes from the word "delven", meaning delving or digging, and led to the name Delft.
It presumably started around the 11th century as a landlord court.
From a rural village in the early Middle Ages, Delft developed to a city, that in the 13th century (1246) received its charter.
(For some more information about the early development, see Gracht)."
The town's association with the House of Orange started when William of Orange (Willem van Oranje), nicknamed William the Silent (Willem de Zwijger), took up residence in 1572.
At the time he was the leader of growing national Dutch resistance against Spanish occupation, known as the Eighty Years' War.
By then Delft was one of the leading cities of Holland and it was equipped with the necessary city walls to serve as a headquarters.
An attack by Spanish forces in October of that year was repelled.
After the Act of Abjuration was proclaimed in 1581, Delft became the "de facto" capital of the newly independent Netherlands, as the seat of the Prince of Orange.
When William was shot dead in 1584, by Balthazar Gerards in the hall of the Prinsenhof, the family's traditional burial place in Breda was still in the hands of the Spanish.
Therefore, he was buried in the Delft Nieuwe Kerk (New Church), starting a tradition for the House of Orange that has continued to the present day.
========,3,Delft Explosion.
The Delft Explosion, also known in history as the Delft Thunderclap, occurred on 12 October 1654 when a gunpowder store exploded, destroying much of the city.
Over a hundred people were killed and thousands were wounded.
About of gunpowder were stored in barrels in a magazine in a former Clarissen convent in the Doelenkwartier district.
Cornelis Soetens, the keeper of the magazine, opened the store to check a sample of the powder and a huge explosion followed.
Luckily, many citizens were away, visiting a market in Schiedam or a fair in The Hague.
Today, the explosion is remembered primarily for killing Rembrandt's most promising pupil, Carel Fabritius, and destroying almost his entire oeuvre; a pivotal event in Donna Tartt's Pulitzer Prize-winning 2013 novel "The Goldfinch".
Delft artist Egbert van der Poel painted several pictures of Delft showing the devastation.

========,2,Culture.
Delft is well known for the Delft pottery ceramic products which were styled on the imported Chinese porcelain of the 17th century.
The city had an early start in this area since it was a home port of the Dutch East India Company.
It can still be seen at the pottery factories De Koninklijke Porceleyne Fles (or Royal Delft) and De Delftse Pauw.
The painter Johannes Vermeer (1632â€“1675) was born in Delft.
Vermeer used Delft streets and home interiors as the subject or background of his paintings.
Several other famous painters lived and worked in Delft at that time, such as Pieter de Hoogh, Carel Fabritius, Nicolaes Maes, Gerard Houckgeest and Hendrick Cornelisz.

========,2,Education.
Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) is one of four universities of technology in the Netherlands.
It was founded as an academy for civil engineering in 1842 by King William II.
Today just under 20,000 students are enrolled.
The UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education, providing postgraduate education for people from developing countries, draws on the strong tradition in water management and hydraulic engineering of the Delft university.
========,2,Nature and recreation.
East of Delft a relatively vast nature and recreation area called the "Delftse Hout" ("Delft Wood") is situated.
Apart from a forest, through which bike-, horseride- and footpaths are leading, it also comprises a vast lake (suitable for swimming and windsurfing), narrow beaches, a restaurant, community gardens, plus campground and other recreational and sports facilities.

Inside the city apart from a central park there are also several smaller town parks, like "Nieuwe Plantage", "Agnetapark", "Kalverbos" and others.
