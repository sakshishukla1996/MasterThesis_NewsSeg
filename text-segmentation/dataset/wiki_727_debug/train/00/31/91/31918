========,1,preface.
The University of Rochester ( U of R or UR) frequently referred to simply as Rochester, is a private, nonsectarian, research university in Rochester, New York.
The university grants undergraduate and graduate degrees, including doctoral and professional degrees.
The university has six schools and various interdisciplinary programs.
The University of Rochester is particularly noted for its Eastman School of Music.
The university is also home to the Institute of Optics, founded in 1929, the first educational program in the US devoted exclusively to optics.
Rochester's Laboratory for Laser Energetics is home to the second most energetic fusion laser in the world.
In its history, five university alumni, two faculty, and one senior research associate at Strong Memorial Hospital have been awarded a Nobel Prize; eight alumni and four faculty members have won a Pulitzer Prize, and 19 faculty members have been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship.
The departments of political science and economics have made a significant and consistent impact on positivist social science since the 1960s; the distinctive, mathematical approach pioneered at Rochester and closely affiliated departments is known as the Rochester school, and Rochester graduates and former affiliates are highly represented at faculties across top economics and political science departments.
The University of Rochester, across all of its schools and campuses, enrolls approximately 5,600 undergraduates and 4,600 graduate students.
Its 158 buildings house over 200 academic majors.
Additionally, Rochester (along with its affiliated Strong Health System) is the largest employer in the Greater Rochester area and the sixth largest employer in New York.
========,2,History.
The University of Rochester was founded in 1850 as a Baptist-sponsored institution.
The impetus to form the university came primarily from the town of Hamilton, New York, which has been home to Colgate University since 1819.
In 1848, the Baptist Education Society planned to move Colgate University (then known as Madison University) to the city of Rochester, but was halted by legal action in Hamilton.
Dissenting Colgate trustees, faculty, and students founded the University of Rochester with a charter granted from the Regents of the University of the State of New York on January 31, 1850.
Classes began that November, with approximately 60 students enrolling, including 28 transfers from Madison.
The University of Rochester's campus was originally in downtown Rochester at the United States Hotel, which was located on Buffalo Street near Elizabeth Street, which today is West Main Street near the I-490 overpass.
In 1853, the campus moved east to a then-suburban location on what is now University Avenue.
Local businessman and Congressman Azariah Boody donated of land for the new campus, and the University purchased a further from him.
UR would remain on this campus until the current River Campus was constructed in 1930, and the university continues to own a small part of the University Avenue campus (where the university-owned Memorial Art Gallery is located).
The first female students were admitted in 1900, the result of an effort led by Susan B. Anthony and Helen Barrett Montgomery.
During the 1890s, a number of women took classes and labs at the university as "visitors" but were not officially enrolled nor were their records included in the college register.
President David Jayne Hill allowed the first woman, Helen E. Wilkinson, to enroll as a normal student, although she was not allowed to matriculate or to pursue a degree.
Thirty-three women enrolled among the first class in 1900, and Ella S. Wilcoxen was the first to receive a degree, in 1901.
When the River Campus was completed in 1930, male students moved there while the female students remained on the University Avenue campus until 1955.
Major growth occurred under the leadership of Rush Rhees, during his 1900-1935 tenure.
During this time, George Eastman became a major donor, giving more than $50 million to the university.
The first Ph.D. was awarded in 1925.
In 1955, the separate colleges for men and women were merged into The College.
In 1958, three new schools were created in engineering, business administration, and education.
During World War II, Rochester was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.
Between 1946 and 1947, in infamous uranium experiments researchers at the university injected uranium-234 and uranium-235 into six people to study how much uranium their kidneys could tolerate before becoming damaged.
In 1995, university president Thomas H. Jackson announced the launch of a "Renaissance Plan" for The College that, among several changes, reduced enrollment and created a more selective admissions process.
The plan also revised the undergraduate curriculum significantly, creating the current system with only one required course and only a few distribution requirements (known as "clusters").
========,3,Naming controversy.
In the mid-1980s, the University commissioned a study to determine if the name of the institution should be changed, most likely to "Eastman University."
The study concluded that a name change could be beneficial because the use of a place name in the title led respondents to incorrectly believe that it was a public university, and because the name "Rochester" connoted a "cold and distant outpost."
Reports of the latter conclusion led to controversy and criticism in the Rochester community.
Ultimately, the name "University of Rochester" was retained.
========,2,Administration.
The university is headed by a board of trustees, with Danny Wegman being the chairman.
The board appoints the president of the university, currently Joel Seligman, who replaced Thomas H. Jackson on July 1, 2005.
========,2,Campuses.
========,3,River Campus.
The River Campus is the center of the university's academic and administrative activities.
It is located in a bend of the Genesee River about south of downtown Rochester and covers around .
It is bounded by Bausch & Lomb Riverside Park, an public park along the east bank of the Genesee River, and Mount Hope Cemetery, where the grave sites of Susan B. Anthony and Frederick Douglass can be found.
The original buildings of the campus were dedicated in 1930.
The main academic buildings, designed in the Greek revival style, are centered around the Eastman Quadrangle (generally referred to as the academic quad) which is formed by Rush Rhees Library and Dewey, Bausch & Lomb, Morey, and Lattimore Halls.
The Eastman Quad is widely considered the best landscaped area of the university, and includes the eponymous statue of George Eastman, installed in 2009, and sculpted by noted American sculptor Marc Mellon.
Rush Rhees Library, the unofficial symbol of the university, is also home to the Hopeman Memorial Carillon, the largest carillon in New York State, featuring 50 bells that chime on the quarter-hour.
During the summer, the carillon features a recital series in which various artists perform on the instrument.
Over the course of the last several decades, other academic buildings have been built south of the Eastman Quad, including Meliora Hall (1972), Hoyt Hall (1962), Harkness Hall (1946), Gavett Hall (dedicated with the Eastman Quad in 1930), and the Hopeman Engineering Building (1963).
The southernmost part of the River Campus contains the new Science and Engineering Quadrangle: Wilmot Building (1961), Hylan Building (1971), Hutchison Hall (1972), the Computer Studies Building and Carlson Library (1987), the Robert B. Goergen Hall for Biomedical Engineering and Optics (2007), and Wegmans Hall housing the Goergen Institute for Data Science (2017).
LeChase Hall (2013) and the Ronald Rettner Hall for Media Arts and Innovation (2013) were added to the north of the Eastman Quad on the Wilson Quadrangle behind Lattimore Hall and Morey Hall, respectively.
The recently constructed LeChase Hall (dedicated in May 2013) houses the Warner School of Education and is the first building to be constructed on the Wilson Quadrangle in 30 years.
The building is named after R. Wayne LeChase, a university trustee whose donation helped make construction of the building possible.
A four-story, 65,000-square-foot facility, it provides a unified home for the Warner School and features an expansive suite of 14 classrooms on the first floor that serves the College during the day and the Warner School in the evening.
The Warner School is housed on the upper three floors, unified by a dramatic three-story atrium, with additional classrooms, offices and spaces specifically designed to support the preparation and professional development of educators and the conduct of educational research and reform work.
Students often congregate outdoors during the warmer months on the various quads.
Other centers of student life include Todd Union, Frederick Douglass Dining Center, various locations inside Rush Rhees Library, and Wilson Commons, a student union designed by the architectural firm of I.M.
Many academic buildings, including Rush Rhees Library, are connected by a series of tunnels, which are used extensively, especially during unfavorable weather.
Most academic buildings and common areas, as well as residence halls, have authenticated Wi-Fi internet access.
========,3,Other campuses.
The University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC) is the primary campus for the university's medical education and research as well as the main patient care facility.
The Medical Center is located adjacent to the River Campus and is dominated by Strong Memorial Hospital, the School of Medicine and Dentistry building and the Arthur Kornberg Medical Research Building.
URMC also houses the School of Nursing and a variety of research centers, including the Wilmot Cancer Center, the Aab Institute of Biomedical Sciences, and the Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute.
The Eastman School of Music is situated on its own campus in downtown Rochester, which includes a residence for students, classroom and performance facilities, and the Eastman Theatre, a 3,094-seat concert hall which also serves as the primary venue of the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra.
The campus also features the Sibley Music Library, which is the largest academic music library in North America, as well as the largest privately owned collection of sheet music.
Students are housed at 100 Gibbs Street, a dormitory building constructed in 1991.
The South Campus is located in Brighton, immediately south of Rochester proper.
The campus includes the Laboratory for Laser Energetics, the Center for Optics Manufacturing, the Center for Optoelectronics and Imaging, and the now defunct Nuclear Structure Research Laboratory (NSRL).
Graduate student housing is also provided at the Whipple Park complex.

========,2,Academics.
The University of Rochester's undergraduate enrollment consists of about 5,800 full-time and about 200 part-time students from across the U.S. and over 115 countries.
Graduate enrollment comprises about 3,900 full-time and about 1,100 part-time graduate students.
The university has more than 103,000 living alumni and employs nearly 2,300 tenure-track faculty, with more than 20,000 faculty and staff across the university and the Strong Health System.
UR's faculty include fellows of all four National Academies of the U.S., Guggenheim Fellows, and recipients of many other awards and recognitions.
The unique, defining feature of the undergraduate program at the University is the Rochester Curriculum.
There are no required subjects outside of a prerequisite writing course, which may be petitioned out of.
The Curriculum requires that undergraduates study in all of three areas of knowledge: humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences.
Aside from the area of study which a student's major falls in, undergraduates must complete 3-4 courses of related materials (called "clusters") within each of the remaining areas.
For example, a student with a concentration in mathematics, a natural science field, must complete at least one cluster in the humanities and one in social sciences.
A second concentration or a minor also satisfies this requirement.
The only exceptions are students concentrating in an accredited engineering field (biomedical engineering, chemical engineering, electrical and computer engineering or mechanical engineering), who are only required to have one cluster in either humanities or social sciences.
The University of Rochester is known for its several unique 5th year programs.
Students may apply for the Take Five Scholars program, a tuition free 5th year of study in a field of interest unrelated to their undergraduate major.
The university also offers a Kauffman Entrepreneurial Year (KEY) Scholarship, a tuition-free 5th year of study offered to those with an innovative and unique entrepreneurial project impacting the campus or Rochester community.
Both programs are competitive and students may apply during their junior or senior year.
Various other scholar programs exist for UR students, including the highly selective Rochester Early Medical Scholars (REMS) and Rochester Early Business Scholar (REBS) programs.
Students must apply for these prior to entering the university.
========,3,Rankings.
UR was one of the 25 New Ivies in the 2007 Kaplan/Newsweek "How to Get into College Guide."
The list names institutions whose caliber of students is considered to rival traditional Ivy League schools.
The rankings are based on admissions statistics as well as interviews with administrators, students, faculty, and alumni.
Admission into the University of Rochester has become increasingly competitive, with an average acceptance rate of 34% (34% for transfer students) for the fall of 2015.

Recently, the university has also engaged in a series of new initiatives to expand its programs in biomedical engineering and optics, including the construction of the new $37 million Robert B. Goergen Hall for Biomedical Engineering and Optics on the River Campus.
Other new research initiatives include a cancer stem cell program and a Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute.
UR also has the ninth highest technology revenue among U.S. higher education institutions, with $46 million being paid for commercial rights to university technology and research in 2009. Notable patents include Zoloft and Gardasil.
WeBWorK, a web-based system for checking homework and providing immediate feedback for students, was developed by University of Rochester professors Gage and Pizer.
The system is now in use at over 800 universities and colleges, as well as several secondary and primary schools.
Rochester scientists work in diverse areas; for example, physicists developed a technique for etching metal surfaces, such as platinum, titanium and brass, with powerful lasers, enabling self-cleaning surfaces that repel water droplets and will not rust if tilted at a 4 degree angle; and medical researchers are exploring how brains rid themselves of toxic waste during sleep.
========,2,Student life.
UR's official symbol is the seal of the university, which features a book, representing arts and sciences, a lyre symbolizing music, and a modified symbol of medicine.
The official flower of the university is the dandelion, purportedly prolific on the cow pasture that became the university's second campus.
The official mascot of the university is a predatory wasp found throughout Rochester, the Yellowjacket.
From 1983 to 2008, the yellowjacket mascot was named "URBee."
However, when the university re-designed the mascot during the 2007-2008 academic year, a new name was chosen and as of February 1, 2008, the school's mascot is now known as "Rocky".
The university uses Dandelion Yellow and Rochester Blue as its official colors, which are the prominent colors on the official regalia.
The motto of UR is Meliora, which loosely translates to "better" with the connotation of "ever better," the meaning adopted by the university.
The image of Rush Rhees Library's main dome serves as an additional icon for the University of Rochester.
UR also has official logos for the university as a whole as well as individual units, including the College of Arts, Sciences, and Engineering, the University of Rochester Medical Center, and the Eastman School of Music.
President Seligman, as part of his efforts to improve UR's external appearance, commissioned Bill Murphy, the Vice President of Communications, to start an initiative to develop a new graphic identity, including a new logo, in hopes of improving uniformity and overall usage of official standards.
During March 2007, the communications office was soliciting opinions and comments on finalist designs for the new logo, which was unveiled later that fall.
The song most often sung at college events, led often by the school's many a cappella groups, is "The Genesee", written by former Rochester student Thomas Thackeray Swinburne (Class of 1892).
Although less frequently used, the university also has an official Alma Mater, "The Dandelion Yellow".
========,3,Student organizations.
The student body at the University of Rochester is both ethnically and socioeconomically diverse.
There are over 200 active Students' Association recognized groups on campus, which range from cultural dance groups to U of R's comedy improv troupe In Between the Lines.
Since 1873, the University has regularly printed its student newspaper, the "Campus Times".
There is also the student-run, online-only publication, "The Rival Rochester".
This is a source of opinion, commentary, and satire.
Several a cappella groups play a prominent role in campus life.
The YellowJackets competed on Season 3 of NBC's "The Sing-Off" during the fall 2011 season, finishing 7th nationwide.

========,3,Students' Association.
The Students' Association (SA) is the primary student governing body and includes most of the student groups at UR.
The SA is governed by the SA Senate, President and Vice President, all of whom are elected by the student body.
The SA President may choose to appoint an advisory cabinet made up of a group of volunteer students.
There is also a judicial branch, composed of the All Campus Judicial Council (ACJC), the members of whom are nominated by an interview committee and approved by the SA Senate.
The SA Senate meets weekly and the longest meeting on record lasted longer than 8 hours.
The offices of the SA are located in the Wilson Commons student union.
All student groups are required to have a constitution, elected officers, and approval from senate in order to be recognized by the SA and have access to university funds.
These funds are given yearly based on budgets submitted to the Students' Association Appropriation Committee (SAAC) with supplemental funds available through special forms.
All funds are derived from the mandatory Student Activities Fee.
========,3,Athletics.
UR's athletics teams are called the Yellowjackets.
They participate in the Division III of the NCAA and in the University Athletic Association and Liberty League.
One exception to this is the men's squash team, which is consistently ranked top 5 in Division I.
The University fields men's teams in baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, rowing, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, and track and field.
