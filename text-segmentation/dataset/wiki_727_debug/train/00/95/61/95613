========,3,Distilling.
Daviess County has long had a reputation as the leading center of the production of distilled spirits, chiefly Kentucky bourbon.
Walter McFarland, who moved here from North Carolina, began making whiskey and peach brandy in about 1804 on a estate just south of Panther Creek, on today's U.S. 431.
Cornelius Westerfield also began distilling corn whiskey in the early 1800s on his farm three miles (5Â km) southwest of Whitesville, Kentucky, on Deserter Creek.
It finally closed in 1872, after more than 60 years of production.
By the 1880s, 18 large distilleries operated in Daviess County at the same time.
Today only three remain.
One dates back to 1869, the former Glenmore Distillery Company, which was originally the R. Monarch Distillery.
Charles Medley Distillers Kentucky is at least the 59th distillery in the county's history.
Trinidad-based Angostura Limited bought the Medley Distillery in 2007 with plans to make its entrance into the world's bourbon market, but the severe global recession slowed plans for starting bourbon production in Daviess County for the first time since 1992.

========,3,Coal mining.
The southwestern portion of the county around the Panther Creek area was heavily mined through the 1960s till the early 1990s.
After 1998 large tracts of mined land were left unclaimed.
Then after a lengthy search for contractors by the state government's Division of Abandoned Mine Lands, work commenced on the largest tract, a tract once part of the now defunct Green Coal Company.
The of unclaimed land were part of Green Coal Company's mine once known as the "Panther Surface Mine".
Green Coal Company was a staple mining company in Daviess County and was based nearby in Henderson.
Reclamation work commenced at the site on November 8, 1999, and was completed April 14, 2000.
The licensed blaster employed by the contractor blasted the highwall into the pit, resulting in a reduced effort to grade and dress the final slope.
Enough topsoil was gained from the area above the highwall to allow a growing medium for re-vegetation purposes.
Through innovative field techniques and extraordinary cooperation from the contractor, this site has been returned to a very safe, stable and productive property.
All of this project was reclaimed expending $127,538.82 of the available bond.
The land is now safe for the public and is considered prime farm property once again.
