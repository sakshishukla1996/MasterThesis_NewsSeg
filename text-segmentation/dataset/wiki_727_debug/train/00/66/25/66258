The original Almdudler is a sweetened carbonated beverage made of herbal extracts.
Almdudler has been called the "national drink of Austria".
Its popularity in Austria is second only to Coca-Cola.
About 80 million litres of the beverage are produced per year.
Almdudler is currently sold in original, light (sugar-free), "still" (uncarbonated), and "g'spritzt" (mixed with carbonated mineral water) versions.
In Austria, a "Radler" variety (mixed with beer), is available as "Almradler".
In the wine-growing regions of Lower Austria and Burgenland, it is a popular mixer with locally produced red and white wine.
========,2,History.
After three years of development, Almdudler was produced from 1957 by the Viennese entrepreneur Erwin Klein (1924–1983).
According to the company's website, he derived the name from the then-common phrase "auf der Alm dudeln", which means "yodeling in the (alpine) pasture".
The drink was originally created and marketed as an alternative to alcoholic beverages or as a mixer for alcoholic drinks.
Klein promoted the popularity of Almdudler through advertising and sponsoring at major sporting events, such as the 1964 Winter Olympics held in Innsbruck.
Since 1973, the Almdudler company only functions as a license supplier.
========,2,Marketing and distribution.
Almdudler is currently bottled in Austria, Germany, Belgium, and Switzerland.
It is further exported to the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, the Netherlands, Romania, Australia, and the United States.
The Almdudler advertising messages succeeded in passing on a kind of "Heimat" emotion standing out from "global" beverages.
The slogan of a widely known advertising campaign, in the local Austro-Bavarian dialect, has become a well-known phrase in Austria: "Wenn de kan Oimdudla haum, geh' i wieda ham!"
(Standard German: "Wenn die keinen Almdudler haben, gehe ich wieder heim!"
English: If they don’t have Almdudler, I'll go back home!).
This advertising concept was written by Creative Director Simon North, an Englishman.
