========,3,Native Americans.
The Brazos Indian Reservation, founded by General Randolph B. Marcy in 1854, provided a safety area from warring Comanche for Delaware, Shawnee, Tonkawa, Wichita, and Caddo.
Within the reservation, each tribe had its own village and cultivated agricultural crops.
Government-contracted beeves were delivered each week.
Citizens were unable to distinguish between reservation and non-reservation tribes, blaming Comanche and Kiowa depredations on the reservation Indians.
A newspaper in Jacksboro, Texas titled "The White Man " advocated removal of all tribes from north Texas.
During December 1858, Choctaw Tom, at times an interpreter to Sam Houston, and a group of reservation Indians received permission for an off-the-reservation hunt.
On December 27, Captain Peter Garland and a vigilante group charged Choctaw Tom’s camp, indiscriminately murdering and injuring women and children along with the men.
Governor Hardin Richard Runnels ordered John Henry Brown to the area with 100 troops.
An examining trial was conducted about the Choctaw Tom raid, but no indictments resulted.
May 1859, John Baylor and a number of whites confronted United States troops at the reservation, demanding the surrender of certain tribal individuals.
The military balked, and Baylor retreated, but in so doing killed an Indian woman and an old man.
Baylor’s group was later attacked by Indians off the reservation, where the military had no authority to intervene.
In May 1871, Kiowa medicine man Satank (Sitting Bear), and Kiowa chiefs Satanta (White Bear), Addo-etta (Big Tree) and Maman-ti (Skywalker) led a force of over 100 Kiowa, Comanche, Kiowa-Apaches, Arapaho, and Cheyenne warriors from the Oklahoma Fort Sill Reservation into Texas.
On May 18, the Indians attacked a wagon train belonging to Henry Warren, killing all but the five who escaped.
Commanding General of the United States Army William Tecumseh Sherman, personally arrested Satank, Satanta, and Big Tree at Fort Sill and had them tried in civil court in Jacksboro.
Satank was killed in an attempted escape, and others were found guilty and sentenced to hang.
Their sentences were commuted by Governor Edmund J. Davis at the request of a group of Quakers, and they were later paroled.
The incident was a key element that led to the Red River War.
