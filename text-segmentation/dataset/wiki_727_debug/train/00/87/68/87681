========,2,History.
As the capital of the Romanized Gallic tribe the Lingones, it was called "Andematunnum", then "Lingones", and now Langres.
The town is built on a limestone promontory of the same name.
This stronghold was originally occupied by the Gauls, and, at a later date the Romans fortified the town belonging to the Celtic tribe the Lingones; Andemantunum the strategic cross-roads of twelve Roman roads.
The 1st century Triumphal Gate and the many artefacts exhibited in the museums are witnesses to the Gallo-Roman town.
After the period of invasions, the town prospered in the Middle Ages due, in part, to the growing political influence of its bishops.
The diocese covered Champagne, the Duchy of Burgundy and Franche-Comté, and the bishops gained the right to coin money in the 9th century and to name the military governor of the city in 927.
The Bishop of Langres was a duke and peer of France.
The troubled 14th and 15th centuries were reason enough for the town to strengthen its fortifications, which still give the old part of the city its fortified character, and Langres entered a period of royal tutelage.
The Renaissance, which returned prosperity to the town, saw the construction of numerous fine civil, religious and military buildings that still stand today.
In the 19th century, a "Vauban" citadel was added.
