========,2,Early life.
Tony Hawk was born on May 12, 1968 in Carlsbad, California, to Nancy and Frank Peter Rupert Hawk, and was raised in San Diego, California.
When Hawk was young, he was described as being "hyperactive," and his mother says that he was "so hard on himself and expected himself to do so many things."
One time, Hawk struck out in baseball and was so distraught that he hid in a ravine and had to be "physically coaxed out" by his father.
His frustration with himself was so harsh that his parents had him psychologically evaluated at school.
The results were that Tony was "gifted," he tested with an I.Q.
of 144, and school advisers recommended placing him in advanced classes.
Hawk attended Jean Farb Middle School from 1980 to 1981, and eventually returned for the show, "Homecoming with Rick Reilly", where he set up a ramp and did a demonstration.
His parents supported his skateboarding because it served as an outlet for his excessive energy, and as Hawk's skills developed, he became a professional skateboarder at age fourteen.
Hawk was the National Skateboard Association world champion for twelve consecutive years.

On June 27, 1999, Hawk was the first skater to land a "900", a trick involving the completion of two-and-a-half mid-air revolutions on a skateboard; Hawk was successful on his twelfth attempt.

In 2011, Hawk was still able to land the trick and posted a video on his Twitter account stating, "I'm 43 and I did a 900 today."

While in India, the group visited Gandhi's house, the skateboarders were greeted by a very excited young audience and the 540-degree maneuver was executed during the skateboarding demonstration—the Indian trip was published on Hawk's RIDE YouTube channel on February 4, 2013.

Tony Hawk's the best."

... and then Tony's just, like, Tony Hawk—he's like, basically, to me it says, "You can be a skater and take over everything and be, you know ... and use skateboarding to be ... a businessman, a ... role model to young people", um, he's just the best.

Yeah, Tony's the man, sure, he's the best.

I was just, kinda like, "it's kinda touchy, you know what I mean, like?"
It's kinda weird, you know?
Tony's kid, he rides for Birdhouse.
But I look at it, like, I picture him on Baker, you know what I mean?
So we just approached Tony, "Yeah, we wanna talk to Riley about maybe gettin' some Baker boards, or something like that."
And Tony's like, "Man, he's rippin', he's nineteen years-old, he can, you know, it's really up to him.
You guys talk to him, you know?"
So we just kinda said, "You wanna get some boards?
", he's like, "I'm down, man!"
