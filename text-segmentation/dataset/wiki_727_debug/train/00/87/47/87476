Head cheese or brawn is a cold cut that originated in Europe.
A version pickled with vinegar is known as souse.
Head cheese is not a dairy cheese, but a terrine or meat jelly made with flesh from the head of a calf or pig, or less commonly a sheep or cow, and often set in aspic.
The parts of the head used vary, but the brain, eyes, and ears are usually removed.
The tongue, and sometimes the feet and heart, may be included.
It can also be made from trimmings from pork and veal, adding gelatin to the stock as a binder.
Head cheese may be flavored with onion, black pepper, allspice, bay leaf, salt, and vinegar.
It is usually eaten cold or at room temperature.
Historically, meat jellies were made of the cleaned (all organs removed) head of the animal, which was simmered to produce stock, a peasant food made since the Middle Ages.
When cooled, the stock congeals because of the natural gelatin found in the skull.
The aspic may need additional gelatin, or more often, reduction to set properly.

Souse is pickled meat and trimmings usually made from pig's feet, chicken feet or cow's tongue, to name a few.
The cooked meat or trimmings are cut into bite-sized pieces and soaked in a brine made of water, lime juice, cucumbers, hot pepper, salt and specially prepared seasonings.
It is usually eaten on Saturday mornings, especially in St. Vincent and Barbados.
In Trinidad and Tobago, it is served or sold at most social gatherings, such as parties, all-inclusive fetes and sporting competitions.

In Panama, it is known as "sao" (from Caribbean English souse), made with pig's feet and prepared the same way as in the Caribbean; it is a dish from the Caribbean coast, where most of Panama's West Indian community lives.
