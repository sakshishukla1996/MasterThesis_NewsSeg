========,2,History.
Boys Town was founded on December 12, 1917, as an orphanage for boys, then called the "City of Little Men".
It was founded by Edward J. Flanagan, a Roman Catholic priest working in Omaha, Nebraska at that time.
The City of Little Men pioneered and developed new juvenile care methods in twentieth-century America, emphasizing social preparation as a model for public boys' homes worldwide."
In 1943, Boys Town adopted as its image and logo a picture of a boy carrying a younger boy on his back, captioned "He ain't heavy, Father, he's my brother."
They felt it epitomized the importance of their residents caring for each other and having someone care about them.
The saying inspired a song and album by The Hollies.
