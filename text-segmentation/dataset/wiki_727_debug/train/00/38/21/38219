========,1,preface.
Toilet humour, or scatological humour, is a type of off-colour humour dealing with defecation, urination and flatulence, and to a lesser extent vomiting and other body functions.
It sees substantial crossover with sexual humour, such as dick jokes.
Toilet humour is popular among a wide range of ages, but is especially popular with children and teenagers, for whom cultural taboos related to acknowledgement of waste excretion still have a degree of novelty.
The humour comes from the rejection of such taboos, and is a part of modern culture.
Examples can also be found in earlier literature, including "The Canterbury Tales" by Geoffrey Chaucer.
========,2,Television.
Toilet humour is common in television shows such as "Beavis and Butt-Head", "The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy", "The Ren & Stimpy Show", "Rugrats", "Rocko's Modern Life", "Aaahh!!!
Real Monsters", "Ed, Edd n Eddy", "South Park", "Family Guy", "The Simpsons", "Futurama", "Rick and Morty", "Adventure Time", "", "Regular Show", "American Dad!
", "The Fairly OddParents", "SpongeBob SquarePants" and "Kenny vs. Spenny".
========,2,Song.
Toilet humour is also found in song and rhyme, particularly schoolboy songs.
Examples of this are found in Mozart and scatology, and variants of the German folk schoolboys' song known as the "Schei√üe-Lied" (English: "Shit-Song") which is indexed in the German "Volksliederarchiv".
