========,1,preface.
Crucifixion is a method of capital punishment in which the victim is tied, nailed, or otherwise attached to a large wooden beam and left to hang for several days until eventual death from exhaustion and asphyxiation.
It is principally known from classical antiquity, but remains in occasional use in some countries.
The crucifixion of Jesus is a central narrative in Christianity, and the cross (sometimes depicting Jesus nailed onto it) is the main religious symbol for many Christian churches.
========,2,Terminology.
Ancient Greek has two verbs for crucify: "ana-stauro" (ἀνασταυρόω), from "stauros", "stake", and "apo-tumpanizo" (ἀποτυμπανίζω) "crucify on a plank," together with "anaskolopizo" (ἀνασκολοπίζω "impale").
In earlier pre-Roman Greek texts "anastauro" usually means "impale."
New Testament Greek uses four verbs, three of them based upon "stauros" (σταυρός), usually translated "cross".
The most common term is "stauroo" (σταυρόω), "to crucify", occurring 43 times; "sustauroo" (συσταυρόω), "to crucify with" or "alongside" occurs five times, while "anastauroo" (ἀνασταυρόω), "to crucify again" occurs only once at the Epistle to the Hebrews 6:6.
"prospegnumi" (προσπήγνυμι), "to fix or fasten to, impale, crucify" occurs only once at the Acts of the Apostles 2:23.
The English term "cross" derives from the Latin word "crux".
The Latin term "crux" classically referred to a tree or any construction of wood used to hang criminals as a form of execution.
The term later came to refer specifically to a cross.
The English term "crucifix" derives from the Latin "crucifixus" or "cruci fixus", past participle passive of "crucifigere" or "cruci figere", meaning "to crucify" or "to fasten to a cross".
========,2,Details.
Crucifixion was most often performed to dissuade its witnesses from perpetrating similar (usually particularly heinous) crimes.
Victims were sometimes left on display after death as a warning to any other potential criminals.
Crucifixion was usually intended to provide a death that was particularly slow, painful (hence the term "excruciating", literally "out of crucifying"), gruesome, humiliating, and public, using whatever means were most expedient for that goal.
Crucifixion methods varied considerably with location and time period.
The Greek and Latin words corresponding to "crucifixion" applied to many different forms of painful execution, from impaling on a stake to affixing to a tree, to an upright pole (a crux simplex) or to a combination of an upright (in Latin, "stipes") and a crossbeam (in Latin, "patibulum").
In some cases, the condemned was forced to carry the crossbeam to the place of execution.
A whole cross would weigh well over 135 kg (300 lb), but the crossbeam would not be quite as burdensome, weighing around 45 kg (100 lb).
The Roman historian Tacitus records that the city of Rome had a specific place for carrying out executions, situated outside the Esquiline Gate, and had a specific area reserved for the execution of slaves by crucifixion.
Upright posts would presumably be fixed permanently in that place, and the crossbeam, with the condemned person perhaps already nailed to it, would then be attached to the post.
The person executed may have been attached to the cross by rope, though nails and other sharp materials are mentioned in a passage by the Judean historian Josephus, where he states that at the Siege of Jerusalem (70), "the soldiers out of rage and hatred, "nailed" those they caught, one after one way, and another after another, to the crosses, by way of jest."
Objects used in the crucifixion of criminals, such as nails, were sought as amulets with perceived medicinal qualities.
While a crucifixion was an execution, it was also a humiliation, by making the condemned as vulnerable as possible.
Although artists have traditionally depicted the figure on a cross with a loin cloth or a covering of the genitals, the person being crucified was usually stripped naked.
Writings by Seneca the Younger state some victims suffered a stick forced upwards through their groin.
Despite its frequent use by the Romans, the horrors of crucifixion did not escape mention by some of their eminent orators.
Cicero for example, described crucifixion as "a most cruel and disgusting punishment", and suggested that "the very mention of the cross should be far removed not only from a Roman citizen's body, but from his mind, his eyes, his ears."
Frequently, the legs of the person executed were broken or shattered with an iron club, an act called "crurifragium", which was also frequently applied without crucifixion to slaves.
This act hastened the death of the person but was also meant to deter those who observed the crucifixion from committing offenses.
========,3,Cross shape.
The gibbet on which crucifixion was carried out could be of many shapes.
Josephus describes multiple tortures and positions of crucifixion during the Siege of Jerusalem as Titus crucified the rebels; and Seneca the Younger recounts: "I see crosses there, not just of one kind but made in many different ways: some have their victims with head down to the ground; some impale their private parts; others stretch out their arms on the gibbet."
At times the gibbet was only one vertical stake, called in Latin "crux simplex".
This was the simplest available construction for torturing and killing the condemned.
Frequently, however, there was a cross-piece attached either at the top to give the shape of a T ("crux commissa") or just below the top, as in the form most familiar in Christian symbolism ("crux immissa").
Jehovah's Witnesses argue that Jesus was crucified on a "crux simplex", and that the "crux immissa" was an invention of Emperor Constantine.
Other forms were in the shape of the letters X and Y.
Apparently the most ancient image of a Roman crucifixion is a graffito found in a taberna (hostel for wayfarers) in Puteoli, dating to the time of Trajan or Hadrian (late 1st century to early 2nd century CE).
The cross is the T shape.
An inscription over the individual's left shoulder identifies her as "Alkimila."
The New Testament writings about the crucifixion of Jesus do not speak specifically about the shape of that cross, but the early writings that do speak of its shape, from about the year 100 CE on, describe it as shaped like the letter T (the Greek letter tau) or as composed of an upright and a transverse beam, sometimes with a small projection in the upright.
========,3,Nail placement.
In popular depictions of the crucifixion of Jesus (possibly because in translations of the wounds are described as being "in his hands"), Jesus is shown with nails in his hands.
But in Greek the word "χείρ", usually translated as "hand", could refer to the entire portion of the arm below the elbow, and to denote the "hand" as distinct from the "arm" some other word could be added, as "ἄκρην οὔτασε χεῖρα" (he wounded the end of the χείρ, i.e., "he wounded her in the hand".
A possibility that does not require tying is that the nails were inserted just above the wrist, between the two bones of the forearm (the radius and the ulna).
An experiment that was the subject of a documentary on the National Geographic Channel's "Quest For Truth: The Crucifixion", showed that nailed feet provided enough support for the body, and that the hands could have been merely tied.
Nailing the feet to the side of the cross relieves strain on the wrists by placing most of the weight on the lower body.
Another possibility, suggested by Frederick Zugibe, is that the nails may have been driven in at an angle, entering in the palm in the crease that delineates the bulky region at the base of the thumb, and exiting in the wrist, passing through the carpal tunnel.
A foot-rest ("suppedaneum") attached to the cross, perhaps for the purpose of taking the person's weight off the wrists, is sometimes included in representations of the crucifixion of Jesus, but is not discussed in ancient sources.
Some scholars interpret the Alexamenos graffito, the earliest surviving depiction of the Crucifixion, as including such a foot-rest.
Ancient sources also mention the "sedile", a small seat attached to the front of the cross, about halfway down, which could have served a similar purpose.
In 1968, archaeologists discovered at Giv'at ha-Mivtar in northeast Jerusalem the remains of one Jehohanan, who had been crucified in the 1st century.
The remains included a heel bone with a nail driven through it from the side.
The tip of the nail was bent, perhaps because of striking a knot in the upright beam, which prevented it being extracted from the foot.
A first inaccurate account of the length of the nail led some to believe that it had been driven through both heels, suggesting that the man had been placed in a sort of sidesaddle position, but the true length of the nail, 11.5 cm (4.53 inches), suggests instead that in this case of crucifixion the heels were nailed to opposite sides of the upright.
The skeleton from Giv'at ha-Mivtar is currently the only recovered example of ancient crucifixion in the archaeological record.
========,3,Cause of death.
The length of time required to reach death could range from hours to days depending on method, the victim's health, and the environment.
A literature review by Maslen and Mitchell identified scholarly support for several possible causes of death: cardiac rupture, heart failure, hypovolemic shock, acidosis, asphyxia, arrhythmia, and pulmonary embolism.
Death could result from any combination of those factors or from other causes, including sepsis following infection due to the wounds caused by the nails or by the scourging that often preceded crucifixion, eventual dehydration, or animal predation.
A theory attributed to Pierre Barbet holds that, when the whole body weight was supported by the stretched arms, the typical cause of death was asphyxiation.
He wrote that the condemned would have severe difficulty inhaling, due to hyper-expansion of the chest muscles and lungs.
The condemned would therefore have to draw himself up by his arms, leading to exhaustion, or have his feet supported by tying or by a wood block.
When no longer able to lift himself, the condemned would die within a few minutes.
Some scholars, including Frederick Zugibe, posit other causes of death.
Zugibe suspended test subjects with their arms at 60° to 70° from the vertical.
The test subjects had no difficulty breathing during experiments, but did suffer rapidly increasing pain, which is consistent with the Roman use of crucifixion to achieve a prolonged, agonizing death.
However, Zugibe's positioning of the test subjects' feet are not supported by any archaeological or historical evidence.
========,3,Survival.
Since death does not follow immediately on crucifixion, survival after a short period of crucifixion is possible, as in the case of those who choose each year as a devotional practice to be non-lethally crucified.
There is an ancient record of one person who survived a crucifixion that was intended to be lethal, but that was interrupted.
Josephus recounts: "I saw many captives crucified, and remembered three of them as my former acquaintance.
I was very sorry at this in my mind, and went with tears in my eyes to Titus, and told him of them; so he immediately commanded them to be taken down, and to have the greatest care taken of them, in order to their recovery; yet two of them died under the physician's hands, while the third recovered."
Josephus gives no details of the method or duration of the crucifixion of his three friends before their reprieve.
========,2,Ancient practice.
Although the ancient Jewish historian Josephus, as well as other sources, refers to the crucifixion of thousands of people by the Romans, there is only a single archaeological discovery of a crucified body dating back to the Roman Empire around the time of Jesus.
This was discovered at Givat HaMivtar, Jerusalem in 1968.
It is not necessarily surprising that there is only one such discovery, because a crucified body was usually left to decay on the cross and therefore would not be preserved.
The only reason these archaeological remains were preserved was because family members gave this particular individual a customary burial.
The remains were found accidentally in an ossuary with the crucified man's name on it, 'Jehohanan, the son of Hagakol'.
Nicu Haas, an anthropologist at the Hebrew University Medical School in Jerusalem, examined the ossuary and discovered that it contained a heel bone with a nail driven through its side, indicating that the man had been crucified.
The position of the nail relative to the bone indicates that the feet had been nailed to the cross from their side, not from their front; various opinions have been proposed as to whether they were both nailed together to the front of the cross or one on the left side, one on the right side.
The point of the nail had olive wood fragments on it indicating that he was crucified on a cross made of olive wood or on an olive tree.
Since olive trees are not very tall, this would suggest that the condemned was crucified at eye level.
Additionally, a piece of acacia wood was located between the bones and the head of the nail, presumably to keep the condemned from freeing his foot by sliding it over the nail.
His legs were found broken, possibly to hasten his death.
It is thought that because in Roman times iron was rare, the nails were removed from the dead body to conserve costs.
According to Haas, this could help to explain why only one nail has been found, as the tip of the nail in question was bent in such a way that it could not be removed.
Haas had also identified a scratch on the inner surface of the right radius bone of the forearm, close to the wrist.
He deduced from the form of the scratch, as well as from the intact wrist bones, that a nail had been driven into the forearm at that position.
However, much of Haas' findings have been challenged.
For instance, it was subsequently determined that the scratches in the wrist area were non-traumatic — and, therefore, not evidence of crucifixion — while reexamination of the heel bone revealed that the two heels were not nailed together, but rather separately to either side of the upright post of the cross.
========,2,History and religious texts.
========,3,Pre-Roman states.
Crucifixion (or impalement), in one form or another, was used by Persians, Carthaginians, and Macedonians.
The Greeks were generally opposed to performing crucifixions.
However, in his "Histories", ix.120–122, the Greek writer Herodotus describes the execution of a Persian general at the hands of Athenians in about 479 BCE: "They nailed him to a plank and hung him up ... this Artayctes who suffered death by crucifixion."
The "Commentary on Herodotus" by How and Wells remarks: "They crucified him with hands and feet stretched out and nailed to cross-pieces; cf.
vii.33.
This barbarity, unusual on the part of Greeks, may be explained by the enormity of the outrage or by Athenian deference to local feeling."
Some Christian theologians, beginning with Paul of Tarsus writing in Galatians , have interpreted an allusion to crucifixion in Deuteronomy .
This reference is to being hanged from a tree, and may be associated with lynching or traditional hanging.
However, Rabbinic law limited capital punishment to just 4 methods of execution: stoning, burning, strangulation, and decapitation, while the passage in Deuteronomy was interpreted as an obligation to hang the corpse on a tree as a form of deterrence.
The fragmentary Aramaic Testament of Levi (DSS 4Q541) interprets in column 6: "God ... (partially legible)-"will set" ... right errors.
... (partially legible)-"He will judge" ... revealed sins.
Investigate and seek and know how Jonah wept.
Thus, you shall not destroy the weak by wasting away or by ... (partially legible)-"crucifixion" ... Let not the nail touch him."
The Jewish king Alexander Jannaeus, king of Judea from 103 BCE to 76 BCE, crucified 800 rebels, said to be Pharisees, in the middle of Jerusalem.
Alexander the Great is reputed to have crucified 2,000 survivors from his siege of the Phoenician city of Tyre, as well as the doctor who unsuccessfully treated Alexander's friend Hephaestion.
Some historians have also conjectured that Alexander crucified Callisthenes, his official historian and biographer, for objecting to Alexander's adoption of the Persian ceremony of royal adoration.
In Carthage, crucifixion was an established mode of execution, which could even be imposed on generals for suffering a major defeat.
========,3,Ancient Rome.
The hypothesis that the Ancient Roman custom of crucifixion may have developed out of a primitive custom of "arbori suspendere"—hanging on an "arbor infelix" ("inauspicious tree") dedicated to the gods of the nether world—is rejected by William A. Oldfather, who shows that this form of execution (the "supplicium more maiorum", punishment in accordance with the custom of our ancestors) consisted of suspending someone from a tree, not dedicated to any particular gods, and flogging him to death.
Tertullian mentions a 1st-century CE case in which trees were used for crucifixion, but Seneca the Younger earlier used the phrase "infelix lignum" (unfortunate wood) for the transom ("patibulum") or the whole cross.
Plautus and Plutarch are the two main sources for accounts of criminals carrying their own patibulum to the upright stipes.
Crucifixion was used to punish slaves, pirates, and enemies of the state.
It was considered the most shameful and disgraceful way to die.
Condemned Roman citizens were usually exempt from crucifixion and flogging under the Porcian laws, except as a matter of military discipline in the legions.
Death was often hastened by human action.
"The attending Roman guards could only leave the site after the victim had died, and were known to precipitate death by means of deliberate fracturing of the tibia and/or fibula, spear stab wounds into the heart, sharp blows to the front of the chest, or a smoking fire built at the foot of the cross to asphyxiate the victim."
Notorious mass crucifixions followed the Third Servile War in 73–71 BCE (the slave rebellion under Spartacus), other Roman civil wars in the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE, and the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE.
Crassus crucified 6,000 of Spartacus' followers hunted down and captured after his defeat in battle.
Josephus tells a story of the Romans crucifying people along the walls of Jerusalem.
He also says that the Roman soldiers would amuse themselves by crucifying criminals in different positions.
In Roman-style crucifixion, the condemned could take up to a few days to die.
Under ancient Roman penal practice, crucifixion was also a means of exhibiting the criminal's low social status.
It was the most dishonourable death imaginable, originally reserved for slaves, hence still called "supplicium servile" by Seneca, later extended to citizens of the lower classes ("humiliores").
The citizen class of Roman society were almost never subject to capital punishments; instead, they were fined or exiled.
Josephus mentions Jews of high rank who were crucified, but this was to point out that their status had been taken away from them.
The Romans often broke the prisoner's legs to hasten death and usually forbade burial.
Occasionally, scourging preceded crucifixion, which would cause the condemned to lose a large amount of blood, and approach a state of shock.
The convict then usually had to carry the horizontal beam ("patibulum" in Latin) to the place of execution, but not necessarily the whole cross.
Crucifixion was typically carried out by specialized teams, consisting of a commanding centurion and four soldiers.
When it was done in an established place of execution, the vertical beam ("stipes") could even be permanently embedded in the ground.
It's claimed by certain religious texts that the victims of crucifixion were stripped naked before being put on the cross—all the New Testament gospels describe soldiers gambling for the robes of Jesus.
The 'nails' were tapered iron spikes approximately long, with a square shaft across.
Corpses of the crucified were typically left on the crosses to decompose and be eaten by animals.
Constantine the Great, the first Christian emperor, abolished crucifixion in the Roman Empire in 337 out of veneration for Jesus Christ, its most famous victim.
========,3,In Islam.
The Qur'an mentions crucifixion several times.
In Surah 7:124, "Fir'awn" (i.e.
the Pharaoh of "Exodus") says that he will "crucify" his chief wizards.
Also, Surah 12:41 mentions Prophet Yusuf (Joseph) prophesying that the king (the current ruler of the land he was stranded in) would crucify one of his prisoners.
In Surah 5:32-5:33, the Qur'an mentions crucifixion as a form of punishment for many types of crimes.
The verses' context are about the different forms of appropriate punishments.
They begin by discussing the Israelite belief about executing murderers and those who "spread mischief through the land".
It then elaborates on when killings are appropriate for Muslims to undertake.
There are four different punishments for the different severities of crimes.
On that account: "We ordained for the Children of Israel that if any one slew a person - unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land - it would be as if he slew the whole people: and if any one saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people.
Then although there came to them Our apostles with clear signs, yet, even after that, many of them continued to commit excesses in the land."
(Surah 5:32)
The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Apostle, and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is: execution, or crucifixion, or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides, or exile from the land: that is their disgrace in this world, and a heavy punishment is theirs in the Hereafter.
Surah 5:33 Crucifixion was in use by the Umayyads.
========,3,Japan.
Crucifixion was introduced into Japan during the Sengoku period (1467–1573), after a 350-year period with no capital punishment.
It is believed to have been suggested to the Japanese by the introduction of Christianity into the region, although similar types of punishment had been used as early as the Kamakura period.
Known in Japanese as , crucifixion was used in Japan before and during the Tokugawa Shogunate.
Several related crucifixion techniques were used.
Petra Schmidt, in "Capital Punishment in Japan", writes:
In 1597 twenty-six Christian Martyrs were nailed to crosses at Nagasaki, Japan.
Among those executed were Saints Paulo Miki, Philip of Jesus and Pedro Bautista, a Spanish Franciscan who had worked about ten years in the Philippines.
The executions marked the beginning of a long history of persecution of Christianity in Japan, which continued until its decriminalization in 1871.
Crucifixion was used as a punishment for prisoners of war during World War II.
Ringer Edwards, an Australian prisoner of war, was crucified for killing cattle, along with two others.
He survived 63 hours before being let down.
========,3,Burma.
In Burma, crucifixion was a central element in several execution rituals.
Felix Carey, a missionary in Burma from 1806–12 wrote the following:
========,3,Europe.
During World War I, there were persistent rumors that German soldiers had crucified a Canadian soldier on a tree or barn door with bayonets or combat knives.
The event was initially reported in 1915 by Private George Barrie of the 1st Canadian Division.
Two investigations, one a post-war official investigation, and the other an independent investigation by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, concluded that there was no evidence to support the story.
However, British documentary maker Iain Overton in 2001 published an article claiming that the story was true, identifying the soldier as Harry Band.
Overton's article was the basis for a 2002 episode of the Channel 4 documentary show "Secret History".
It has been reported that crucifixion was used in several cases against the German civil population of East Prussia when it was occupied by Soviet forces at the end of the Second World War.
========,2,Modern use.
Crucifixion is still used as a rare method of execution in some countries.
The punishment of crucifixion ("șalb") imposed in Islamic law is variously interpreted as exposure of the body after execution, crucifixion followed by stabbing in the chest, or crucifixion for three days, survivors of which are allowed to live.
========,3,Legal execution.
Several people have been executed by crucifixion in Saudi Arabia in the 2000s, although on occasion they were first beheaded and then crucified.
Most recently, in March 2013, a robber was set to be executed by being crucified for three days.
However, the method was changed.
Ali Mohammed Baqir al-Nimr was arrested in 2012 when he was 17 years old for taking part in an anti-government protests in Saudi Arabia during the Arab Spring.
In May 2014, Ali al-Nimr was sentenced to be publicly beheaded and crucified.
Theoretically, crucifixion is still one of the Hadd punishments in Iran.
If a crucified person were to survive three days of crucifixion, that person would be allowed to live.
Execution by hanging is described as follows: "In execution by hanging, the prisoner will be hung on a hanging truss which should look like a cross, while his (her) back is toward the cross, and (s)he faces the direction of Mecca [in Saudi Arabia], and his (her) legs are vertical and distant from the ground."
Sudan's penal code, based upon the government's interpretation of shari'a, includes execution followed by crucifixion as a penalty.
When, in 2002, 88 people were sentenced to death for crimes relating to murder, armed robbery, and participating in ethnic clashes, Amnesty International wrote that they could be executed by either hanging or crucifixion.
Crucifixion is a legal punishment in the United Arab Emirates.
========,3,Jihadism.
On 5 February 2015 The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) reported that the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has committed "several cases of mass executions of boys, as well as reports of beheadings, crucifixions of children and burying children alive."
On 30 April 2014 Islamic extremists carried out a total of seven public executions in Raqqa, northern Syria.
The pictures, originally posted to Twitter by a student at Oxford University, were retweeted by a Twitter account owned by a known member of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) causing major media outlets to incorrectly attribute the crucifixions to the militant group.
In most of these cases of "crucifixion" the victims are shot first then their bodies are displayed but there have also been reports of "crucifixion" preceding shootings or decapitations as well as a case where a man was said to have been "crucified alive for eight hours" with no indication of whether he died.
========,3,Other terrorist incidents.
The human rights group Karen Women Organization documented a case of Tatmadaw forces crucifying several Karen villagers in 2000 in the Dooplaya District in Burma's Kayin State.
On January 22, 2014, an anti-government activist and member of AutoMaidan was kidnapped by unknown parties and tortured for a week.
His captors kept him in the dark, beat him, cut off a piece of his ear, and nailed him to a cross.
His captors ultimately left him in a forest outside Kiev after forcing him to confess to being an American spy and accepting money from the US Embassy in Ukraine to organize protests against then-President Viktor Yanukovych.
In 2015, a video surfaced depicting members of the Azov Battalion, an official regiment of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, allegedly crucifying a separatist rebel of Novorossiya and burning him alive.
Therein they declare, "all the separatists, traitors of Ukraine and militia fighters [sic] will be treated the same."
The Azov Battalion is associated with neo-Nazism and flaunts symbols associated with the SS such as the wolfsangel and black sun.
They allegedly sent the video to the pro-Russian hacktivist organization CyberBerkut, which responded by threatening to take no Ukrainian Army soldiers or militia fighters as prisoners from then on.
The authenticity of this video is unconfirmed.
========,2,As a devotional practice.
The Catholic Church frowns on self-crucifixion as a form of devotion: "Penitential practices leading to self-crucifixion with nails are not to be encouraged."
Nevertheless, the practice is not unknown.
In the Philippines, some Catholics are voluntarily, non-lethally crucified for a limited time on Good Friday to imitate the sufferings of Christ.
Pre-sterilised nails are driven through the palm of the hand between the bones, while there is a footrest to which the feet are nailed.
Rolando del Campo, a carpenter in Pampanga, vowed to be crucified every Good Friday for 15 years if God would carry his wife through a difficult childbirth, while in San Pedro Cutud, Ruben Enaje has been crucified 27 times.
The Church in the Philippines has repeatedly voiced disapproval of crucifixions and self-flagellation, while the government has noted that it cannot deter devotees.
The Department of Health insists that participants in the rites should have tetanus shots and that the nails used should be sterilized.
In other cases, a crucifixion is only simulated within a passion play, as in the ceremonial re-enactment that has been performed yearly in the town of Iztapalapa, on the outskirts of Mexico City, since 1833, and in the more famous Oberammergau Passion Play.
Also, since at least the mid-19th century, a group of flagellants in New Mexico, called "Hermanos de Luz" ("Brothers of Light"), have annually conducted reenactments of Christ's crucifixion during Holy Week, in which a penitent is tied—but not nailed—to a cross.
