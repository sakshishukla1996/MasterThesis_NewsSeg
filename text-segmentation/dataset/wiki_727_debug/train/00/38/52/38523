========,1,preface.
In the administrative divisions of France, the department (, ) is one of the three levels of government below the national level ("territorial collectivities"), between the administrative regions and the commune.
There are 97 departments in metropolitan France, and 5 overseas departments, which are also classified as regions.
Departments are further subdivided into 334 arrondissements, themselves divided into cantons; the last two have no autonomy, and are used for the organisation of police, fire departments, and sometimes, elections.
Each department is administered by an elected body called a departmental council ("conseil départemental" (sing.
), "conseils départementaux" (plur.)).
From 1800 to April 2015, they were called "general councils" ("conseil général" (sing.
), "conseils généraux" (plur.)).
Each council has a president.
Their main areas of responsibility include the management of a number of social and welfare allowances, of junior high school ("collège") buildings and technical staff, and of local roads and school and rural buses, and a contribution to municipal infrastructures.
Local services of the State administration are traditionally organised at departmental level, where the prefect represents the government; however, regions have gained importance in this regard since the 2000s, with some department-level services merged into region-level services.
The departments were created in 1790 as a rational replacement of Ancien Régime provinces with a view to strengthen national unity; the title "department" is used to mean a part of a larger whole.
Almost all of them were named after physical geographical features (rivers, mountains, or coasts), rather than after historical or cultural territories which could have their own loyalties.
The division of France into departments was a project particularly identified with the French revolutionary leader the Abbé Sieyès, although it had already been frequently discussed and written about by many politicians and thinkers.
The earliest known suggestion of it is from 1764 in the writings of d'Argenson.
They have inspired similar divisions in many countries, some of them former French colonies.
Most French departments are assigned a two-digit number, the "Official Geographical Code", allocated by the "Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques".
Some overseas departments have a three-digit number.
The number is used, for example, in the postal code, and was until recently used for all vehicle registration plates.
While it is common for residents to use the numbers to refer to their own department or a neighbouring one, more distant departments are generally referred to by their names, as few people know the numbers of all the departments.
For example, inhabitants of Loiret might refer to their department as "the 45".
In 2014, President François Hollande proposed to abolish departmental councils by 2020, which would have maintained the departments as administrative divisions, and to transfer their powers to other levels of governance.
This reform project has since been abandoned.
========,2,History.
The first French territorial departments were proposed in 1665 by Marc-René d'Argenson to serve as administrative areas purely for the Ponts et Chaussées (Bridges and Highways) infrastructure administration.
Before the French Revolution, France gained territory gradually through the annexation of a mosaic of independent entities.
By the close of the Ancien Régime, it was organised into provinces.
During the period of the Revolution, these were dissolved, partly in order to weaken old loyalties.
The modern departments, as all-purpose units of the government, were created on 4 March 1790 by the National Constituent Assembly to replace the provinces with what the Assembly deemed a more rational structure.
Their boundaries served two purposes:

The old nomenclature was carefully avoided in naming the new departments.
Most were named after an area's principal river or other physical features.
Even Paris was in the department of Seine.
The number of departments, initially 83, was increased to 130 by 1809 with the territorial gains of the Republic and of the First French Empire (see Provinces of the Netherlands for the annexed Dutch departments).
Following Napoleon's defeats in 1814-1815, the Congress of Vienna returned France to its pre-war size; the number of departments was reduced to 86, as three of the original departments had been split.
In 1860, France acquired the County of Nice and Savoy, which led to the creation of three new departments.
Two were added from the new Savoyard territory, while the department of "Alpes-Maritimes" was created from Nice and a portion of the "Var" department.
The 89 departments were given numbers based on their alphabetical order.
The department of "Bas-Rhin" and parts of "Meurthe", "Moselle", "Vosges" and "Haut-Rhin" were ceded to the German Empire in 1871, following France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War.
A small part of "Haut-Rhin" remained French, however, and became known as the "Territoire de Belfort", and the remaining parts of "Meurthe" and "Moselle" were merged into a new "Meurthe-et-Moselle" department.
When France regained the ceded departments after World War I, the "Territoire de Belfort" was not re-integrated into Haut-Rhin.
In 1922, it became France's 90th department.
Likewise, the Lorraine departments were not changed back to their original boundaries, and a new "Moselle" department was created in the regained territory, with slightly different boundaries from the pre-war department of the same name.
The re-organisation of Île-de-France (1968) and the division of Corsica (1975) added six more departments, raising the total to 96.
Counting the five overseas departments (French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Réunion and Mayotte) the total comes to 101 departments.
In 2011, the overseas collectivity of Mayotte became the 101st department.
In 2015, the Urban Community of Lyon split from Rhône and form the Metropolitan Lyon as the 1st metropolitan department, 97th department in Metropolitan France, and 102nd department in the Republic.
========,2,General characteristics.
The departmental seat of government is known as the prefecture ("préfecture") or "chef-lieu de département" and is generally a town of some importance roughly at the geographical centre of the department.
This was determined according to the time taken to travel on horseback from the periphery of the department.
The goal was for the prefecture to be accessible on horseback from any town in the department within 24 hours.
The prefecture is not necessarily the largest city in the department: for instance, in Saône-et-Loire department the capital is Mâcon, but the largest city is Chalon-sur-Saône.
Departments may be divided into arrondissements.
The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture ("sous-préfecture") or "chef-lieu d'arrondissement".
Each department is administered by a departmental council ("conseil départemental"), an assembly elected for six years by universal suffrage, with the president of the council as executive of the department.
Before 1982, the executive of a department was the prefect ("préfet") who represents the Government of France in each department and is appointed by the President of France.
The prefect is assisted by one or more sub-prefects ("sous-préfet") based in the subprefectures of the department.
The departments are further divided into communes, governed by municipal councils.
As of 2013, there were 36,681 communes in France.
In the overseas territories, some communes play a role at departmental level.
Paris, the country's capital city, is a commune as well as a department.
In continental France (metropolitan France, excluding Corsica), the median land area of a department is , which is two-and-a-half times the median land area of the ceremonial counties of England and the preserved counties of Wales and slightly more than three-and-half times the median land area of a county of the United States.
At the 2001 census, the median population of a department in continental France was 511,012 inhabitants, which is 21 times the median population of a U.S. county, but less than two-thirds of the median population of a ceremonial county of England and Wales.
Most of the departments have an area of between 4,000 and 8,000 km², and a population between 320,000 and 1 million.
The largest in area is Gironde (10,000 km²), while the smallest is the city of Paris (105 km²).
The most populous is Nord (2,550,000) and the least populous is Lozère (74,000).
The departments are numbered: their two-digit numbers appear in postal codes, in INSEE codes (including "social security numbers") and on vehicle number plates.
Initially, the numbers corresponded to the alphabetical order of the names of the departments, but several changed their names, so the correspondence became less exact.
There is no number 20, but 2A and 2B instead, for Corsica.
Corsican postal codes for addresses in both departments do still start with 20.
The two-digit code "98" is used by Monaco.
Together with the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code FR, the numbers form the ISO 3166-2 country subdivision codes for the metropolitan departments.
The overseas departments get three digits—e.g.
971 for Guadeloupe (see table below).
Originally, the relationship between the departments and the central government was left somewhat ambiguous.
While citizens in each department elected their own officials, the local governments were subordinated to the central government, becoming instruments of national integration.
By 1793, however, the revolutionary government had turned the departments into transmission belts for policies enacted in Paris.
With few exceptions, the departments had this role until the early 1960s.
========,3,Party political preferences.
These maps cannot be used as a useful resource of voter preferences, because Departmental Councils are elected on a two-round system, which drastically limits the chances of fringe parties, if they are not supported on one of the two rounds by a moderate party.
After the 1992 election, the left had a majority in only 21 of the 100 departments; after the 2011 election, the left dominated 61 of the 100 departments.
(Mayotte only became a department after the election.)

========,2,Future.
The removal of one or more levels of local government has been discussed for some years; in particular, the option of removing the departmental level.
Frédéric Lefebvre, spokesman for the UMP, said in December 2008 that the fusion of the departments with the regions was a matter to be dealt with soon.
This was soon refuted by Édouard Balladur and Gérard Longuet, members of the Committee for the reform of local authorities, known as the Balladur Committee.
In January 2008, the Commission for freeing French development, known as the Attali Commission, recommended that the departmental level of government should be eliminated within ten years.
Nevertheless, the Balladur Committee has not retained this proposition and does not advocate the disappearance of the departments, but simply "favors the voluntary grouping of departments", which it suggests also for the regions, with the aim of reducing the number of regions to 15.
This committee advocates, on the contrary, the suppression of the cantons.

========,4,Departments of Algeria (Départements d'Algérie).
Unlike the rest of French-controlled Africa, Algeria was divided into overseas departments from 1848 until its independence in 1962.
These departments were supposed to be "assimilated" or "integrated" to France sometime in the future.
========,4,Departments of the Napoleonic Empire in Europe.
There are a number of former departments in territories conquered by France during the French Revolution and Napoleonic Empire that are now not part of France:
