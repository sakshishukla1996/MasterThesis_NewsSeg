========,2,Function and presentation.
The Fon people of Benin believe the rainbow snake Ayida-Weddo, created to serve Nana Buluku, held up the heavens.
The creature had a twin personality as the red part of the rainbow was male, while the blue part was female.
She is portrayed as a narrow green snake.
Like Dambala, she lives in the sky as well as in all the trees, springs, pools, and rivers.
In some West African mythology, Mawu the creator sent down Adanhu and Yewa from the sky with the rainbow serpent Ayida-Weddo.
"In the beginning there was a vast serpent, whose body formed seven thousand coils beneath the earth, protecting it from descent into the abysmal sea.
Then the titanic snake began to move and heave its massive form from the earth to envelop the sky.
It scattered stars in the firmament and wound its taught flesh down the mountains to create riverbeds.
it shot thunderbolts to the earth to create the sacred thunderstones.
From its deepest core it released the sacred waters to fill the earth with life.
As the first rains fell, a rainbow encompassed the sky and Danbala took her, Ayida Wedo, as his wife.
The spiritual nectar that they created reproduces through all men and women as milk and semen.
The serpent and the rainbow taught humankind the link between blood and life, between menstruation and birth, and the ultimate Vodou sacrament of blood sacrifice."
She is syncretised with the Catholic figure of Our Lady of Immaculate Conception.
