========,2,Politics.
Wetzel County was a rarity among northern West Virginia counties in supporting secession at the Virginia Secession Convention, and thus consequently reliably supporting Democratic presidential candidates for the next ninety years.
The first Republican to carry Wetzel County was Herbert Hoover in 1928 due to anti-Catholicism, but the county afterwards stayed Democratic until 1952.
Since that time Wetzel County has followed the politics of West Virginia: a Democratic-leaning state up to the Clinton Era, after which de-unionization and latent racism has caused extremely rapid trends toward the Republican Party.
========,2,Local lore.
In the mid-to-late 19th century a band similar to the James Gang of legend existed that was known as the Jennings Gang.
A number of robberies and murders were accounted to this gang.
They were known to be located near the head of Doolin Run near Tarpan Ridge.
The home they occupied was found to have an escape tunnel that had been used to escape capture on several occasions.
A local group of citizens known as the "Redmen" ultimately cornered the gang at this home and a number of the members were killed.
A detailed description exists in the Wetzel County History written approximately in 1900.
The oldest oil well location known is of one drilled on Long Run near Doolin Run which reached oil at a depth about 360 ft. Wetzel County has a long history in the Oil and Gas producing industry.
During the Oil boom of the 19th century it is reported that the Proctor Creek watershed had 12 saloons and numerous livery/hotels to accommodate the hundreds of logging and oil field workers.
