The governor of Michigan is the head of the executive branch of Michigan's state government and serves as the commander-in-chief of the state's military forces.
The governor has a duty to enforce state laws; the power to either approve or veto appropriation bills passed by the Michigan Legislature; the power to convene the legislature; and the power to grant pardons, except in cases of impeachment.
He or she is also empowered to reorganize the executive branch of the state government.
Michigan was originally part of French and British holdings, and administered by their colonial governors.
After becoming part of the United States, numerous areas of what is today Michigan were originally part of the Northwest Territory, Indiana Territory and Illinois Territory, and administered by territorial governors.
In 1805, the Michigan Territory was created, and five men served as territorial governors, until Michigan was granted statehood in 1837.
Forty-eight individuals have held the position of state governor.
The first female governor, Jennifer Granholm, was elected in 2003.
After Michigan gained statehood, governors held the office for a two-year term, until the 1963 Michigan Constitution changed the term to four years.
The number of times an individual could hold the office was unlimited until a 1992 constitutional amendment imposed a lifetime term limit of two four-year governorships.
The longest-serving governor in Michigan's history was William Milliken, who was promoted from lieutenant governor after Governor George W. Romney resigned, then was elected to three further successive terms.
========,2,Governors.
Michigan was part of colonial New France until the Treaty of 1763 transferred ownership to the Kingdom of Great Britain.
During this time, it was governed by the Lieutenants General of New France until 1627, the Governors of New France from 1627 to 1663, and the Governors General of New France until the transfer to Great Britain.
The 1783 Treaty of Paris ceded the territory that is now Michigan to the United States as part of the end of the Revolutionary War, but British troops were not removed from the area until 1796.
During the British ownership, their governors administrated the area as part of the Canadian territorial holdings.
Prior to becoming its own territory, parts of Michigan were administered by the governors of the Northwest Territory, the governors of the Indiana Territory and the governors of the Illinois Territory.
On June 30, 1805, the Territory of Michigan was created, with General William Hull as the first territorial governor.
========,3,Governors of the State of Michigan.
Michigan was admitted to the Union on January 26, 1837.
The original 1835 Constitution of Michigan provided for the election of a governor and a lieutenant governor every 2 years.
The fourth and current constitution of 1963 increased this term to four years.
There was no term limit on governors until a constitutional amendment effective in 1993 limited governors to two terms.
Should the office of governor become vacant, the lieutenant governor becomes governor, followed in order of succession by the Secretary of State and the Attorney General.
Prior to the current constitution, the duties of the office would devolve upon the lieutenant governor, without that person actually becoming governor.
The term begins at noon on January 1 of the year following the election.
Prior to the 1963 constitution, the governor and lieutenant governor were elected through separate votes, allowing them to be from different parties.
In 1963, this was changed, so that votes are cast jointly for a governor and lieutenant governor of the same party.
