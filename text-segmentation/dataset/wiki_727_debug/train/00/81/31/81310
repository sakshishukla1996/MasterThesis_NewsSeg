Shelby County is a county of the U.S. state of Alabama.
As of the 2010 census the population was 195,085.
The county seat is Columbiana.
The county is named in honor of Isaac Shelby, Governor of Kentucky from 1792 to 1796 and again from 1812 to 1816.
Shelby County is included in the Birmingham-Hoover, AL Metropolitan Statistical Area.
========,2,History.
Shelby County was established on February 7, 1818, and it was named for the Revolutionary War hero and the first Governor of Kentucky, Isaac Shelby.
Beginning in 1820, the first county seat was located at Shelbyville.
This settlement, long defunct, was located within the modern city limits of Pelham.
The first courthouse was built of logs.
The seat was moved to Columbia, now Columbiana, in 1826.
Initially housed in an old school building, a new brick courthouse building was completed in 1854.
It is now known as the Old Shelby County Courthouse and houses the Shelby County Museum and Archives.
The current limestone courthouse was built from 1905–06, at a cost of $300,000.
Shelby County has a long history in agriculture, and since about 1990, it has become an important location for growing soybeans, which has exceeded cotton as the most important crop grown there.
Shelby County was the home of an early inland waterway, the Coosa River, and it was also the location of a very early east-west railroad in Alabama that connected Atlanta, Georgia, with locations to its west.
Shelby County was also crossed by an early north-south railroad, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, that connected Louisville, Nashville, Decatur, Birmingham, and Montgomery.
With the advent of the automobile and the truck, Shelby County was soon crossed from north to south by U.S. Highway 31, the major one that followed the same route as the Louisville and Nashville Railroad did.
(All U.S.
Highways, with "one" as their last of two digits are major north-south ones: e.g.
U.S. 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, and 71.)
The eastern part of Shelby County was later crossed by U.S. Highway 231 and U.S. 280 Decades later on, Shelby County was crossed by Interstate Highway 65.
Hence, an important ingredient in the eventual growth of Shelby County has been its ready access to modern systems of transportation.
Interstate 65 and U.S. Highway 31 have long provided strong connections between Shelby county and the more populous Jefferson County directly to its north, leading to suburban development in towns such as Pelham, Helena, Alabaster, and Chelsea.
========,2,Geography.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (3.0%) is water.
Parts of Shelby County are crossed by the southernmost extensions of the Appalachian Mountains, such as Oak Mountain and Double Oak Mountain.
However, large parts of Shelby County are much flatter, giving good land for farms and pastures.
Shelby County also has lowlands along two rivers, and one large man-made reservoir, Lay Lake, which also borders Coosa, Talladega and Chilton counties.
Most of Shelby County is drained either by the Cahaba River, which flows along the northern edge of the county, and then to the southwest, or by the Coosa River, whose valley includes the eastern end of the county.
These are both important rivers in Alabama.
Much farther south, both the Cahaba River and the Coosa River flow into the Alabama River, and thence to the Gulf of Mexico.
To be more precise, the Coosa River and the Tallapoosa River flow together at Wetumpka, Alabama, to form the Alabama River, and then the Cahaba River is a tributary to that one farther to the west.
Waxahatchee Creek, a major tributary of the Coosa River, forms the southeastern portion of the border between Shelby County and Chilton County.

========,2,Politics.
Prior to the early 1980s, elected officials serving or representing Shelby County were all affiliated with the Democratic Party.
Most of the rapid transition from the Democratic Party dominance to a complete reversal, with Republicans in control of all but a couple of offices, took place during the years between 1984 and 1992.
It was not, however, until the election of 2010, and specifically the results in Alabama House of Representatives District 42, that Republicans held every elected office with jurisdiction or residency (or both) in Shelby County (excludes municipal elected officials, who are elected on a non-partisan basis).
The Shelby County Republican Party (Alabama), under the official direction of the Republican Executive Committee of Shelby County, Alabama, is the affiliate of the Alabama Republican Party in Shelby County, and is the identity by which its governing body is known.
In 2013, the County was the plaintiff in "Shelby County v. Holder", which struck down portions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 as unconstitutional.
