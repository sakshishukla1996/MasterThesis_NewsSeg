========,1,preface.
An exponent is a phonological manifestation of a morphosyntactic property.

There are several kinds of exponents:
***LIST***.
========,2,Identity.
The identity exponent is both simple and common: it has no phonological manifestation at all.

An example in English:<br> WANT + → wanted
========,2,Reduplication.
Reduplication is the repetition of part of a word.
An example in Sanskrit:<br> DA ("give") + + + + + → dadaami (the da at the beginning is from reduplication, a characteristic of class 3 verbs in Sanskrit)
========,2,Internal modification.
There are several types of internal modification.
An internal modification may be segmental, meaning it changes a sound in the root.
An example in English:<br> STINK + = stank (i becomes a) An internal modification might be a suprasegmental modification.
An example would be a change in pitch or stress.
An example of the latter in English (acute accent indicates stress):<br> RECÓRD + = récord
========,2,Subtraction.
Subtraction is the removal of a sound or a group of sounds.
An example in French:<br> OEUF /œf/ ("egg") + = œufs /ø/ (final f is lost)
