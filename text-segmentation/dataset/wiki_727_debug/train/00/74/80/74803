========,1,preface.
A doughnut or donut (both: or ; see spelling differences) is a type of fried dough confectionery or dessert food.
The doughnut is popular in many countries and prepared in various forms as a sweet snack that can be homemade or purchased in bakeries, supermarkets, food stalls, and franchised specialty outlets.
Doughnuts are usually deep fried from a flour dough, and typically either ring-shaped or without a hole, and often filled.
Other types of batters can also be used, and various toppings and flavorings are used for different types, such as sugar, chocolate, or maple glazing.
In addition to flour, doughnuts may also include such ingredients as water, leavening, eggs, milk, sugar, oil, shortening, natural flavors or artificial flavors.
The two most common types are the "ring doughnut" and the "filled doughnut"—which is injected with fruit preserves, cream, custard, or other sweet fillings.
A small spherical piece of dough may be cooked as a "doughnut hole".
Once doughnuts have been fried, they may be glazed with a sugar icing, spread with icing or chocolate, or topped with powdered sugar or sprinkles or fruit.
Other shapes include rings, balls, and flattened spheres, as well as ear shapes, twists and other forms.
Doughnut varieties are also divided into cake and yeast-risen type doughnuts.
Donuts are often accompanied by coffee when they are purchased at doughnut shops or fast food restaurants.
========,2,Shapes.
========,3,Rings.
Ring doughnuts are formed by one of two methods: by joining the ends of a long, skinny piece of dough into a ring, or by using a doughnut cutter, which simultaneously cuts the outside and inside shape, leaving a doughnut-shaped piece of dough and a doughnut hole (from the dough removed from the center).
This smaller piece of dough can be cooked and served as a "doughnut hole" or added back to the batch to make more doughnuts.
A disk-shaped doughnut can also be stretched and pinched into a torus until the center breaks to form a hole.
Alternatively, a doughnut depositor can be used to place a circle of liquid dough (batter) directly into the fryer.
There are two types of ring doughnuts, those made from a yeast-based dough for raised doughnuts, or those made from a special type of cake batter.
Yeast-raised doughnuts contain about 25% oil by weight, whereas cake doughnuts' oil content is around 20%, but they have extra fat included in the batter before frying.
Cake doughnuts are fried for about 90 seconds at approximately 190 °C (374 °F) to 198 °C (388 °F), turning once.
Yeast-raised doughnuts absorb more oil because they take longer to fry, about 150 seconds, at 182 °C (359 °F) to 190 °C (374 °F).
Cake doughnuts typically weigh between 24 g and 28 g (0.85 oz to 0.99 oz), whereas yeast-raised doughnuts average 38 g (1.34 oz) and are generally larger, and taller (due to rising) when finished.
========,4,Topping.
After frying, ring doughnuts are often topped.
"Raised doughnuts" are generally covered with a glaze (icing).
"Cake doughnuts" can also be glazed, or powdered with confectioner's sugar, or covered with cinnamon and granulated sugar.
They are also often topped with cake frosting (top-side only) and sometimes sprinkled with coconut, chopped peanuts, or sprinkles (also called jimmies).
========,3,Holes.
Doughnut holes are small, bite-sized doughnuts that were traditionally made from the dough taken from the center of ring doughnuts.
Before long, doughnut sellers saw the opportunity to market "holes" as a novelty and many chains offer their own variety, some with their own brand names such as "Munchkins" from Dunkin' Donuts and "Timbits" from Tim Hortons.
Traditionally, doughnut holes are made by frying the dough removed from the center portion of the doughnut.
Consequently, they are considerably smaller than a standard doughnut and tend to be spherical.
Similar to standard doughnuts, doughnut holes may be topped with confections, such as glaze or powdered sugar.
Originally, most varieties of doughnut holes were derivatives of their ring doughnut (yeast-based dough or cake batter) counterparts.
However, doughnut holes can also be made by dropping a small ball of dough into hot oil from a specially shaped nozzle or cutter.
This production method has allowed doughnut sellers to produce bite-sized versions of non-ring doughnuts, such as filled doughnuts, fritters and Dutchies.
========,3,Filled.
The "filled doughnut" is a flattened sphere injected with fruit preserves, cream, custard, or other sweet fillings, and often dipped into powdered sugar or topped off with frosting.
Common varieties include the Boston cream, coconut, key lime, and jelly.
========,3,Other shapes.
Others include the fritter and the Dutchie, which are usually glazed.
These have been available on Tim Hortons' doughnut menu since the chain's inception in 1964, and a 1991 "Toronto Star" report found out that these two were the chain's most popular type of fried dough in Canada.
There are many other specialized doughnut shapes such as old-fashioned, bars or Long Johns (a rectangular shape), or with the dough twisted around itself before cooking.
In the northeast U.S., bars and twists are usually referred to as crullers.
Another is the beignet, which is square-shaped, covered with powdered sugar.
========,2,History.
========,3,Possible origins.
Doughnuts have a disputed history.
One theory suggests they were invented in North America by Dutch settlers, and in the 19th century, doughnuts were sometimes referred to as one kind of "oliekoek" (a Dutch word literally meaning "oil cake"), a "sweetened cake fried in fat."
Hanson Gregory, an American, claimed to have invented the ring-shaped doughnut in 1847 aboard a lime-trading ship when he was 16 years old.
Gregory was dissatisfied with the greasiness of doughnuts twisted into various shapes and with the raw center of regular doughnuts.
He claimed to have punched a hole in the center of dough with the ship's tin pepper box, and to have later taught the technique to his mother.
"Smithsonian Magazine" states that his mother, Elizabeth Gregory, "made a wicked deep-fried dough that cleverly used her son's spice cargo of nutmeg and cinnamon, along with lemon rind," and "put hazelnuts or walnuts in the center, where the dough might not cook through", and called the food 'doughnuts'.
According to anthropologist Paul R. Mullins, the first cookbook mentioning doughnuts was an 1803 English volume which included doughnuts in an appendix of American recipes.
By the mid-19th century, the doughnut looked and tasted like today's doughnut, and was viewed as a thoroughly American food.
Another theory on their origin came to light in 2013, appearing to predate all previous claims, when a recipe for "dow nuts" was found in a book of recipes and domestic tips written in 1800 by the wife of Baron Thomas Dimsdale, the recipe being given to the dowager Baroness by an acquaintance who transcribed for her the cooking instructions of a local delicacy, the "Hertfordshire nut".
========,3,Etymology.
========,4,"Dough nut".
The earliest known recorded usage of the term dates to an 1808 short story describing a spread of "fire-cakes and dough-nuts."
Washington Irving's reference to "doughnuts" in 1809 in his "History of New York" is more commonly cited as the first written recording of the term.
Irving described "balls of sweetened dough, fried in hog's fat, and called doughnuts, or" olykoeks"."
These "nuts" of fried dough might now be called doughnut holes.
"Doughnut" is the more traditional spelling, and still dominates outside the US.
At present, "doughnut" and the shortened form "donut" are both pervasive in American English.
========,4,"Donut".
The first known printed use of "donut" was in "Peck's Bad Boy and his Pa" by George W. Peck, published in 1900, in which a character is quoted as saying, "Pa said he guessed he hadn't got much appetite, and he would just drink a cup of coffee and eat a donut."
According to John T. Edge ("Donuts, an American passion" 2006) the alternative spelling "donut" was invented when the New York–based Display Doughnut Machine Corporation abbreviated the word to make it more pronounceable by the foreigners they hoped would buy their automated doughnut making equipment.
The donut spelling also showed up in a "Los Angeles Times" article dated August 10, 1929 in which Bailey Millard jokingly complains about the decline of spelling, and that he "can't swallow the 'wel-dun donut' nor the ever so 'gud bred'."
The interchangeability of the two spellings can be found in a series of "National Donut Week" articles in "The New York Times" that covered the 1939 World's Fair.
In four articles beginning October 9, two mention the "donut" spelling.
Dunkin' Donuts, which was so-named in 1950, following its 1948 founding under the name Open Kettle (Quincy, Massachusetts), is the oldest surviving company to use the "donut" variation; other chains, such as the defunct Mayflower Doughnut Corporation (1931), did not use that spelling.
According to the Oxford Dictionary while "doughnut" is used internationally, the spelling "donut" is American.
The spelling "donut" remained rare until the 1950s, and has since grown significantly in popularity; this growth in use has possibly been influenced by the spread of Dunkin' Donuts.
========,3,National Doughnut Day.
National Doughnut Day, also known as National Donut Day, celebrated in the United States of America, is on the first Friday of June each year, succeeding the Doughnut Day event created by The Salvation Army in 1938 to honor those of their members who served doughnuts to soldiers during World War I.
About 250 Salvation Army volunteers went to France.
Because of the difficulties of providing freshly baked goods from huts established in abandoned buildings near the front lines, the two Salvation Army volunteers (Ensign Margaret Sheldon and Adjutant Helen Purviance) came up with the idea of providing doughnuts.
These are reported to have been an "instant hit", and "soon many soldiers were visiting The Salvation Army huts".
Margaret Sheldon wrote of one busy day: "Today I made 22 pies, 300 doughnuts, 700 cups of coffee."
Soon, the women who did this work became known by the servicemen as "Doughnut Dollies".
========,3,Pink boxes.
In the US, especially in Southern California, fresh donuts sold by the dozen at local donut shops are typically packaged in generic pink boxes.
This phenomenon can be attributed to Ted Ngoy and Ning Yen, refugees of the Cambodian genocide who transformed the local donut shop industry.
They proved so adept at the business and in training fellow Chinese Cambodian refugees to follow suit that these local donut shops soon dominated native franchises such as Winchell's Donuts.
Initially desiring boxes of a lucky red color rather than the standard white, Ngoy and Yen settled on a cheaper, leftover pink stock.
Owing to the success of their business, the color soon became a recognizable standard.
Due to the locality of Hollywood, the pink boxes frequently appeared as film and television props and were thus transmitted into popular culture.
========,2,Science.
========,3,Cake vs yeast style.
Yeast doughnuts and cake doughnuts contain most of the same ingredients, however, their structural differences arise from the type of flour and leavening agent used.
In cake doughnuts, cake flour is used, and the resulting doughnut is denser because cake flour has a relatively low gluten content of about 7 to 8 percent.
In yeast doughnuts, a flour with a higher protein content of about 9 to 12 percent is used, resulting in a doughnut that is lighter and more airy.
In addition, yeast doughnuts utilize yeast as a leavening agent.
Specifically, “Yeast cells are thoroughly distributed throughout the dough and begin to feed on the sugar that is present… carbon dioxide gas is generated, which raises the dough, making it light and porous.” Whereas this process is biological, the leavening process in cake doughnuts is chemical.
In cake doughnuts, the most common leavening agent is baking powder.
Baking powder is essentially “baking soda with acid added.
This neutralizes the base and produces more CO according to the following equation: NaHCO + H → Na + HO + CO”
========,3,Physical structure.
The physical structure of the doughnut is created by the combination of flour, leavening agent, sugar, eggs, salt, water, shortening, milk solids, and additional components.
The most important ingredients for creating the dough network are the flour and eggs.
The main protein in flour is gluten, which is overall responsible for creating elastic dough because this protein acts as “coiled springs.” The gluten network is composed of two separate molecules named glutenin and gliadin.
Specifically, "the backbone of the gluten network likely consists of the largest glutenin molecules, or subunits, aligned and tightly linked to one another.
These tightly linked glutenin subunits associate more loosely, along with gliadin, into larger gluten aggregates."
The gluten strands than tangle and interact with other strands and other molecules, resulting in networks that provide the elasticity of the dough.
In mixing, the gluten is developed when the force of the mixer draws the gluten from the wheat endosperm, allowing the gluten matrix to trap the gas cells.
========,3,Molecular composition.
Eggs function as emulsifiers, foaming agents, and tenderizers in the dough.
The egg white proteins, mainly Ovulblumins, “function as structure formers.
Egg solids, chiefly the egg white solids combined with the moisture in the egg, are considered structure-forming materials that help significantly to produce proper volume, grain, and texture.” The egg yolk contributes proteins, fats, and emulsifiers to the dough.
Emulsifying agents are essential to doughnut formation because they prevent the fat molecules from separating from the water molecules in the dough.
The main emulsifier in egg yolk is called lecithin, which is a phospholipid.
“The fatty acids are attracted to fats and oils (lipids) in food, while the phosphate group is attracted to water.
It is this ability to attract both lipids and water that allow phospholipids such as lecithin to act as emulsifiers.” The proteins from both the egg yolk and the egg whites contribute to the structure of the dough through a process called coagulation.
When heat is applied to the dough, the egg proteins will begin to unfold, or denature, and then form new bonds with one another, thus creating a gel-like network that can hold water and gas.
Shortening is responsible for providing tenderness and aerating the dough.
In terms of its molecular structure, “a typical shortening that appears solid [at room temperature] contains 15-20% solids and, hence, 80-85% liquid oil…this small amount of solids can be made to hold all of the liquid in a matrix of very small, stable, needlelike crystals (beta-prime crystals).” This crystalline structure is considered highly stable due to how tightly its molecules are packed.
The sugar used in baking is essentially sucrose, and besides imparting sweetness in the doughnut, sugar also functions in the color and tenderness of the final product.
Sucrose is a simple carbohydrate whose structure is made up of a glucose molecule bound to a fructose molecule.
Milk is utilized in the making of doughnuts, but in large scale bakeries, one form of milk used is nonfat dry milk solids.
These solids are obtained by removing most of the water from skim milk with heat, and this heat additionally denatures the whey proteins and increases the absorption properties of the remaining proteins.
The ability of the casein and whey proteins to absorb excess water is essential to prolonging the doughnut's freshness.
The major whey protein in the nonfat milk solids is known as beta-lactoglobulin, and a crucial feature of its structure is that there exists a single sulfhydryl group that is protected by the alpha helix, and when heating of the milk solids occurs, these groups participate in disulfide exchanges with other molecules.
This interchange prevents the renaturation of the whey proteins.
If the crosslinking of the sulfide groups does not occur, the whey proteins can rebond and weaken the gluten network.
Water is a necessary ingredient in the production of doughnuts because it activates the other ingredients, allowing them to perform their functions in building the doughnut's structure.
For example, sugar and salt crystals must be dissolved in order for them to act in the dough, whereas larger molecules, such as the starches or proteins, must be hydrated in order for them to absorb moisture.
Another important consideration of water is its degree of hardness, which measures the amount of impurities in the water source.
Pure water consists of two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen, but water used in baking often is not pure.
Baker’s salt (NaCl) is usually used as an ingredient due to its high purity, whereas the salts in water are derived from varying minerals.
As an ingredient, “salt is added to enhance the flavour of cakes and breads and to ‘toughen up’ the soft mixture of fat and sugar.” If relatively soft water is being used, more salt should be added in order to strengthen the gluten network of the dough, but if not enough salt is added during the baking process, the flavor of the bread will not be appealing to consumers.
========,3,Health effects.
Doughnuts are unhealthy, some less so than others.
According to "Prevention Magazine", doughnuts provide essential nutrients such as thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin, along with beneficial fiber; but, they are high in sugar and calories.
Steps to improve the healthiness of doughnuts include removing trans fats.
========,3,Dough rheology.
An important property of the dough that effects the final product is the dough's rheology.
This property measures the ability of the dough to flow.
It can be represented by the power law equation: τ=k.D^n where τ is the tangentic stress, k is the viscosity coefficient, D is the shear rate, and n is the flow index.
Many factors affect dough rheology including the type of ingredients, the amount of the ingredients, or the force applied during mixing.
Dough is usually described as a viscoelastic material, meaning that its rheology depends on both the viscosity and the elasticity.
The viscosity coefficient and the flow index are unique to the type of dough being analyzed, while the tangentic stress and the shear rate are measurements obtained depending on the type force being applied to the dough.
========,2,Regional variations.
========,3,Africa.
========,4,South Africa.
In South Africa, an Afrikaans variation known as the "koeksister" is popular.
Another variation, similar in name, is the Cape Malay "koesister" being soaked in a spiced syrup and coated in coconut.
It has a texture similar to more traditional doughnuts as opposed to the Afrikaans variety.
A further variation is the "vetkoek", which is also dough deep fried in oil.
It is served with mince, syrup, honey or jam.
========,4,Tunisia.
In Tunisia, traditional pastries similar to doughnuts are "yo-yos".
They come in different versions both as balls and in shape of doughnuts.
They are deep-fried and covered in a honey syrup or a kind of frosting.
Sesame seeds are also used for flavor and decoration along with orange juice and vanilla.
========,3,Asia.
========,4,China.
A few sweet, doughnut-style pastries are regional in nature.
Cantonese cuisine features an oval-shaped pastry called "ngàuhleisōu" (牛脷酥, lit.
"ox-tongue pastry" due to its tongue-like shape).
A spherical food called" saa1 jung" (沙翁) which is also similar to cream puff, but denser in texture (doughnut-like texture) with sugar sprinkled on top, is normally available in Cantonese restaurants in the dim sum style.
An oilier Beijing variant of this called 高力豆沙, "gaoli dousha", is filled with red bean paste; originally, it was made with egg white instead of dough.
Many Chinese cultures make a chewy doughnut known as "shuangbaotai" (雙包胎), which consists of two conjoined balls of dough.
Chinese restaurants in the US sometimes serve small fried pastries similar to doughnut holes, served with condensed milk as a sauce.
Chinese cuisine features long, deep-fried doughnut sticks that are often quite oily, hence their name in Mandarin, "yóutiáo" (油條, lit.
oil strips.
); in Cantonese, this doughnut-style pastry is called "yàuhjagwái" (油炸鬼, "ghosts fried in oil").
These pastries are not sweet and are often served with congee, a traditional rice porridge.
========,4,India.
In India, an old fashioned sweet called gulgula is made of sweetened flour balls deep fried.
It may or may not use a leavening agent.
In India, there are a couple of unrelated donut shaped food items.
A savory, fried, ring-shaped snack called a "vada" is often referred to as the Indian doughnut.
The "vada" is made from "dal", lentil or potato flours rather than wheat flour.
In North India, it is in the form of a bulging disc called "dahi-vada", and is soaked in curd, sprinkled with spices and sliced vegetables, and topped with a sweet and sour chutney.
In South India, a vada is eaten with "sambar" and a coconut chutney.
Sweet pastries similar to old-fashioned doughnuts called "badushahi" and "jalebi" are also popular.
"Balushahi", also called "badushah", is made from flour, deep fried in clarified butter, and dipped in sugar syrup.
Unlike a donut, Balushahi is dense.
A "Balushahi" is ring-shaped, but the hole in the center does not go all the way through.
"Jalebi", which is typically pretzel-shaped, is made by deep frying batter in oil and soaking it in sugar syrup.
A variant of "jalebi", called "imarti", is shaped with a small ring in the center around which a geometric pattern is arranged.
Along with these Indian variants, American variants of doughnuts are also available with American brands such as Krispy Kreme and Dunkin' Donuts setting up retail outlets in India, as well as local brands such as Mad Over Donuts and the Donut Baker.
========,4,Iran.
The Persian "zoolbia" and "bamiyeh" are fritters of various shapes and sizes coated in a sugar syrup.
Doughnuts are also made in the home in Iran, referred to as doughnuts, even in the singular.
========,4,Israel.
Jelly doughnuts, known as "sufganiyah" (סופגניה, pl.
sufganiyot סופגניות) in Israel, have become a traditional Hanukkah food in the recent era, as they are cooked in oil, associated with the holiday account of the miracle of the oil.
Traditional "sufganiyot" are filled with red jelly and topped with icing sugar.
However, many other varieties exist, with some being filled with "dulce de leche" (particularly common after the South American aliyah early in the 21st century).
========,4,Japan.
In Japan, "an-doughnut" (あんドーナッツ, "bean paste doughnut") is widely available at bakeries.
"An-doughnut" is similar to Germany's "Berliner", except it contains red azuki bean paste.
Mister Donut is one of the most popular doughnut chains in Japan.
Native to Okinawa is a spheroid pastry similar to doughnuts called "sata andagi".
========,4,Malaysia.
"Kuih keria" is a hole doughnut made from boiled sweet potato that is mashed.
The sweet potato mash is shaped into rings and fried.
The hot doughnut is then rolled in granulated sugar.
The result is a doughnut with a sugar-crusted skin.
========,4,Nepal.
"Sel roti" is a Nepali homemade, ring-shaped, rice doughnut prepared during Tihar, the widely celebrated Hindu festival in Nepal.
A semiliquid dough is usually prepared by adding milk, water, sugar, butter, cardamom, and mashed banana to rice flour, which is often left to ferment for up to 24 hours.
A "sel roti" is traditionally fried in "ghee".
========,4,Pakistan.
Doughnuts are available at most bakeries across Pakistan.
The Navaz Sharif variety, available mainly in the city of Karachi, is covered in chocolate and filled with cream, similar to a Boston cream.
Doughnuts can readily be found at the many Dunkin' Donuts branches spread across Pakistan.
========,4,Philippines.
Local varieties of doughnuts sold by peddlers and street vendors throughout the Philippines are usually made of plain well-kneaded dough, deep-fried in refined coconut oil and sprinkled with refined (not powdered or confectioner's) sugar.
Native doughnut recipes include the "shakoy", "kumukunsi", and "binangkal".
"Shakoy" or "siyakoy" from the Visayas islands (also known as "lubid-lubid" in the northern Philippines) uses a length of dough twisted into a distinctive rope-like shape before being fried.
The preparation is almost exactly the same as doughnuts, though there are variants made from glutinous rice flour.
The texture can range from soft and fluffy, to sticky and chewy, to hard and crunchy.
They are sprinkled with white sugar, but can also be topped with sesame seeds or caramelized sugar.
"Kumukunsi" is a similar native doughnut from the Maguindanao people.
It is made with rice flour, duck eggs, and sugar that is molded rope-like strands and then fried in a loose spiral.
They have the taste and consistency of creamy pancakes.
"Binangkal" are simple fried dough balls covered in sesame seeds.
========,4,Taiwan.
In Taiwan, "shuāngbāotāi" (雙胞胎, lit.
twins) is two pieces of dough wrapped together before frying.
========,4,Thailand.
In Thailand, a popular breakfast food is Pa Thong Ko, also known as Thai Donuts, a version of the Chinese Yiu Ja Guoy/Youtiao.
Often sold from food stalls in markets or by the side of the road, these doughnuts are small sometimes X-shaped and sold by the bag full.
They are often eaten in the morning with hot Thai tea.
========,4,Vietnam.
Vietnamese varieties of doughnuts include "bánh tiêu"," bánh cam", and "bánh rán".
"Bánh tiêu" is a sesame-topped, deep-fried pastry that is hallow.
It can be eaten alone or cut in half and served with "bánh bò", a gelatinous cake, placed inside the pastry.
"Bánh cam" is from Southern Vietnam and is a ball-shaped, deep-fried pastry coated entirely in sesame seeds and inside of which contains a mung bean paste filling.
"Bánh rán" is from Northern Vietnam and is similar to "bánh cam"; however, the difference is that "bánh rán "is covered with a sugar glaze after being deep-fried and its mung bean paste filling includes a jasmine essence.
========,3,Europe.
========,4,Austria.
In Austria, doughnut equivalents are called "Krapfen".
They are especially popular during Carneval season (Fasching), and do not have the typical ring shape, but instead are solid and usually filled with apricot jam (traditional) or vanilla cream ("Vanillekrapfen").
A second variant, called "Bauernkrapfen", probably more similar to doughnuts, are made of yeast dough, and have a thick outside ring, but are very thin in the middle.
========,4,Belgium.
In Belgium, the "smoutebollen" in Dutch, or "croustillons" in French, are similar to the Dutch kind of "oliebollen", but they usually do not contain any fruit, except for apple chunks sometimes.
They are typical carnival and fair snacks and are coated with powdered sugar.
========,4,Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia and Serbia.
Doughnuts similar to the Berliner are prepared in the northern Balkans, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia and Serbia ("pokladnice" or "krofne").
They are also called "krofna", "krafna" or "krafne", a name derived from the Austrian "Krapfen" for this pastry.
In Croatia, they are especially popular during Carneval season and do not have the typical ring shape, but instead are solid.
Traditionally, they are filled with jam (apricot or plum).
However, they can be filled with vanilla or chocolate cream.
Another types of doughnuts are "uštipci" and "fritule".
========,4,Czech Republic.
There are Czech Republic "American" style doughnuts, but before they were solid shape and filled with jelly (strawberry or peach).
The shape is similar to doughnuts in Germany or Poland.
They are called Kobliha (Koblihy in plural).
They may be filed with nougat or with vanilla custard.
There are now many fillings; cut in half or non-filled knots with sugar and cinnamon on top.
========,4,Denmark.
In Denmark, doughnuts exist in their "American" shape, and these can be obtained from various stores, e.g.
McDonald's and most gas stations.
The Berliner, however, is also available in bakeries.
========,4,Finland.
in Finland, a sweet doughnut is called a "munkki" (the word also means "monk") and are commonly eaten in cafés and cafeteria restaurants.
They are sold cold and are sometimes filled with jam (U.S. "jelly") or a vanilla sauce.
A ring doughnut is also known as "donitsi".
A savory form of doughnut is the meat doughnut (in Finnish "lihapiirakka", or literally "meat pie").
Being made of doughnut mixture and deep fried the end product is more akin to a savory doughnut than any "pie" known in the English speaking world.
========,4,Germany.
In parts of Germany, the doughnut equivalents are called "Berliner" (sg.
and pl.
), but not in the capital city of Berlin itself and neighboring areas, where they are called "Pfannkuchen" (which is often found misleading by people in the rest of Germany, who use the word Pfannkuchen to describe a pancake, which is also the literal translation of it).
In middle Germany, they are called "Kreppel" or "Pfannkuchen".
In southern Germany, they are also called "Krapfen" and are especially popular during Carnival season ("Karneval"/"Fasching") in southern and middle Germany and on New Year's Eve in northern Germany.
"Berliner" do not have the typical ring shape, but instead are solid and usually filled with jam, while a ring-shaped variant called "Kameruner" is common in Berlin and eastern Germany.
"Bismarcks" and "Berlin doughnuts" are also found in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Switzerland and the US.
Today, American style doughnuts are also available in Germany, but are less popular than their native counterparts.
========,4,Greece.
In Greece, there is a doughnut-like snack, called "loukoumas (λουκουμάς)", which is spherical and soaked in honey syrup.
It is often served with sprinkled cinnamon and grated walnuts or sesame seeds.
========,4,Hungary.
Fánk is a sweet traditional Hungarian cake.
The most commonly used ingredients are: flour, yeast, butter, egg yolk, a little bit of rum, a sniff of salt, milk and oil to deep fry with.
After the pastry has risen for approximately 30 minutes the result is an extreme light doughnut-like pastry.
Fánk is mostly served with powdered sugar and lekvar.
It is supposed that Fánk pastry is of the same origin as German Berliner, Dutch oliebol, and Polish pączki.
========,4,Iceland.
In Iceland "kleinuhringur" (pl.
"kleinuhringir" and "kleinuhringar") are a type of old Icelandic cuisine which resembles doughnuts.
The Berliner and many other kinds of doughnuts can only be found on one day of the year and that is on a holiday called "Bolludagur" or in other words Doughnut Day.
========,4,Lithuania.
In Lithuania, a kind of doughnut called "spurgos" is widely known.
Some spurgos are similar to Polish pączki, but some specific recipes, such as cottage cheese doughnuts ("varškės spurgos"), were invented independently.
========,4,Netherlands.
In the Netherlands, "oliebollen", referred to in cookbooks as "Dutch doughnuts", are a type of fritter, with or without raisins or currants, and usually sprinkled with powdered sugar.
Variations of the recipe contain slices of apple or other fruits.
They are traditionally eaten as part of New Year celebrations.
========,4,Norway.
In Norway, smultring is the prevailing type of doughnut traditionally sold in bakeries, shops, and stalls, however the American-style doughnuts are widely available in larger supermarkets, McDonald's restaurants, 7-elevens and bakeries.
The Berliner is more common than the US doughnut, and sold in most supermarkets and bakeries alongside smultring doughnuts.
========,4,Poland.
In Poland and parts of the U.S. with a large Polish community, like Chicago and Detroit, the round, jam-filled doughnuts eaten especially—though not exclusively—during the Carnival are called pączki ().
Pączki have been known in Poland at least since the Middle Ages.
Jędrzej Kitowicz has described that during the reign of the Augustus III under influence of French cooks who came to Poland at that time, pączki dough fried in Poland has been improved, so that pączki became lighter, spongier, and more resilient.
========,4,Romania.
The Romanian dessert "gogoși" are fried dough balls similar to filled doughnuts.
They are stuffed with chocolate, jam, cheese and other combinations and may be dusted with icing sugar.
========,4,Russia.
In Russia and the other Post-Soviet countries, "ponchiki" (, plural form of пончик, "ponchik") or "pyshki" (, especially in St. Petersburg) are a very popular sweet doughnut, with many fast and simple recipes available in Russian cookbooks for making them at home as a breakfast or coffee pastry.
In Ukraine and Belarus they are called "pampushky" ().
========,4,Slovenia.
In Slovenia, a jam-filled doughnut known as "krofi", is very popular.
It is the typical sweet during Carnival time, but is to be found in most bakeries during the whole year.
The most famous "krofi" come from the village of Trojane in central Slovenia, and are originally filled with apricot jam filling.
========,4,Spain.
In Spain, there are two different types of doughnuts.
The first one, simply called "donuts" (in reference to the most famous commercial brand name for this type of food) or "berlinesas" (a more traditional name), refer to the American-style doughnut, that is, a deep fried, sweet, soft, ring of flour dough.
The second type of doughnut is a traditional pastry called "rosquilla", made of fermented dough and which is fried or baked in an oven.
