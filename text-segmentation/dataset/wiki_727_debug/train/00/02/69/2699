========,1,preface.
Aberavon (Welsh: "Aberafan") is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.
It returns one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system.
It is represented by Stephen Kinnock of the Labour Party.
========,2,History.
The constituency was created for the 1918 general election by a division of the Swansea District.
With the exception of the first term, it has always been held by the Labour Party.
Ramsay MacDonald, who became Labour's first Prime Minister in 1924, held the seat from 1922 to 1929.
Its current MP, Stephen Kinnock, is the son of Neil Kinnock, who was Labour leader and Leader of the Opposition from 1983 to 1992.
It is one of the most consistently safe seats for Labour; since the end of the Second World War, the Labour candidate has always won Aberavon with a majority at least 33%, and with the exception of 2015, the Labour candidate has also always won an overall majority of the vote in the seat.
In 2015, Kinnock only won 48.9% of the vote in Aberavon, against a surge in the vote for the UKIP candidate; however, in 2017, Kinnock's voteshare rose by 19.2 percentage points, the biggest increase in the Labour vote in the seat's history, and his majority increased to 50.4%, the highest for an Aberavon MP since 2001.
