The telephone system in Andorra, including mobile, data and Internet is operated exclusively by the Andorran national telecommunications company, Andorra Telecom, formerly known as Servei de Telecomunicacions d'Andorra (STA), which operates with the brand SOM.
The same company is also responsible for managing the technical infrastructure and national broadcasting networks for radio and television, both analogue and digital.
