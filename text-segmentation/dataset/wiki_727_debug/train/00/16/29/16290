========,1,preface.
In physics, jerk, also known as jolt, surge, or lurch, is the rate of change of acceleration; that is, the derivative of acceleration with respect to time, and as such the second derivative of velocity, or the third derivative of position.
Jerk is a vector, and there is no generally used term to describe its scalar magnitude (more precisely, its norm, e.g.
"speed" as the norm of the velocity vector).
According to the result of dimensional analysis of jerk, [length/time], the SI units are m/s (or m·s); jerk can also be expressed in standard gravity per second ("g"/s).
========,2,Expressions.
Jerk can be formulated in any of the following equivalent ways:
where There is no universal agreement on the symbol for jerk, but ***formula*** is commonly used.
Newton's notation for the time derivative (***formula***) is also applied.
The fourth derivative of position, equivalent to the first derivative of jerk, is jounce.
Because of involving third derivatives, in mathematics differential equations of the form are called "jerk equations".
It has been shown that a jerk equation, which is equivalent to a system of three first-order ordinary non-linear differential equations, is in a mathematically well defined sense the minimal setting for solutions showing chaotic behaviour.
This motivates mathematical interest in "jerk systems".
Systems involving a fourth or higher derivative are accordingly called "hyperjerk systems".
========,2,Physiological effects and human perception.
The smooth movement and also the rest state of an alert human body is achieved by balancing the forces of several antagonistic muscles which are controlled across neural paths by the brain (for directed movement) or sometimes across reflex arcs.
In balancing some given force (holding or pulling up a weight, e.g.)
the postcentral gyrus establishes a control loop to achieve this equilibrium by adjusting the muscular tension according to the sensed position of the actuator.
If the load changes faster than the current state of this control loop is capable of supplying a suitable, adaptive response, the balance cannot be upheld, because the tensioned muscles cannot relax or build up tension fast enough and overshoot in either direction, until the neural control loop manages to take control again.
Of course the time to react is limited from below by physiological bounds and also depends on the attention level of the brain: an "expected" change will be stabilized faster than a "sudden" drop or increase of load.
So passengers in transportation, who need this time to adapt to stress changes and to adjust their muscle tension, or else suffer conditions such as whiplash, can be safely subjected both only to a less than maximum acceleration, and to a less than maximum jerk, so to avoid loss of control over their body motion thereby endangering their physical integrity.
Even where occupant safety is not an issue, excessive jerk may result in an uncomfortable ride on elevators, trams, and the like, and engineers expend considerable design effort to minimize "jerky motion".
Since forces, changing at a suitable rate in time (that is, "suitable" jerk) are the cause of vibrations, and vibrations significantly impair the quality of transportation, there is good reason to simply "minimize" jerk in transportation vehicles.
As an everyday example, driving in a car can show effects of acceleration and jerk.
The more experienced drivers accelerate smoothly, but beginners provide a "jerky" ride.
***LIST***.
For some remarks on how the human perception of various motions is organized in the proprioceptors, the vestibular organ and by visual impressions, and how to deceive it, see the article on motion simulators.
========,2,Forces and path derivatives.
========,3,Position ***formula*** itself, zeroth derivative.
The most prominent force ***formula*** associated with the "position" of a particle relates through Hooke's law to the "rigid" stiffness ***formula*** of a spring:
This is a force opposing the increase in displacement.
========,3,Higher derivatives.
In classical mechanics of rigid bodies there are "no forces" associated with the higher derivatives of the path, nevertheless not only the physiological effects of jerk, but also oscillations and deformation propagation along and in non-ideally rigid bodies, require various techniques for controlling motion to avoid the resulting destructive forces.
It is often reported that NASA in designing the Hubble Telescope not only limited the jerk in their requirement specification, but also the next higher derivative, the jounce.
For a recoil force on accelerating "charged" particles emitting radiation, which is proportional to their jerk and the square of their charge, see the Abraham–Lorentz force.
A more advanced theory, applicable in a relativistic and quantum environment, accounting for self-energy is provided in Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory.
========,2,In elastically deformable matter.
A force/acceleration acting on an elastically deformable mass will affect a deformation which depends on its stiffness and the acceleration applied.
If the change of this force is slow, the jerk is small, and the propagation of this deformation through the body may be considered instantaneously compared to the change in acceleration.
The distorted body acts as if it were in a quasi-static regime.
It is the common thread that only a changing force, i.e.
a non-zero jerk, can cause mechanical (or on a charged particle: electromagnetic) waves to be radiated.
So for non-zero to high jerk a shock wave and its propagation through the body is to be considered.
The left picture shows the propagation of a deformation as a compressional, plane wave through an elastically deformable material.
For angular jerk the deformation waves are arranged circularly and cause shear stress as shown in the adjacent picture, which also might cause other modes of vibration.
As usual with waves, one has to consider their reflections along all boundaries and the emerging interference patterns, i.e.
destructive as well as constructive interference, which may lead to exceeding boundaries of structural integrity.
As a rough estimate the deformation waves result in vibrations of the whole device and, generally, vibrations cause noise, wear, and, especially in resonance cases, even disruption.
The picture to the left shows a massive top bending the elastic pole, to which it is connected, to the left, when the bottom block is accelerated to the right.
When the block stops accelerating, the top on the pole will start a (damped) oscillation under the regime of the stiffness of the pole.
This could make plausible, how a bigger (periodic) jerk might excite a bigger amplitude of the oscillations, because any small oscillations are damped before they get reinforced by another amplitude of the shock wave.
One can also argue that a "steeper" slope of the acceleration, i.e.
a bigger jerk, excites bigger wave components in the shockwave with higher frequencies, belonging to higher Fourier coefficients, and so an increased probability of exciting a resonant mode.
As a general rule, to reduce the amplitude of excited stress waves, causing vibrations, any motion of massive parts has to be shaped by limiting the jerk, i.e.
making the acceleration continuous and keep its slopes as flat as possible.
Since the described effects are almost not amenable to abstract models anymore, the various suggested algorithms for reducing vibrations include still higher derivatives such as the jounce or suggest continuous regimes not only for the acceleration, but also for the jerk.
One concept is e.g.
shaping the acceleration and deceleration sinusoidal with zero-acceleration in between (see the profile to the right), making the speed look sinusoidal with constant maximal speed, too.
The jerk however will remain discontinuous at the points when the acceleration enters and leaves its zero-phases.
========,2,In the geometric design of roads and tracks.
The principles of geometric design apply to the jerk oriented orthogonally to the path of motion, considering the centripetal acceleration, whereas the velocity along the path is assumed to be constant, and so the tangential jerk is zero.
Any change in curvature of the path implies non-zero jerk, arising from purely geometric reasons.
To avoid the unbounded (centripetal) jerk when moving from a straight path into a curve or vice versa, track transition curves are constructed, which limit the jerk by gradually increasing the centripetal acceleration, i.e.
the curvature, to the value that belongs to the radius of the circle and the speed of travel.
The theoretical optimum is achieved by the Euler spiral, which linearly increases the acceleration, i.e., constant jerk.
As a design rule a maximum value of 0.5 m/s and for convenience purposes a value of 0.35 m/s are recommended in railway design.
The picture shows a piece of an Euler spiral leading as track transition curve from a straight line to an arc of a circle.
In the real scenario the plane of the track is inclined in the course of the curve and so also this vertical acceleration of the necessary lifting of the center of mass of the rail car has to be considered to minimize the wear on the embankment and the tracks by following a slightly different curve.
This has been patented as the "Wiener Kurve" (Viennese Curve).
Roller coasters are of course also subject to these design considerations, when rolling into a loop.
The acceleration values range up to 4g in this environment and it would not be possible to ride loopings without track transitions, as well as one cannot smoothly drive along a figure eight consisting of circles.
Any S-shaped curve must contain some jerk-reducing transition.
========,2,In motion control.
In motion control the focus is on straight linear motion, where the need is to move a system from one steady position to another (point-to-point motion).
So effectively, the jerk resulting from tangential acceleration is under control.
Prominent applications are elevators in people transportation, and the support of tools in machining.
It is reported that most passengers rate a vertical jerk of 2.0 m/s in a lift ride as acceptable, 6.0 m/s as intolerable and for a hospital environment 0.7 m/s is suggested.
In any case, limiting jerk is considered essential for riding convenience.
ISO 18 738 defines how to measure elevator ride quality with respect to jerk, acceleration, vibrations and noise, but does not venture into defining what are different levels of elevator ride quality.
Achieving the shortest possible transition time, thereby not exceeding given limit magnitudes for speed, acceleration, and jerk, will result in a third-order motion profile, with quadratic ramping and de-ramping phases in the velocity, as illustrated below:
This motion profile consists of up to seven segments defined by the following:
***LIST***.
The time allotted to segment 4, concerning constant velocity, is to be varied to suit the distance between the two positions.
If the initial and final positions are so close together that a complete omission of this 4. segment does not suffice, the segments 2. and 6. with constant acceleration are equally reduced and the limit of speed would not be reached in this variant of the profile.
If also this does not reduce the crossed distance sufficiently, in a next step the ramping segments 1., 3., 5., and 7. are to be shortened by an equal amount and the limit of acceleration is not reached, also.
There are also other strategies to design a motion profile, e.g.
minimizing the square of the jerk for a given transition time, to be selected according to the varying applications in machines, people movers, chain hoists, automotive industries, robot design, and many more.
For a sinusoidal-shaped acceleration profile, with sinusoidal-shaped speed and bounded jerk also, see above.
========,3,In manufacturing.
Jerk is also important to consider in manufacturing processes.
Rapid changes in acceleration of a cutting tool can lead to premature tool wear and result in uneven cuts.
This is why modern motion controllers include jerk limitation features.
In mechanical engineering, jerk is considered, in addition to velocity and acceleration, in the development of cam profiles because of tribological implications and the ability of the actuated body to follow the cam profile without chatter.
Jerk must be often considered when the excitation of vibrations is a concern.
A device that measures jerk is called a "jerkmeter".
