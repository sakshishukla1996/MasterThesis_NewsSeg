(See "Babylon 5' "s use of the Internet.)

========,2,Early life.

Straczynski is a graduate of San Diego State University (SDSU), having earned a BA with a double major in psychology and sociology (with minors in philosophy and literature).
While at SDSU, he wrote for the student newspaper, "The Daily Aztec," at times penning so many articles that the paper was jokingly referred to as the "Daily Joe".
Straczynski resides in the Los Angeles area.
========,2,Career.
========,3,1970s–1980s.
========,4,Early work.
Straczynski began writing plays, having several produced at Southwestern College and San Diego State University before publishing his adaptation of "Snow White" with Performance Publishing.
Several other plays were produced around San Diego, including "The Apprenticeship" for the Marquis Public Theater.
During the late 1970s, Straczynski also became the on-air entertainment reviewer for KSDO-FM and wrote several radio plays before being hired as a scriptwriter for the radio drama "Alien Worlds".
He also produced his first television project in San Diego, "Marty Sprinkle" for KPBS-TV as well as worked on the XETV-TV project "Disasterpiece Theatre".
He worked as a journalist for the "Los Angeles Times" as a special San Diego correspondent and also worked for "San Diego Magazine" and "The San Diego Reader," and wrote for the "Los Angeles Herald-Examiner", the "Los Angeles Reader, TV-Cable Week," and 'People' magazine"."
Straczynski wrote "The Complete Book of Scriptwriting" for "Writer's Digest."
Published in 1982, the book is often used as a text in introductory screenwriting courses, and is now in its third edition.
He and Kathryn M. Drennan, whom he met at San Diego State, moved to Los Angeles on April 1, 1981.
They would marry in 1983, and separate in 2002.
He spent five years from 1987 to 1992 co-hosting the "Hour 25" radio talk show on KPFK-FM Los Angeles with Larry DiTillio.
During his tenure, he interviewed such luminaries as John Carpenter, Neil Gaiman, Ray Bradbury, Harlan Ellison and other writers, producers, actors and directors.
In 2000, Straczynski returned to radio drama with "The City of Dreams" for scifi.com.
Straczynski is the author of three horror novels—"Demon Night", "Othersyde", and "Tribulations"—and nearly twenty short stories, many of which are collected in two compilations—"Tales from the New Twilight Zone" and "Straczynski Unplugged".
========,4,Work in animation.
Straczynski was a fan of the cartoon "He-Man and the Masters of the Universe".
He wrote a spec script in 1984 and sent it directly to Filmation.
They purchased his script, bought several others, and hired him on staff.
During this time he became friends with Larry DiTillio, and when Filmation produced the He-Man spinoff "", they both worked as story editors on the show.
However, Filmation refused to give them credit on-screen and Straczynski and DiTillio both left and found work with DIC on "Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors".
Straczynski and DiTillio also worked to create an animated version of "Elfquest" but that project soon fell through when CBS attempted to retool the show to appeal to younger audiences.
While working on "Jayce", Straczynski was hired to come aboard the Len Janson and Chuck Menville project to adapt the movie "Ghostbusters" to an animated version called "The Real Ghostbusters".
When Janson and Menville learned that there was not only a 13-episode order but a 65-episode syndication order as well, they decided that the workload was too much and that they would only work on their own scripts.
DIC head Jean Chalopin asked Straczynski to take on the task of story editing the entire 78-episode block as well as writing his own scripts.
After the show's successful first season, consultants were brought in to make suggestions for the show, including changing Janine to a more maternal character, giving every character a particular "job" (Peter is the funny one, Egon is the smart one, and Winston, the only black character, was to be the driver), and to add kids into the show.
Straczynski left at this point and Janson and Menville took on the story editing job for the second network season.
Straczynski then developed a show called "Spiral Zone" but left after only one script when his concept for the show was drastically altered and took his name off the series, substituting the pseudonym "Fettes Grey" (derived from the names of the grave robbers in "The Body Snatcher").
Straczynski also wrote for "CBS Storybreak", writing an adaptation of Evelyn Sibley Lampman's "The Shy Stegosaurus of Cricket Creek".
========,4,Live action and network shows.
After leaving animation, Straczynski freelanced for "The Twilight Zone" writing an episode entitled ("What Are Friends For"), and for Shelley Duvall's "Nightmare Classics", adaptating "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", which was nominated for a Writer's Guild Award).
Straczynski was then offered the position of story editor on the syndicated live-action science fiction series "Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future".
Straczynski constructed a season long arc with lasting character changes and wrote a third of the scripts himself.
After one season, the toy company Mattel demanded more input into the show, causing Straczynski to quit.
He recommended DiTillio to take over the job as story editor for a second season, but the toy company financing fell through and that season was never produced.
Soon after, the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike began.
Straczynski met Harlan Ellison during this time and would later become friends with him.
After the strike ended, the producers of the new "Twilight Zone" needed to create more episodes to be able to sell the series into syndication with a complete 65-episode package.
They hired Straczynski as executive story editor to fill in the remaining number of needed episodes.
Straczynski wrote many of the scripts himself.
In addition, one episode, "Crazy as a Soup Sandwich", was written by Ellison.
After leaving "Twilight Zone", his agent of the time asked him to pitch for the show "Jake and the Fatman".
Initially wary, Straczynski finally did and was hired on as story editor under Jeri Taylor and David Moessinger.
When Taylor and Moessinger left the show, Straczynski left too as an act of solidarity.
When Moessinger was hired as executive producer for "Murder, She Wrote", he offered Straczynski a job as co-producer.
Straczynski joined "Murder" for two seasons and wrote 7 produced episodes.
Moessinger and Straczynski moved the protagonist, Jessica Fletcher, from the sleepy Maine town of Cabot Cove to New York City to revitalize the show.
The move effectively brought the show back into the top ten from the mid-thirties where it had fallen.
Straczynski made Jessica an instructor in writing and criminology, and he emphasized her role as a working writer, with all the deadlines and problems involved in that profession.
Straczynski also wrote one episode of "Walker, Texas Ranger" for Moessinger between the pilot episode for "Babylon 5" and the start of its first season.
Straczynski wrote an adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" for the Showtime network, which was nominated for a Writer's Guild of America award, and a "Murder, She Wrote" movie, "," which he produced.

In late 1991, Warner Bros. contracted with Straczynski and Doug Netter as partners to produce "Babylon 5" as the flagship program for the new Prime Time Entertainment Network.
Straczynski and Netter hired many of the people from "Captain Power", as well as hiring Ellison as a consultant and DiTillio as a story editor.
"Babylon 5" won two Emmy Awards, back-to-back Hugo Awards, and dozens of other awards.
Straczynski wrote 92 of the 110 episodes, as well as the pilot and five television movies.
The show is a character-driven space opera and features an intentional emphasis on realism in its portrayal of space operations.
It also pioneered extensive use of CGI for its special effects.
"Babylon 5" was produced and broadcast for 5 seasons completing Stracynski's planned story arc.
Its sequel, "Crusade", was produced for the TNT Network, however it ended with only 13 episodes.
Production was halted before the first episode aired.
He wrote the outlines for nine of the canonical "Babylon 5" novels, supervised the three produced "B5" telefilm novelizations ("In the Beginning", "Thirdspace", and "A Call to Arms"), and is the author of four "Babylon 5" short stories published in magazines, not yet reprinted ().

========,4,"Jeremiah".
Straczynski also ran "Jeremiah", loosely based on the Belgian post-apocalyptic comic of the same name, from 2002-2004.
Straczynski ran the series for two seasons but was frustrated with the conflicting directions that MGM and Showtime wanted from the show, and even used the pseudonym "Fettes Grey" for the first time since "Spiral Zone" on one of the scripts.
In the second season, Straczynski decided to leave the show if things did not improve, and the show ended after 2 seasons.
========,4,"Changeling".
Straczynski wrote "Changeling", a psychological drama film based partly on the "Wineville Chicken Coop" kidnapping and murder case in Los Angeles, California.
Directed by Clint Eastwood, produced by Ron Howard, and starring Angelina Jolie, the film premiered in 2008, and subsequently received eight nominations for the BAFTA Award, including a nomination for Best Original Screenplay.
The first draft script was written in eleven days, after Straczynski figured out "how to tell" the story, which ended up being the shooting draft, after Eastwood declined to make any changes.
It was optioned immediately by Howard, who at first intended to direct the film but later stepped down after scheduling conflicts.
At first, Straczynski expressed disbelief at the story, but spent a year researching the case, compiling over six thousands pages of documentation.
Straczynski claimed that 95% of the script's content came from the historical record, and went through the script with Universal's legal department, providing attribution for every scene so the film would be described as "a true story" rather than "based on" one.
