========,1,preface.
The unified atomic mass unit (symbol: u) or dalton (symbol: Da) is a standard unit of mass that quantifies mass on an atomic or molecular scale (atomic mass).
One unified atomic mass unit is approximately the mass of one nucleon (either a single proton or neutron) and is numerically equivalent to 1g/mol.
It is defined as one twelfth of the mass of an unbound neutral atom of carbon-12 in its nuclear and electronic ground state and at rest, and has a value of , or approximately 1.66 yoctograms.
The CIPM has categorised it as a non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI, and whose value in SI units must be obtained experimentally.
The amu without the "unified" prefix is technically an obsolete unit based on oxygen, which was replaced in 1961.
However, many sources still use the term "amu" but now define it in the same way as u (i.e., based on carbon-12).
In this sense, most uses of the terms "atomic mass units" and "amu" today actually refer to unified atomic mass unit.
For standardization a specific atomic nucleus (carbon-12 vs. oxygen-16) had to be chosen because the average mass of a nucleon depends on the count of the nucleons in the atomic nucleus due to mass defect.
This is also why the mass of a proton or neutron by itself is more than (and not equal to) 1 u.
The atomic mass unit is not the unit of mass in the atomic units system, which is rather the electron rest mass ("m").
========,2,History.
The standard atomic weight (or atomic weight) scale has traditionally been a relative value, that is without a unit, with the first relative atomic mass basis suggested by John Dalton in 1803 as H. Despite the initial mass of H being used as the natural unit for relative atomic mass, it was suggested by Wilhelm Ostwald that relative atomic mass would be best expressed in terms of units of 1/16 mass of oxygen ().
This evaluation was made prior to the discovery of the existence of elemental isotopes, which occurred in 1912.
The discovery of isotopic oxygen in 1929 led to a divergence in relative atomic mass representation, with isotopically weighted oxygen (i.e., naturally occurring oxygen relative atomic mass) given a value of exactly 16 atomic mass units (amu) in chemistry, while pure O (oxygen-16) was given the mass value of exactly 16 amu in physics.
The divergence of these values could result in errors in computations, and was unwieldy.
The chemistry amu, based on the relative atomic mass (atomic weight) of natural oxygen (including the heavy naturally-occurring isotopes O and O), was about as massive as the physics amu, based on pure isotopic O.
For these and other reasons, the reference standard for both physics and chemistry was changed to carbon-12 in 1961.
The choice of carbon-12 was made to minimise further divergence with prior literature.
The new and current unit was referred to as the "unified atomic mass unit" u. and given a new symbol, "u," which replaced the now deprecated "amu" that had been connected to the old oxygen-based system.
The Dalton (Da) is another name for the unified atomic mass unit.
Despite this change, modern sources often still use the old term "amu" but define it as u ( of the mass of a carbon-12 atom), as mentioned in the article's introduction.
Therefore, in general, "amu" likely does not refer to the old oxygen standard unit, unless the source material originates from the 1960s or before.
========,2,Terminology.
The unified atomic mass unit and the dalton are different names for the same unit of measure.
As with other unit names such as watt and newton, "dalton" is not capitalized in English, but its symbol Da is capitalized.
With the introduction of the name "dalton", there has been a gradual change towards using that name in preference to the name "unified atomic mass unit":

========,2,Relationship to SI.
The definition of the mole, an SI base unit, was accepted by the CGPM in 1971 as:
***LIST***.
The definition of the mole also determines the value of the universal constant that relates the number of entities to amount of substance for any sample.
This constant is called the Avogadro constant, symbol "N" or "L", and has the value (entities per mole).
Given that the unified atomic mass unit is one twelfth the mass of one atom of carbon-12, meaning the mass of such an atom is 12 u, it follows that there are "N" atoms of carbon-12 in 0.012 kg of carbon-12.
This can be expressed mathematically as
========,2,Usage.
Masses of proteins are often expressed in daltons.
For example, a protein with a molecular weight of has a mass of 64 kDa.
In research and commerce, the degree of polymerization of synthetic polymers is conventionally expressed in daltons.
The US Supreme Court based a major precedent of appellate law on a disputed case of counting daltons for a molecular distribution.
