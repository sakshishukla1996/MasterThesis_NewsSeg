========,1,preface.
In logic and mathematics, or is the truth-functional operator of (inclusive) disjunction, also known as alternation; the "or" of a set of operands is true if and only if "one or more" of its operands is true.
The logical connective that represents this operator is typically written as ∨ or +.
""A" or "B"" is true if "A" is true, or if "B" is true, or if both "A" and "B" are true.
In logic, "or" by itself means the "inclusive" "or", distinguished from an exclusive or, which is false when both of its arguments are true, while an "or" is true in that case.
An operand of a disjunction is called a disjunct.

========,2,Notation.
Or is usually expressed with an infix operator: in mathematics and logic, ∨; in electronics, +; and in most programming languages, |, ||, or or.
In Jan Łukasiewicz's prefix notation for logic, the operator is A, for Polish "alternatywa" (English: alternative).
========,2,Definition.
Logical disjunction is an operation on two logical values, typically the values of two propositions, that has a value of "false" if and only if both of its operands are false.
More generally, a disjunction is a logical formula that can have one or more literals separated only by 'or's.
A single literal is often considered to be a degenerate disjunction.
The disjunctive identity is false, which is to say that the "or" of an expression with false has the same value as the original expression.
In keeping with the concept of vacuous truth, when disjunction is defined as an operator or function of arbitrary arity, the empty disjunction (OR-ing over an empty set of operands) is generally defined as false.
========,2,Symbol.
The mathematical symbol for logical disjunction varies in the literature.
In addition to the word "or", and the formula "A"pq"", the symbol "***formula***", deriving from the Latin word "vel" (“either”, “or”) is commonly used for disjunction.
For example: ""A" ***formula*** "B" " is read as ""A" or "B" ".
Such a disjunction is false if both "A" and "B" are false.
In all other cases it is true.
All of the following are disjunctions:
The corresponding operation in set theory is the set-theoretic union.
========,2,Union.
The membership of an element of an union set in set theory is defined in terms of a logical disjunction: "x" ∈ "A" ∪ "B" if and only if ("x" ∈ "A") ∨ ("x" ∈ "B").
Because of this, logical disjunction satisfies many of the same identities as set-theoretic union, such as associativity, commutativity, distributivity, and de Morgan's laws.
========,2,Natural language.
As with other notions formalized in mathematical logic, the meaning of the natural-language coordinating conjunction "or" is closely related to, but different from the logical "or".
For example, "Please ring me or send an email" likely means "do one or the other, but not both".
On the other hand, "Her grades are so good that she's either very bright or studies hard" does not exclude the possibility of both.
In other words, in ordinary language "or" (even if used with "either") can mean the inclusive or exclusive or.
