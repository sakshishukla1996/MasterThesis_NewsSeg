========,1,preface.
David Director Friedman (born February 12, 1945) is an American economist, physicist, legal scholar, and libertarian theorist.
He is known for his textbook writings on microeconomics and the libertarian theory of anarcho-capitalism, which is the subject of his most popular book, "The Machinery of Freedom".
Besides "The Machinery of Freedom", he has authored several other books and articles, including "Price Theory: An Intermediate Text" (1986), "Law's Order: What Economics Has to Do with Law and Why It Matters" (2000), "Hidden Order: The Economics of Everyday Life" (1996), and "Future Imperfect" (2008).
========,2,Life and work.
David Friedman is the son of economists Rose and Milton Friedman.
He graduated "magna cum laude" from Harvard University in 1965, with a bachelor's degree in chemistry and physics.
He later earned a master's (1967) and a Ph.D. (1971) in theoretical physics from the University of Chicago.
Despite his later career, he never took a class for credit in either economics or law.
He is currently a professor of law at Santa Clara University, and a contributing editor for "Liberty" magazine.
He is an atheist.
His son, Patri Friedman, has also written about libertarian theory and market anarchism, particularly seasteading.
========,3,"The Machinery of Freedom".
In his book "The Machinery of Freedom" (1973), Friedman sketched a form of anarcho-capitalism where all goods and services including law itself can be produced by the free market.
This differs from the version proposed by Murray Rothbard, where a legal code would first be consented to by the parties involved in setting up the anarcho-capitalist society.
Friedman advocates an incrementalist approach to achieve anarcho-capitalism by gradual privatization of areas that government is involved in, ultimately privatizing law and order itself.
In the book, he states his opposition to violent anarcho-capitalist revolution.
He advocates a consequentialist version of anarcho-capitalism, arguing for anarchism on a cost-benefit analysis of state versus no state.
It is contrasted with the natural-rights approach as propounded most notably by economist and libertarian theorist Murray Rothbard.
========,2,Non-academic interests.
Friedman is a longtime member of the Society for Creative Anachronism, where he is known as "Duke Cariadoc of the Bow".
He is known throughout the worldwide society for his articles on the philosophy of recreationism and practical historical recreations, especially those relating to the medieval Middle East.
His work is compiled in the popular "Cariadoc's Miscellany".
He is sometimes credited with founding the largest and longest-running SCA event, the Pennsic War; as king of the Middle Kingdom he challenged the East Kingdom, and later as king of the East accepted the challenge...and lost.
He is a long-time science fiction fan, and has written two fantasy novels, "Harald" (Baen Books, 2006) and "Salamander" (2011).
He has spoken in favor of a non-interventionist foreign policy.
