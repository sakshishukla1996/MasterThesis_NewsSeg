The son of a manager at the Danish Bacon Company, Took was born in Muswell Hill or Wood Green, north London and brought up there during the war, running away from the home in Wisbech to which he had been evacuated.

With his limited education, Took found work as an office boy for a publisher and a cinema projectionist.
During his period of National Service in the RAF in which he played the trumpet, he began performing and later worked as a stand-up comedian, eventually becoming a West End revue performer, working on "For Amusement Only" and "For Adults Only".
In terms of his comedy writing, Took's best work was written in collaboration with Marty Feldman, whom he first met in 1954.
The two men wrote for several television shows in the 1950s and 1960s, including "The Army Game" and its spin-off "Bootsie and Snudge".
He co-wrote "Beyond Our Ken" for two series (1958–1959) with Eric Merriman for BBC Radio before leaving after a disagreement with his fellow writer.
With Marty Feldman he wrote most episodes of "Round the Horne"; the intermittent partnership between them continued until 1974.
In the late 1960s Took became comedy advisor to the BBC and was responsible for bringing together the performers who formed "Monty Python's Flying Circus", before moving to the USA to work briefly on "Rowan and Martin's Laugh In".
He returned to the UK in early 1970, was involved in setting up the BBC series "The Goodies", although he had returned to take up the position of Head of Light Entertainment at London Weekend Television.

"On the Move" (1975–76), a programme linked to a national campaign against adult illiteracy, was written by Took and featured Bob Hoskins and Donald Gee.
He was involved in two further television series on the issue, "Your Move" and "Write Away".
In 1977 Took hosted his own comedy sketch show, "Took and Co".
Also featuring Robin Bailey, Chris Emmett, Andrew Sachs and Gwen Taylor, the series ran for seven episodes late at night on ITV.
In 1979 he became chairman of "The News Quiz" on BBC Radio 4, a role he filled for the next 17 years.
In the same year he became a presenter of "Points of View", staying with the programme for 7½ years.
Took also hosted the BBC Radio 2 comedy panel game "The Impressionists", which included Peter Goodwright, Roger Kitter, David Jason and Dave Evans and, in 1998, the single-season revival of "Twenty Questions" titled "Guess What?".
