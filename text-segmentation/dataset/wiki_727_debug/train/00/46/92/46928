========,1,preface.
Forgotten Realms is a campaign setting for the "Dungeons & Dragons" ("D&D") fantasy role-playing game.
Commonly referred to by players and game designers alike as "The Realms", it was created by game designer Ed Greenwood around 1967 as a setting for his childhood stories.
Several years later, Greenwood brought the setting to the "D&D" game as a series of magazine articles, and the first Realms game products were released in 1987.
Role-playing game products have been produced for the setting ever since, as have various licensed products including sword and sorcery novels, role-playing video game adaptations (including the first massively multiplayer online role-playing game to use graphics), and comic books.
The Forgotten Realms is one of the most popular "D&D" settings, largely due to the success of novels by authors such as R. A. Salvatore and numerous role-playing video games, including "Pool of Radiance" (1988), "Eye of the Beholder" (1991), "Baldur's Gate" (1998), "Icewind Dale" (2000) and "Neverwinter Nights" (2002).
"Forgotten Realms" is the name of a fantasy world setting, described as a world of strange lands, dangerous creatures, and mighty deities, where magic and supernatural phenomena are quite real.
The premise is that, long ago, the Earth and the world of the Forgotten Realms were more closely connected.
As time passed, the inhabitants of planet Earth have mostly forgotten about the existence of that other world – hence the term "Forgotten Realms".
On the original Forgotten Realms logo, which was used until 2000, small runic letters read "Herein lie the lost lands", an allusion to the connection between the two worlds.
========,2,The world.
The focus of the Forgotten Realms setting is the continent of Faerûn, part of the fictional world of Abeir-Toril, usually called simply Toril, an Earth-like planet with many real-world influences.
Unlike Earth, the lands of the Forgotten Realms are not all ruled by the human race: the planet Toril is shared by humans, dwarves, elves, goblins, orcs, and other peoples and creatures.
Technologically, the world of the Forgotten Realms is not nearly as advanced as that of Earth; in this respect, it resembles the pre-industrial Earth of the 13th or 14th century.
However, the presence of magic provides an additional element of power to the societies.
There are several nation states and many independent cities, with loose alliances being formed for defense or conquest.
Trade is performed by ship or horse-drawn vehicle, and manufacturing is based upon cottage industry.
========,3,Geography.
Toril consists of several large continents, including Faerûn, the western part of a continent that was roughly modeled after the Eurasian continent on Earth.
Faerûn was first detailed in the original "Forgotten Realms Campaign Set", published in 1987 by TSR.
The other continents include Kara-Tur, Zakhara, Maztica, and other yet unspecified landmasses.
Kara-Tur, roughly corresponding to ancient East Asia, was later the focus of its own source book "", published in 1988.
There is also a vast subterranean world called the Underdark beneath the surface.
Various products detailing specific areas of Faerûn, such as the 2nd edition "FR13 Anauroch" (1991), "FR15 Gold and Glory" (1992), "FR16 The Shining South" (1993), and "FRS1 The Dalelands" (1993), have been released, and through these much of the continent has been heavily detailed and documented, creating a highly developed setting.
In early editions of the setting, The Realms shared a unified cosmology with various other campaign settings called the Great Wheel.
In this way each of the "Dungeons & Dragons" campaign settings were linked together to form one interwoven world connected by various planes of existence.
With the release of the 2001 "Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting", the setting was given its own distinct and separate cosmological arrangement, with unique planes not explicitly connected to those of the other settings.
========,3,Religion.
Religion plays a large part in the Forgotten Realms, with deities and their followers being an integral part of the world.
They do not have a passive role, but in fact interact directly in mortal affairs, answer prayers, and have their own personal agendas.
All deities must have worshipers to survive, and all mortals must worship a patron deity to secure a good afterlife.
A huge number of diverse deities exist within several polytheistic pantheons; a large number of supplements have documented many of them, some in more detail than others.
Much of the history of The Realms detailed in novels and source books concerns the actions of various deities and The Chosen (mortal representatives with a portion of their deities' power) such as Elminster, Fzoul Chembryl, Midnight (who later became the new embodiment of the goddess of magic, Mystra), and the Seven Sisters.
Above all other deities is Ao, the Overlord.
Ao does not sanction worshipers and distances himself from mortals.
He is single-handedly responsible for the Time of Troubles, or Godswar, as seen in "The Avatar Trilogy".
========,2,History.
========,3,Early years.
Ed Greenwood began writing stories about the "Forgotten Realms" as a child, starting around 1967; they were his "dream space for swords and sorcery stories".
Greenwood came up with the "Forgotten Realms" name from the notion of a multiverse of parallel worlds; Earth is one such world, and the Realms another.
In Greenwood's original conception, the fantastic legends of Earth derive from a fantasy world, the way to which has been lost.
Greenwood discovered the "Dungeons & Dragons" game in 1975, and became a serious role-playing enthusiast with the first "AD&D" game releases in 1978.
The setting became the home of Greenwood's personal campaign.
Greenwood began a Realms campaign in the city of Waterdeep, then started another group known as the Knights of Myth Drannor in Shadowdale.
Greenwood felt that his players' thirst for detail made the Realms what it is: "They want it to seem real, and work on ‘honest jobs’ and personal activities, until the whole thing grows into far more than a casual campaign.
Roleplaying always governs over rules, and the adventures seem to develop themselves."
Greenwood has stated that his own version of the Forgotten Realms, as run in his personal campaign, is much darker than published versions.
Beginning with the periodical's 30th issue in 1979, Greenwood published a series of short articles that detailed the setting in "The Dragon" magazine, the first of which was about a monster known as the "curst".
Greenwood wrote voluminous entries to "Dragon" magazine, using the Realms as a setting for his descriptions of magic items, monsters, and spells.
In 1986, the American game publishing company TSR began looking for a new campaign setting for the "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" game, and assigned Jeff Grubb to find out more about the setting used by Greenwood as portrayed in his articles in "Dragon".
According to Greenwood, Grubb asked him "Do you just make this stuff up as you go, or do you really have a huge campaign world?
"; Greenwood answered "yes" to both questions.
TSR felt that the Forgotten Realms would be a more open-ended setting than the epic Dragonlance setting, and chose the Realms as a ready-made campaign setting upon deciding to publish "AD&D" 2nd Edition.
Greenwood agreed to work on the project, and began working to get the Forgotten Realms officially published.
Greenwood sent TSR a few dozen cardboard boxes stuffed with pencil notes and maps, and sold all rights to the Realms for a token fee.
Greenwood noted that TSR altered his original conception of the Realms being a place that we could travel to from our world, "Concerns over possible lawsuits (kids getting hurt while trying to 'find a gate') led TSR to de-emphasize this meaning".
========,3,"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" 1st edition.
Although the Realms were yet to be an official campaign world, the module "H1: Bloodstone Pass", released in 1985 by TSR, is now considered to be a part of the Forgotten Realms, although it wasn't until module H3 "The Bloodstone Wars" was released that Forgotten Realms became the official setting for the module series.
The first official Forgotten Realms product was Douglas Niles's "Darkwalker on Moonshae", the first book in "The Moonshae Trilogy", which predates the "Forgotten Realms Campaign Set" by one month.
The "Campaign Set" (often referred to as the "Grey Box") was later released in 1987 as a boxed set of two source books ("Cyclopedia of the Realms" and "DM's Sourcebook of the Realms") and four large maps, designed by Greenwood in collaboration with author Jeff Grubb.
The set introduced the campaign setting and explained how to use it, and reserved space on the map for SSI's Gold Box computer role-playing games set in the Forgotten Realms.
The Forgotten Realms became an instant hit.
The compilation module "Desert of Desolation" was reworked to fit into the Forgotten Realms.
The module "N5: Under Illefarn" bears the "Forgotten Realms" logo on the cover, as do the two modules released in 1988, "H4: The Throne of Bloodstone" and "I14: Swords of the Iron Legion".

In 1992, the game was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System.
Several supplements to the original boxed set were released under the first edition rules, including FR1 "Waterdeep and the North" and FR2 "Moonshae" in 1987, and FR3 "Empires of the Sands", FR4 "The Magister", FR5 "The Savage Frontier", FR6 "Dreams of the Red Wizards", and REF5 "Lords of Darkness" in 1988.

"Ruins of Adventure", a module based on the computer game "Pool of Radiance", was released in 1988.
The boxed set "" was released in 1988, giving details of the lands of Kara-Tur which had previously appeared in the 1986 book "Oriental Adventures", and were now officially placed in the Forgotten Realms world.
The same year, the module "OA5: Mad Monkey vs. the Dragon Claw" was released for the Kara-Tur setting as a Forgotten Realms product.
In 1989, DC Comics began publishing a series of Forgotten Realms comics written by Jeff Grubb.
Each issue contained twenty-six pages, illustrated primarily by Rags Morales and Dave Simons.
Twenty-five issues were published in total, with the last being released in 1991.
A fifty-six page annual "Forgotten Realms Comic Annual #1: Waterdhavian Nights", illustrated by various artists, was released in 1990.

An eponymous module, based on the role-playing video game "Curse of the Azure Bonds", was released in 1989, as was "The Avatar Trilogy" series of novels, consisting of "Shadowdale", "Tantras", and "Waterdeep" that detailed the storyline which became known as the "Time of Troubles".
A series of module adaptations for these novels ("Shadowdale", "Tantras", and "Waterdeep") were released in the same year, along with the "Hall of Heroes" accessory, detailing many of the major characters appearing in "Forgotten Realms" novels published up through that time.
In early 1990, the hardcover "Forgotten Realms Adventures" by Jeff Grubb and Ed Greenwood was released, which introduced the Realms setting to the second edition of the "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" game and detailed how the Time of Troubles had changed the setting.
The RPGA used the Forgotten Realms city of Ravens Bluff as the setting for their first living campaign.
Official RPGA support for this product line included the "Living City" modules series.
A number of sub-settings of the Forgotten Realms were briefly supported in the early 1990s.
Three more modules were produced for the Kara-Tur setting.
"The Horde: Barbarian Campaign Setting", released in 1990, detailed The Hordelands, which also featured a series of three modules.
The "Maztica Campaign Set", released in 1991, detailed the continent of Maztica.
The original gray boxed set received a revision in 1993 to update it to the second edition "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D)" rules system, with the release of a new "Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting" boxed set, containing three books ("A Grand Tour of the Realms", "Running the Realms", and "Shadowdale") and various "monster supplements", with a new graphic look.
Additional material for the setting was released steadily throughout the 1990s.
Forgotten Realms novels, such as the "Legacy of the Drow" series, the first three books of "The Elminster Series", and numerous anthologies were also released throughout the 1990s, which led to the setting being hailed as one of the most successful shared fantasy universes of the 1990s.
These novels in turn sparked interest in role-playing activity by new gamers.

========,2,Reception.
In his book "The Fantasy Roleplaying Gamer's Bible", Sean Patrick Fannon describes the Forgotten Realms as being "the most ambitious fantasy game setting published since Tekumel", and that it "may be the most widely played-in game setting in RPG history."
Similarly, in literature, the novels written in the Forgotten Realms setting have formed one of "the industry's leading fantasy series".
Over time these novels have gained "unprecedented popularity", which led, as Marc Oxoby noted in his book, "The 1990s", to the novels having an "extraordinary shelf life", remaining in print for many years.
This popular reception has also been reflected in public libraries.
For example, Joyce Saricks states in "The Readers' Advisory Guide to Genre Fiction" that the novels have been among the most requested books by fans of the fantasy genre.
