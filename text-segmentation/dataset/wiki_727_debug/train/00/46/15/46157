========,1,preface.
Garrett County (gərɛt) is the westernmost county of the U.S. state of Maryland.
As of the 2010 census, the population was 30,097, making it the third-least populous county in Maryland.
Its county seat is Oakland.
The county was named for John Work Garrett (1820–1884), president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.
Created from Allegany County, Maryland in 1872, it was the last Maryland county to be formed.
Garrett County has long been part of the media market of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
It is considered to be a part of Western Maryland.
The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is to the north.
The Maryland–Pennsylvania boundary was surveyed and marked between April 1765 and October 1767 by astronomer Charles Mason and surveyor Jeremiah Dixon.
This boundary is commonly known as the Mason–Dixon line.
The eastern border with Allegany County was defined by the Bauer Report, submitted to Governor Lloyd Lowndes, Jr. on November 9, 1898.
The Potomac River and State of West Virginia lie to the south and west.
Garrett County lies in the Allegheny Mountains, which here form the western flank of the Appalachian Mountain Range.
Hoye-Crest, a summit along Backbone Mountain, is the highest point in Maryland.
The Eastern Continental Divide runs along portions of Backbone Mountain.
The western part of the county, drained by the Youghiogheny River, is the only part of Maryland within the Mississippi River drainage basin.
All other parts of the county are in the Chesapeake Bay basin.
Garrett County contains over of parks, lakes, and publicly accessible forestland.
Popular activities in the county include camping, hiking, backpacking, rock climbing, alpine and cross county skiing, snowmobiling, hunting, ice fishing, fly fishing, whitewater canoeing, kayaking, rafting, boating, swimming, sailing, horseback riding, and water skiing.

========,2,History.
In the early 20th century, the railroad and tourism started to decline.
Coal mining and timber production continued at a much slower pace.
Today, tourism has made a dramatic rebound in the county with logging and farming making up the greatest part of the economic base.
Due to a cool climate and lack of any large city, Garrett County has remained a sparsely populated rural area.
========,2,Geography.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.3%) is water.
It is the second-largest county in Maryland by land area.
Garrett County is Maryland’s westernmost, bordered to the north by the Mason–Dixon line with Pennsylvania, to the south and west by West Virginia (with the Potomac River forming its southern boundary), and to the east by a land border with Allegany County, Maryland.
The county’s northwesternmost point is approximately southeast of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and its southeasternmost point is approximately northwest of Baltimore, Maryland.
Garrett County is located entirely within the highland zone of the Appalachian Mountains known variously as the Allegheny Mountains, the Allegheny Plateau, and the Appalachian Plateau.
The county’s highest elevations are located along four flat-topped ridges and range to a height of at Hoye-Crest along Backbone Mountain, the highest point in the state of Maryland.
As is typical in the Allegheny region, broad flats generally lie below the ridge crests at elevations of approximately .
River valleys are generally narrow and deep, with ravines typically 1,000 to below surrounding peaks.
The county contains over of parks, lakes, and publicly accessible forestland.
It is drained by two river systems, the Potomac and the Youghiogheny.
The Savage River, a tributary of the Potomac, drains about a third of the county.
The Casselman River, a tributary of the Youghiogheny, flows north from the county’s central section into Pennsylvania.
The Youghiogheny itself drains the westernmost area of the county and flows north into Pennsylvania, where it empties into the Monongahela River at McKeesport, just south of Pittsburgh.
========,3,Geologic points of interest.
========,4,The Glades.
The Glades' is of great scientific interest because it is an ombrotrophic system (fed solely by rainwater) with peat layers up to thick, and is one of the oldest examples of mountain peatland in the Appalachians.
On the western edge of the Savage River State Forest along Maryland Route 495 lies Bittinger, Maryland.
Named after Henry Bittinger who first settled in the area, other German settlers moved in and took up the fertile farm land.
On the eastern edge of Bittinger is one of the largest glades area of Garrett County.
Geographically, this is an area which seems to have been affected by the last great ice sheet of North America.
Two miles southeast of Bittinger, there is a large deposit of peat moss.
========,4,Loess Dunes.
In the Casselman River valley, south of Grantsville, Maryland and beside Maryland Route 495, one can see remains of geological evidence about the last great ice sheet over North America.
A series of low mounds can be seen in the fields on the west side of Maryland Route 495 that are "loess" (wind-blown) material.
Apparently, these are the only ones still visible in the northern part of Garrett County.
The mounds were formed when a glacier lake existed in the Casselman valley, and the ice around the edges of the frozen lake melted.
Wind blew fine grains of earth into the water around the edges where it sank to the bottom, and the mounds were the result of the deposit of this wind-blown material.
========,3,Parks and recreation.
========,4,State parks.

========,3,Politics.
Although since the Civil War Maryland has been a Democratic-leaning state, Garrett County, owing to its history of German settlement from north of the Mason–Dixon line, plus strong pre-war Unionism resulting from virtual absence of slaves, has always been rock-ribbed Republican.
Since it was created in 1872, Garrett is one of forty counties across the nation (chiefly Unionist strongholds in antebellum slave states) to have never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate.
Compared with neighbouring and closely allied Grant County, West Virginia, Garrett has not shown quite the same levels of Republican support – Lyndon Johnson did get within 109 votes of Barry Goldwater in 1964 – but as with Grant County, the only occasion Garrett County has not been carried by the official Republican nominee occurred in 1912 when a major split in the Republican Party allowed “Bull Moose Party” nominee and former President Theodore Roosevelt to claim the county.
