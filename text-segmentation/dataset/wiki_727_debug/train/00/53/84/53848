========,1,preface.
San Antonio ( Spanish for "Saint Anthony"), officially the City of San Antonio, is the seventh-most populated city in the United States and the second-most populous city in the state of Texas, with a population of 1,469,845.
It was the fastest growing of the top 10 largest cities in the United States from 2000 to 2010, and the second from 1990 to 2000.
The city straddles South Texas and Central Texas and is on the southwestern corner of an urban megaregion known as the Texas Triangle.
San Antonio serves as the seat of Bexar County.
Recent annexations have extended the city's boundaries into Medina County and, though for only a very tiny area near the city of Garden Ridge, into Comal County.
Due to its placement, the city has characteristics of other western urban centers in which there are sparsely populated areas and a low density rate outside of the city limits.
San Antonio is the center of the San Antonio–New Braunfels Metropolitan Statistical Area.
Commonly referred to as Greater San Antonio, the metropolitan area has a population of 2,454,061 based on the 2017 US Census estimate, making it the 24th-largest metropolitan area in the United States and third-largest in the state of Texas.
Growth along the Interstate 35 and Interstate 10 corridors to the north, west and east make it likely that the metropolitan area will continue to expand.
San Antonio was named for Saint Anthony of Padua, whose feast day is on June 13, by a 1691 Spanish expedition in the area.
The city contains five 18th-century Spanish frontier missions, including The Alamo and San Antonio Missions National Historical Park, which were designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 2015.
Other notable attractions include the River Walk, the Tower of the Americas, SeaWorld, the Alamo Bowl, and Marriage Island.
Commercial entertainment includes Six Flags Fiesta Texas and Morgan's Wonderland amusement parks, and according to the San Antonio Convention and Visitors Bureau, the city is visited by about 32 million tourists a year.
The city is home to the five-time NBA champion San Antonio Spurs and hosts the annual San Antonio Stock Show & Rodeo, one of the largest such events in the country.
The U.S. armed forces have numerous facilities in San Antonio: Fort Sam Houston, Lackland Air Force Base, Randolph Air Force Base (which constitute Joint Base San Antonio), and Lackland AFB/Kelly Field Annex, with Camp Bullis and Camp Stanley located outside the city.
Kelly Air Force Base operated out of San Antonio until 2001, when the airfield was transferred to Lackland AFB.
The remaining portions of the base were developed as Port San Antonio, an industrial/business park and aerospace complex.
San Antonio is home to six Fortune 500 companies and the South Texas Medical Center, the only medical research and care provider in the South Texas region.
========,2,History.
At the time of European encounter, Payaya Indians lived near the San Antonio River Valley in the San Pedro Springs area, calling the vicinity "Yanaguana", meaning "refreshing waters".
In 1691, a group of Spanish Catholic explorers and missionaries came upon the river and Payaya settlement on June 13, the feast day of St. Anthony of Padua.
They named the place and river "San Antonio" in his honor.
It was years before any Spanish settlement took place.
Father Antonio de Olivares visited the site in 1709, and he was determined to found a mission and civilian settlement there.
The viceroy gave formal approval for a combined mission and presidio in late 1716, as he wanted to forestall any French expansion into the area from their colony of "La Louisiane", as well as prevent illegal trading with the Payaya.
He directed Martin de Alarcón, the governor of Coahuila and Texas, to establish the mission complex.
Differences between Alarcón and Olivares resulted in delays, and construction did not start until 1718.
Fray Antonio de Olivares built, with the help of the Payaya Indians, the Misión de San Antonio de Valero (The Alamo), the Presidio San Antonio de Bexar, the bridge that connected both, and the Acequia Madre de Valero.
The families who clustered around the presidio and mission formed the beginnings of Villa de Béjar, destined to become the most important town in Spanish Texas.
On May 1, the governor transferred ownership of the Mission San Antonio de Valero (later famous as the Alamo) to Fray Antonio de Olivares.
On May 5, 1718 he commissioned the Presidio San Antonio de Béxar ("Béjar" in modern Spanish orthography) on the west side of the San Antonio River, one-fourth league from the mission.
On February 14, 1719, the Marquis of San Miguel de Aguayo proposed to the king of Spain that 400 families be transported from the Canary Islands, Galicia, or Havana to populate the province of Texas.
His plan was approved, and notice was given the Canary Islanders ("isleños") to furnish 200 families; the Council of the Indies suggested that 400 families should be sent from the Canaries to Texas by way of Havana and Veracruz.
By June 1730, 25 families had reached Cuba, and 10 families had been sent to Veracruz before orders from Spain came to stop the re-settlement.
Under the leadership of Juan Leal Goraz, the group marched overland from Veracruz to the Presidio San Antonio de Béxar, where they arrived on March 9, 1731.
Due to marriages along the way, the party now included 15 families, a total of 56 persons.
They joined the military community established in 1718.
The immigrants formed the nucleus of the villa of San Fernando de Béxar, the first regularly organized civil government in Texas.
Several older families of San Antonio trace their descent from the Canary Island colonists.
María Rosa Padrón was the first baby born of Canary Islander descent in San Antonio.
During the Spanish Mexican settlement of Southwestern lands, which took place over the following century, Juan Leal Goraz Jr. was a prominent figure.
He claimed nearly 100,000 sq miles (153,766 acres) as Spanish territory and held some control for nearly three decades: this area stretched across six present-day states.
San Antonio was designated as Leal Goraz's capital.
It represented Mexican expansion into the area.
With his robust military forces, he led exploration and establishing Spanish colonial bases as far as San Francisco, California.
Widespread bankruptcy forced Leal Goraz Jr.'s army back into the current boundaries of Mexico; they fell into internal conflict and turmoil with neighboring entities.
San Antonio grew to become the largest Spanish settlement in Texas; it was designated as the capital of the Spanish, later Mexican, province of Tejas.
From San Antonio, the Camino Real (today Nacogdoches Road), was built to the small frontier town of Nacogdoches.
Mexico allowed European-American settlers from the United States into the territory; they mostly occupied land in the eastern part.
When Antonio López de Santa Anna unilaterally abolished the Mexican Constitution of 1824, violence ensued in many states of Mexico.
In a series of battles, the Texian Army succeeded in forcing Mexican soldiers out of the settlement areas east of San Antonio, which were dominated by Americans.
Under the leadership of Ben Milam, in the Battle of Bexar, December 1835, Texian forces captured San Antonio from forces commanded by General Martin Perfecto de Cos, Santa Anna's brother-in-law.
In the spring of 1836, Santa Anna marched on San Antonio.
A volunteer force under the command of James C. Neill occupied and fortified the deserted mission.
Upon his departure, the joint command of William Barrett Travis and James Bowie were left in charge of defending the old mission.
The Battle of the Alamo took place from February 23 to March 6, 1836.
The outnumbered Texian force was ultimately defeated, with all of the Alamo defenders killed.
These men were seen as "martyrs" for the cause of Texas freedom and "Remember the Alamo" became a rallying cry in the Texian Army's eventual success at defeating Santa Anna's army.
Juan Seguín, who organized the company of Tejano patriots, who fought for Texas independence, fought at the Battle of Concepción, Siege of Bexar, and the Battle of San Jacinto, and served as mayor of San Antonio.
He was forced out of that office, due to threats on his life, by sectarian newcomers and political opponents in 1842, becoming the last Tejano mayor for nearly 150 years.
In 1845, the United States finally decided to annex Texas and include it as a state in the Union.
This led to the Mexican–American War.
Though the US ultimately won, the war was devastating to San Antonio.
By its end, the population of the city had been reduced by almost two-thirds, to 800 inhabitants.
Bolstered by migrants and immigrants, by 1860 at the start of the Civil War, San Antonio had grown to a city of 15,000 people.
========,3,Post-Civil War to present.
Following the Civil War, San Antonio prospered as a center of the cattle industry.
During this period, it remained a frontier city, with a mixture of cultures that was different from other US cities.
In the 1850s Frederick Law Olmsted, the landscape architect who designed Central Park in New York City, traveled throughout the South and Southwest, and published accounts of his observations.
In his 1859 book about Texas, Olmsted described San Antonio as having a "jumble of races, costumes, languages, and buildings", which gave it a quality that only New Orleans could rival in what he described as "odd and antiquated foreignness."
In 1877, following the Reconstruction Era, developers constructed the first railroad to San Antonio, connecting it to major markets and port cities.
Texas was the first state to have major cities develop by railroads rather than waterways.
In Texas, the railroads supported a markedly different pattern of development of major interior cities, such as San Antonio, Dallas and Fort Worth, compared to the historical development of coastal port cities in the established eastern states.
At the beginning of the 20th century, the streets of the city's downtown were widened to accommodate street cars and modern traffic.
At that time, many of the older historic buildings were demolished in the process of this modernization.
Since the late twentieth century, San Antonio has had steady population growth.
The city's population has nearly doubled in 35 years, from just over 650,000 in the 1970 census to an estimated 1.2 million in 2005, through both population growth and land annexation (the latter has considerably enlarged the physical area of the city).
In 1990, the United States Census Bureau reported San Antonio's population as 55.6% Hispanic, 7% black, and 36.2% non-Hispanic white.

Crime in San Antonio began to rise in the early 1980s.
In 1983 San Antonio had the 10th highest homicide rate in Texas with 18.5 homicides per 100,000 residents.
The number of juveniles arrested in San Antonio for violent crimes tripled between 1987 and 1994, according to the Texas Law Enforcement Management and Administration Statistics Program.
The number of youths arrested for unlawfully carrying firearms doubled over the same period.
In 1993 San Antonio was nicknamed the "Drive-By City" after San Antonio Police Department recorded over 1,200 drive-by shootings nearly 3.5 per day.
That figure dwarfed the number in other Texas cities, and it unofficially marked San Antonio as the state's drive-by capital.
Although no part of the city was immune, the vast majority of the violence occurred on the East and West Sides, particularly where poverty was prevalent.
Gang members killed each other and innocent bystanders to protect their home turf and drug-selling interests.
Housing projects – such as Alazan-Apache Courts, Cassiano Homes, East Terrace and Wheatley Courts served as hubs for different groups, sometimes housing multiple rival gangs.
By the end of 1993 the city hit a peak in homicides with 230 killings, the highest since 1991 when 211 where killed.
In 2016, the number of murders hit 151, the highest toll in 20 years.
A majority of the San Antonio homicide victims were Hispanic and African-American men between ages 18 and 29.
40% of the killings were either drug-related or domestic incidents.
========,2,Government.
The City of San Antonio runs under a Council-Manager form of government.
The city is divided into 10 council districts designed to ensure equal population distribution between all districts.
Each district elects one person to sit on the City Council with the mayor elected on a citywide basis.
All members of the City Council, which includes the mayor, are elected to two-year terms and are limited to four terms in total (except for those who were in office in November 2008 and are limited to a total of two terms).
Houston and Laredo have similar term limits to those in San Antonio.
All positions are elected on non-partisan ballots as required by Texas law.
Council members are paid $20 per meeting, while the Mayor earns $4,000 a year.
Most council members maintain full-time employment in addition to their positions on the council.
The current mayor is Ron Nirenberg who was elected in 2017.
The council hires a City Manager to handle day-to-day operations.
The council effectively functions as the city's legislative body with the city manager acting as its chief executive, responsible for the management of day-to-day operations and execution of council legislation.
The current city manager is Sheryl Sculley.
The city operates its own electric and gas utility service, CPS Energy.
The San Antonio Police Department (SAPD) is the city's municipal body of law enforcement.
The San Antonio Fire Department (SAFD) provides the city with fire protection and EMS service.

========,3,Growth policy.
Unlike most large cities in the US, San Antonio is not completely surrounded by independent suburban cities, and under Texas state law it exercises extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) over much of the surrounding unincorporated land, including planning major thoroughfares and enforcing rules for platting and subdivision.
It pursues an aggressive annexation policy and opposes the creation of other municipalities within its ETJ.
Nearly three-fourths of its current land area had been annexed since 1960.
In the 2000s the city annexed several long narrow corridors along major thoroughfares in outlying areas to facilitate eventual annexation of growth developing along the routes.
The city planned to annex nearly forty additional square miles by 2009.
In May 2010, the City of San Antonio agreed to release thousands of acres of land in its extraterritorial jurisdiction along Interstate 10 to Schertz.
The agreement releases a total of of San Antonio's ETJ lands north of I-10 to Schertz.
The ETJ lands are in an area bordered by FM 1518 to the west, Lower Seguin Road to the north, Cibolo Creek to the east and I-10 to the south.
Involuntary annexation is a controversial issue in those parts of unincorporated Bexar County affected by it.
Residents attracted to the outlying areas by lower taxes and affordable real estate values, often see annexation as a mechanism to increase property tax rates (which are primarily driven by school district taxes, not city taxes) without a corresponding improvement in services such as police and fire protection, while the city regards its annexation policy as essential to its overall prosperity.
Also, since the City has annexed a large amount of land over time, San Antonio surrounds several independent enclave cities which include Alamo Heights, Terrell Hills, Olmos Park, Hollywood Park, Hill Country Village, Castle Hills, Windcrest, Kirby, Balcones Heights, and Shavano Park.
These neighborhoods are not districts of the City of San Antonio like Lincoln Heights and Brackenridge Park, rather, they are independent cities throughout the San Antonio region completely surrounded, but not directly controlled, by the City of San Antonio.

========,2,Media and entertainment.
========,3,Print.
San Antonio has one major newspaper, the "San Antonio Express-News", which has served the area since 1865.
The "Express-News" currently circulates as the largest newspaper service in South Texas.
The Hearst Corporation, which owned a second newspaper, the "San Antonio Light", purchased the "Express-News" from News Corp. in 1992 and shut down the "Light" after failing to find a buyer.
Hearst, using the Express-News brand, also produces "Conexion", a weekly magazine written by an entirely Hispanic staff with a Hispanic spin on weekly events.

========,3,Radio.
About 50 radio stations can be heard in the San Antonio area—30 of them are actually located in the city proper.
San Antonio is home to iHeartMedia, the largest operator of radio stations in the US.
Its flagship, WOAI AM-1200, is known for its local news operation, considered among the best in the country.
It is a 50,000-watt clear channel station that reaches most of North America at night.
The first radio station to broadcast in south Texas was KTSA AM-550 in 1922.
The region's National Public Radio member is Texas Public Radio, a group of three stations; KSTX 89.1 FM is NPR news/talk, KPAC 88.3 is a 24-hour classical music station, and KTXI 90.1 is a mix of NPR news/talk and classical music broadcast for the West Central Texas Hill Country.
KSTX also broadcasts "Riverwalk Jazz", featuring Jim Cullum Jazz Band at The Landing, a fixture on the River Walk since 1963.
KRTU 91.7 is a non-commercial radio station based out of Trinity University.
Unlike other college radio stations throughout the US, the station plays jazz 17 hours a day and college rock/indie rock at night.
College Alternative station KSYM, 90.1 FM, is owned by the Alamo Community College District and operated by San Antonio College students and like KRTU it plays the Third Coast music network during the day and alternative music at night.
Most Latin stations in the area play regional Mexican, Tejano or contemporary pop.
On January 12, 2006, Univision-owned KCOR-FM "La Kalle 95.1" changed its format from Hispanic-Rhythmic Contemporary Hits to Spanish Oldies, then named "Recuerdo 95.1".
However, Univision announced on November 10, 2006, that it flipped KLTO Tejano 97.7's format to reggaeton in an attempt to reintroduce the format to San Antonio.
Then, 97.7 was flipped again to feature a rock format.
The station no longer broadcasts anything in English and while still owned by Univision, it had broadcast music from artists such as Linkin Park, before selling the station to the Educational Media Foundation and flipping it once again to Air1.
95.1 was then flipped back to the "La Kalle" format again after being flipped to feature a "95X" format.
KLTO was acquired and is operated as a simulcast of KXTN-FM Tejano 107.5.
San Antonio radio is diversified, due to an influx of non-Tejano Latinos, mostly from the East Coast, who are serving in the city's various military bases, as well as immigrants from Mexico.
Therefore, just like in the rest of the country, radio station conglomerates have been changing formats in San Antonio to reflect shifting demographics.
========,3,Television.
Despite the relatively large size of both the city proper and the metropolitan area, San Antonio has always been a medium-sized market.
It presently ranks 33rd in the United States, according to marketing research firm ACNielsen.
By comparison, the other two Texas cities with populations of over a million people, Houston and Dallas, are among the 10 largest markets.
This is mainly because the nearby suburban and rural areas are not much larger than the city itself.
