========,2,Form and content.
Senryū is named after Edo period haikai poet Senryū Karai (柄井川柳, 1718-1790), whose collection launched the genre into the public consciousness.
A typical example from the collection:
This senryū, which can also be translated "Catching him / you see the robber / is your son," is not so much a personal experience of the author as an example of a type of situation (provided by a short comment called a maeku or fore-verse, which usually prefaces a number of examples) and/or a brief or witty rendition of an incident from history or the arts (plays, songs, tales, poetry, etc.).
In this case, there was a historical incident of legendary proportion.
Some senryū skirt the line between haiku and senryū.
The following senryū by Shūji Terayama copies the haiku structure faithfully, down to a blatantly obvious kigo, but on closer inspection is absurd in its content:
Terayama, who wrote about playing hide-and-seek in the graveyard as a child, thought of himself as the odd one out, the one who was always "it" in hide-and-seek.
Indeed, the original haiku included the theme "oni" (the "it" in Japanese is a demon, though in some parts a very young child forced to play "it" was called a "sea slug" (namako)).
To him, seeing a game of hide-and-seek, or recalling it as it grew cold would be a chilling experience.
Terayama might also have recalled opening his eyes and finding himself all alone, feeling the cold more intensely than he did a minute before among other children.
Either way, any genuinely personal experience would be haiku and not senryū in the classic sense.
If you think Terayama's poem uses a child's game to express in hyperbolic metaphor how, in retrospect, life is short, and nothing more, then this would indeed work as a senryū.
Otherwise, it is a bona-fide haiku.
There is also the possibility that it is a joke about playing hide and seek, only to realize (winter having arrived during the months spent hiding) that no one wants to find you.
========,2,English-language senryū publications.
In the 1970s, Michael McClintock edited "Seer Ox: American Senryu Magazine".
In 1993, Michael Dylan Welch edited and published "Fig Newtons: Senryū to Go", the first anthology of English-language senryū.

Additionally, one can regularly find senryū and related articles in some haiku publications.

Senryū regularly appear in the pages of "Modern Haiku", "Frogpond", "Tundra", and other haiku journals, often unsegregated from haiku.
========,2,Senryū awards.
The Haiku Society of America holds the annual Gerald Brady Memorial Award for best unpublished senryū.
Since about 1990, the Haiku Poets of Northern California has been running a senryū contest, as part of its San Francisco International Haiku and Senryu Contest.
