========,1,preface.
This article is about the demographic features of the population of Suriname, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.
Most Surinamese people live in the narrow, northern coastal plain.
The population is one of the most ethnically varied in the world.
Each ethnic group preserves its own culture and many institutions, including political parties, tend to follow ethnic lines.
Informal relationships vary: the upper classes of all ethnic backgrounds mix freely; outside of the elite, social relations tend to remain within ethnic groupings.
All groups may be found in the schools and workplace.
