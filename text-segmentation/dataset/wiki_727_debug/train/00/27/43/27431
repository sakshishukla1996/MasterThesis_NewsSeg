========,1,preface.
Some human rights organizations have documented a variety of abuses and atrocities carried out by the Sudanese government over the past several years.
The 2009 Human Rights Report by the United States Department of State noted serious concerns over human rights violations by the government and militia groups.
Capital punishment, including crucifixion, is used for many crimes.
========,2,Abuses in conflict settings.
Conflicts between the government and rebel groups — the civil war involving north-south tensions, the Darfur conflict involving Arab-tribespeople tensions in the Darfur region in the west — have resulted in rape, torture, killings, and massive population displacements (estimated at over 2 million in 2007), earning Sudan comparison to Rwanda in the press.
There have also been several reported cases of crucifixions carried out in Sudan.
According to the "Christian Science Monitor" on 25 March 2004:
The Darfur region war boils down to this: African tribes have long been at odds with Arab groups in the region over access to good land.
Then, last year, two armed African groups began a rebellion against the Khartoum regime.
The government responded by apparently giving military support to Arab militias.
There are reports of Sudanese military planes bombing villages, after which Arab militias go in and rape and kill survivors.
========,2,Ethnic cleansing in Darfur.
The conflict has been described by Mukesh Kapila, United Nations (UN) coordinator for Sudan, as ethnic cleansing, as Black Arab militias carry out systematic massacres of tribespeople in the Darfur region.
According to Kapila, "The government has a close knowledge of what's going on - and can influence the Arab militia."
The UN has estimated that 300,000 civilians in the Darfur region were killed between 2003 and 2010.
========,2,Slavery.
Some organizations, in particular Christian Solidarity Worldwide and related organizations, argue that enslavement exists in Sudan and is encouraged by the Sudanese government.
As an example of such allegations, in "The Wall Street Journal" on 12 December 2001, Michael Rubin said:
...[O]n 4 October, Sudanese Vice President Ali Uthman Taha declared, "The jihad is our way and we will not abandon it and will keep its banner high.
Between 23–26 October, Sudanese government troops attacked villages near the southern town of Aweil, killing 93 men and enslaving 85 women and children.
Then, on 2 November, the Sudanese military attacked villages near the town of Nyamlell, carrying off another 113 women and children.
A Kenyan aide worker was also abducted, and has not been seen since.
What's Sudanese slavery like?
One 11-year-old Christian boy told me about his first days in captivity: "I was told to be a Muslim several times, and I refused, which is why they cut off my finger."
Twelve-year-old Alokor Ngor Deng was taken as a slave in 1993.
She has not seen her mother since the slave raiders sold the two to different masters.
Thirteen-year-old Akon was seized by Sudanese military while in her village five years ago.
She was gang-raped by six government soldiers, and witnessed seven executions before being sold to a Sudanese Arab.
Many freed slaves bore signs of beatings, burnings and other tortures.
More than three-quarters of formerly enslaved women and girls reported rapes.
While nongovernmental organizations argue over how to end slavery, few deny the existence of the practice.
...[E]stimates of the number of blacks now enslaved in Sudan vary from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands (not counting those sold as forced labor in Libya)... On the other hand, fraud in the name of "slave redemption" has been documented before.
========,2,Women's rights.
Sudan is a developing nation that faces many challenges in regard to gender inequality.
Freedom House gave Sudan the lowest possible ranking among repressive regimes during 2012.
South Sudan received a slightly higher rating but it was also rated as "not free".
In the 2013 report of 2012 data, Sudan ranks 171st out of 186 countries on the Human Development Index (HDI).
Sudan also is one of very few countries that are not a signatory on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW).
Despite all of this, there have been positive changes in regard to gender equality in Sudan.
As of 2012, women embodied 24.1% of the National Assembly of Sudan.
Sudanese women account for a larger percentage of the national parliament than many Westernized nations.
Notwithstanding that, gender inequalities in Sudan, particularly as they pertain to female genital mutilation and the disparity of women to men in the labor market, have received attention in the international community.

========,2,Child soldiers.
According to Rory Mungoven, spokesman for the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers, Sudan has one of the worst child soldier problems in the world.
There are more than 17,000 child soldiers fighting for the governments' side or for rebel forces even after 25,000 former child soldiers had been demobilized from rebel groups in Southern Sudan in 2001.
They carry AK-47s and M-16s on the front lines of combat, while serving as human mine detectors, participating in suicide missions, and acting as spies.
Many are abducted or recruited by force, and often compelled to follow orders under the threat of death.
Others join armed groups out of desperation or after being subjected to lies and brainwash.
Many children are promised that they are going to attend school, which are actually military training facilities disguised as school.
The facilities, despite being under the direction of the United Nations and international organizations, are where children were brainwashed to become ruthless killers.
Improvements in technology have provided weapons which weigh less, cost less, and can be assembled, loaded, and fired by an illiterate child, adding additional appeal to child soldiers.
========,2,Prisoner abuse.
Several hundred adults and children were imprisoned after members of the Justice and Equality Movement attacked Khartoum in May 2008, a disproportionate number from the Darfur region.
Human Rights Watch criticised the Sudanese government for refusing to provide any information on their whereabouts.
Evidence of widespread torture and abuse was found on released prisoners and was gathered in numerous interviews recorded by Human Rights Watch.
========,2,Persecution of human rights defenders.
In the period from 2003 to 2011, Mudawi Ibrahim Adam was repeatedly arrested for charges related to his human rights work with the group Sudan Social Development Organization.
These arrests were protested by groups including Human Rights Watch, Front Line, and Amnesty International, the latter of whom named him a "prisoner of conscience."
On 5 March 2009, the same day that President Omar al-Bashir was indicted by the ICC, the Sudanese government ordered the closure of SUDO, and its offices were taken over by state security forces.
The "New York Times" reported that the letter closing the offices "came from the Humanitarian Affairs Commission, which is run by Ahmed Haroun, one of the people facing an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for mass slaughter in Darfur."
The Sudanese government simultaneously expelled "the International Rescue Committee, Oxfam UK, CARE, Mercy Corps and the Dutch section of Doctors Without Borders.
Mudawi and SUDO appealed their closure in court, winning the appeal in April 2010.
However, according to a 2011 SUDO press release, the organization remains effectively closed: "in Sudan you can win a case but nothing changes.
SUDO’s offices remained locked, its assets remained frozen, and the organization in Sudan was not allowed to resume operations."
========,2,Religious Persecution.
Pastors Michael Yat and Peter Yan have been held incommunicado by Sudan's National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) from 14 December 2014 and 11 January 2015 respectively, on 1 March they were charged with eight offences under the 1991 Penal Code, two of which carry the death sentence.
Peter Yan was reported to be arrested whilst enquiring into Michael Yat's welfare, and Michael Yat was arrested following evangelistic preaching.
========,2,Historical situation.
The following chart shows Sudan's ratings since 1972 in the Freedom in the World reports, published annually by Freedom House.
A rating of 1 is "free"; 7, "not free".
========,2,LGBT rights.
Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons in Sudan face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents.
Both male and female same-sex sexual activity is illegal in Sudan, with sentences including but not limited to capital punishment.
