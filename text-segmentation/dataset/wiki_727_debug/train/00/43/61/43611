========,1,preface.
Hari (Devanagari: हरि), the one who forgives all sins, is a primary god in Hinduism and an avatar of Vishnu.
The terms "Hari" and "Vishnu" are often used interchangeably.
Hari is usually depicted as a pale-blue being, similar to Vishnu's incarnations of Rama and Krishna.
He holds a padma (lotus flower) in his lower left hand, the Kaumodaki gada (mace) in his lower right hand, the Panchajanya shankha (conch) in his upper left hand and the discus weapon considered to be the most powerful weapon according to Hindu Religion Sudarshana Chakra in his upper right hand and also have a bow named as sharanga and due to which he is sometimes named as sharangapani (hari) in Bhagvad Gita.
Om precedes all else as in Om Namah Shivaya, Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya, Om Namo Narayanaya.
But only Hari precedes Om in the form of Harih om or Harih om tat sat.
It is believed that Hari is astrologer who discovered the distance between earth and sun.
The distance of Earth from the Sun is about 108 times the diameter of the Sun (actually closer to 107.51, as per definition of the AU).
Actual ratio varies between 105.7 (Perihelion) and 109.3 (Aphelion).
Vaishnavite Tradition has 108 Divya Kshetras of Lord Vishnu, called as 108 Divya Desams.
The word "Hari" is widely used in later Sanskrit and Prakrit literature, Hindu, Buddhist, Jain and Sikh religions.
It appears as 650th name of Vishnu in the Vishnu sahasranama of the Mahabharata and hence rose to special importance in Hindu Vaishnavism.
