========,1,preface.
In computing, the Java API for XML Processing, or JAXP ( ), one of the Java XML Application programming interfaces (API)s, provides the capability of validating and parsing XML documents.
It has three basic parsing interfaces:
***LIST***.
In addition to the parsing interfaces, the API provides an XSLT interface to provide data and structural transformations on an XML document.
JAXP was developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 5 (JAXP 1.0), JSR 63 (JAXP 1.1 and 1.2), and JSR 206 (JAXP 1.3).
JAXP version 1.4.4 was released on September 3, 2010.
JAXP 1.3 was end-of-lifed on February 12, 2008.
========,2,StAX interface.
StAX was designed as a median between the DOM and SAX interface.
In its metaphor, the programmatic entry point is a cursor that represents a point within the document.
The application moves the cursor forward - 'pulling' the information from the parser as it needs.
This is different from an event based API - such as SAX - which 'pushes' data to the application - requiring the application to maintain state between events as necessary to keep track of location within the document.
========,2,XSLT interface.
========,3,Example.
The most primitive but complete example of XSLT transformation launching may look like this:
It applies the following hardcoded XSLT transformation:
To the following hardcoded XML document:
The result of execution will be
