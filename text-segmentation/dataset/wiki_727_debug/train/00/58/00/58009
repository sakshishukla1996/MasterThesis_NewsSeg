========,1,preface.
Good Friday is a Christian holiday commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and his death at Calvary.
It is observed during Holy Week as part of the Paschal Triduum on the Friday preceding Easter Sunday, and may coincide with the Jewish observance of Passover.
It is also known as Holy Friday, Great Friday, Black Friday, or Easter Friday, though the last term properly refers to the Friday in Easter week.
The date of the holiday on the Gregorian calendar varies from one year to the next, and there is disagreement about its calculation.
It is a widely instituted legal holiday around the world, including in most Western countries and 12 U.S. states.
Some countries, such as Germany, have laws prohibiting certain acts, such as dancing and horse racing, that are seen as profaning the solemn nature of the day.
========,2,Name.
========,3,Etymology.
The etymology of the term "good" in the context of Good Friday is contested.
Some sources claim "good" to simply mean "pious" or "holy", while others contend that it is a corruption of "God Friday".
The "Oxford English Dictionary" supports the first etymology, giving "of a day or season observed as holy by the church" as an archaic sense of "good" ("good", adj.
8c), and providing examples of "good tide" meaning "Christmas" or "Shrove Tuesday", and "Good Wednesday" meaning the Wednesday in Holy Week.
========,3,Other languages.
In German-speaking countries, Good Friday is generally referred to as "Karfreitag" ("Kar" from Old High German "kara"‚ "bewail", "grieve"‚ "mourn", Freitag for "Friday"): Mourning Friday.
The "Kar" prefix is a cognate of the English word "care" in the sense of cares and woes; it meant mourning.
The day is also known as "Stiller Freitag" ("Silent Friday") and "Hoher Freitag" ("High Friday, Holy Friday").
In the Nordic countries it is called "The Long Friday".
========,2,Biblical accounts.
According to the accounts in the Gospels, the royal soldiers, guided by Jesus' disciple Judas Iscariot, arrested Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane.
Judas received money (30 pieces of silver) () for betraying Jesus and told the guards that whomever he kisses is the one they are to arrest.
Following his arrest, Jesus was taken to the house of Annas, the father-in-law of the high priest, Caiaphas.
There he was interrogated with little result and sent bound to Caiaphas the high priest where the Sanhedrin had assembled ().
Conflicting testimony against Jesus was brought forth by many witnesses, to which Jesus answered nothing.
Finally the high priest adjured Jesus to respond under solemn oath, saying "I adjure you, by the Living God, to tell us, are you the Anointed One, the Son of God?"
Jesus testified ambiguously, "You have said it, and in time you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Almighty, coming on the clouds of Heaven."
The high priest condemned Jesus for blasphemy, and the Sanhedrin concurred with a sentence of death ().
Peter, waiting in the courtyard, also denied Jesus three times to bystanders while the interrogations were proceeding just as Jesus had predicted.
In the morning, the whole assembly brought Jesus to the Roman governor Pontius Pilate under charges of subverting the nation, opposing taxes to Caesar, and making himself a king ().
Pilate authorized the Jewish leaders to judge Jesus according to their own law and execute sentencing; however, the Jewish leaders replied that they were not allowed by the Romans to carry out a sentence of death ().
Pilate questioned Jesus and told the assembly that there was no basis for sentencing.
Upon learning that Jesus was from Galilee, Pilate referred the case to the ruler of Galilee, King Herod, who was in Jerusalem for the Passover Feast.
Herod questioned Jesus but received no answer; Herod sent Jesus back to Pilate.
Pilate told the assembly that neither he nor Herod found Jesus to be guilty; Pilate resolved to have Jesus whipped and released ().
Under the guidance of the chief priests, the crowd asked for Barabbas, who had been imprisoned for committing murder during an insurrection.
Pilate asked what they would have him do with Jesus, and they demanded, "Crucify him" ().
Pilate's wife had seen Jesus in a dream earlier that day, and she forewarned Pilate to "have nothing to do with this righteous man" ().
Pilate had Jesus flogged and then brought him out to the crowd to release him.
The chief priests informed Pilate of a new charge, demanding Jesus be sentenced to death "because he claimed to be God's son."
This possibility filled Pilate with fear, and he brought Jesus back inside the palace and demanded to know from where he came ().
Coming before the crowd one last time, Pilate declared Jesus innocent and washed his own hands in water to show he had no part in this condemnation.
Nevertheless, Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified in order to forestall a riot () and ultimately to keep his job.
The sentence written was "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews."
Jesus carried his cross to the site of execution (assisted by Simon of Cyrene), called the "place of the Skull", or "Golgotha" in Hebrew and in Latin "Calvary".
There he was crucified along with two criminals ().
Jesus agonized on the cross for six hours.
During his last three hours on the cross, from noon to 3 pm, darkness fell over the whole land.
Jesus spoke from the cross, quoting the messianic Psalm 22: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
With a loud cry, Jesus gave up his spirit.
There was an earthquake, tombs broke open, and the curtain in the Temple was torn from top to bottom.
This tear, according to Christian tradition, signified a removal of restriction of the common Jews from the Temple's "Holiest of Holies", and that God's people now could, themselves, communicate directly with their advocate before God, Jesus the Christ, rather than needing the Temple's High Priest as an intercessor.
The centurion on guard at the site of crucifixion declared, "Truly this was God's Son!"
() Joseph of Arimathea, a member of the Sanhedrin and secret follower of Jesus, who had not consented to his condemnation, went to Pilate to request the body of Jesus ().
Another secret follower of Jesus and member of the Sanhedrin named Nicodemus brought about a hundred-pound weight mixture of spices and helped wrap the body of Jesus ().
Pilate asked confirmation from the centurion of whether Jesus was dead ().
A soldier pierced the side of Jesus with a lance causing blood and water to flow out (), and the centurion informed Pilate that Jesus was dead ().
Joseph of Arimathea took Jesus' body, wrapped it in a clean linen shroud, and placed it in his own new tomb that had been carved in the rock () in a garden near the site of crucifixion.
Nicodemus () also brought 75 pounds of myrrh and aloes, and placed them in the linen with the body, in keeping with Jewish burial customs ().
They rolled a large rock over the entrance of the tomb ().
Then they returned home and rested, because Shabbat had begun at sunset ().
28:1 "After the Shabbat, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb".
i.e.
"After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week...".
"He is not here; he has risen, just as he said...".(Matt.
28:6) On the third day, which is now known as Easter Sunday (or Pascha), Jesus rose from the dead.
========,2,In Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Christianity.
Byzantine Christians (Eastern Christians who follow the Rite of Constantinople: Orthodox Christians and Greek-Catholics) call this day "Great and Holy Friday", or simply "Great Friday".
Because the sacrifice of Jesus through his crucifixion is commemorated on this day, the Divine Liturgy (the sacrifice of bread and wine) is never celebrated on Great Friday, except when this day coincides with the Great Feast of the Annunciation, which falls on the fixed date of 25 March (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian Calendar, 25 March currently falls on 7 April of the modern Gregorian Calendar).
Also on Great Friday, the clergy no longer wear the purple or red that is customary throughout Great Lent, but instead don black vestments.
There is no "stripping of the altar" on Holy and Great Thursday as in the West; instead, all of the church hangings are changed to black, and will remain so until the Divine Liturgy on Great Saturday.
The faithful revisit the events of the day through public reading of specific Psalms and the Gospels, and singing hymns about Christ's death.
Rich visual imagery and symbolism as well as stirring hymnody are remarkable elements of these observances.
In the Orthodox understanding, the events of Holy Week are not simply an annual commemoration of past events, but the faithful actually participate in the death and resurrection of Jesus.
Each hour of this day is the new suffering and the new effort of the expiatory suffering of the Savior.
And the echo of this suffering is already heard in every word of our worship service – unique and incomparable both in the power of tenderness and feeling and in the depth of the boundless compassion for the suffering of the Savior.
The Holy Church opens before the eyes of believers a full picture of the redeeming suffering of the Lord beginning with the bloody sweat in the Garden of Gethsemane up to the crucifixion on Golgotha.
Taking us back through the past centuries in thought, the Holy Church brings us to the foot of the cross of Christ erected on Golgotha, and makes us present among the quivering spectators of all the torture of the Savior.
Great and Holy Friday is observed as a strict fast, and adult Byzantine Christians are expected to abstain from all food and drink the entire day to the extent that their health permits.
"On this Holy day neither a meal is offered nor do we eat on this day of the crucifixion.
If someone is unable or has become very old [or is] unable to fast, he may be given bread and water after sunset.
In this way we come to the holy commandment of the Holy Apostles not to eat on Great Friday."
========,3,Matins of Holy and Great Friday.
The Byzantine Christian observance of Holy and Great Friday, which is formally known as The Order of Holy and Saving Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, begins on Thursday night with the Matins of the Twelve Passion Gospels.
Scattered throughout this Matins service are twelve readings from all four of the Gospels which recount the events of the Passion from the Last Supper through the Crucifixion and burial of Jesus.
Some churches have a candelabrum with twelve candles on it, and after each Gospel reading one of the candles is extinguished.
The first of these twelve readings is the longest Gospel reading of the liturgical year, and is a concatenation from all four Gospels.
Just before the sixth Gospel reading, which recounts Jesus being nailed to the cross, a large cross is carried out of the sanctuary by the priest, accompanied by incense and candles, and is placed in the center of the nave (where the congregation gathers)"Sēmeron Kremātai Epí Xýlou":
Today He who hung the earth upon the waters is hung upon the Cross "(three times)".<br>He who is King of the angels is arrayed in a crown of thorns.<br>He who wraps the Heavens in clouds is wrapped in the purple of mockery.
<br>He who in Jordan set Adam free receives blows upon His face.<br>The Bridegroom of the Church is transfixed with nails.
<br>The Son of the Virgin is pierced with a spear.<br>We venerate Thy Passion, O Christ "(three times)".<br>Show us also Thy glorious Resurrection.
The readings are:
***LIST***.
During the service, all come forward to kiss the feet of Christ on the cross.
After the Canon, a brief, moving hymn, "The Wise Thief" is chanted by singers who stand at the foot of the cross in the center of the nave.
The service does not end with the First Hour, as usual, but with a special dismissal by the priest:
May Christ our true God, Who for the salvation of the world endured spitting, and scourging, and buffeting, and the Cross, and death, through the intercessions of His most pure Mother, of our holy and God-bearing fathers, and of all the saints, have mercy on us and save us, for He is good and the Lover of mankind.
========,3,Royal Hours.
The next day, in the forenoon on Friday, all gather again to pray the Royal Hours, a special expanded celebration of the Little Hours (including the First Hour, Third Hour, Sixth Hour, Ninth Hour and Typica) with the addition of scripture readings (Old Testament, Epistle and Gospel) and hymns about the Crucifixion at each of the Hours (some of the material from the previous night is repeated).
This is somewhat more festive in character, and derives its name of "Royal" from both the fact that the Hours are served with more solemnity than normal, commemorating Christ the King who humbled himself for the salvation of mankind, and also from the fact that this service was in the past attended by the Emperor and his court.
========,3,Vespers of Holy and Great Friday.
In the afternoon, around 3 pm, all gather for the Vespers of the Taking-Down from the Cross, commemorating the Deposition from the Cross.
The Gospel reading is a concatenation taken from all four of the Gospels.
During the service, the body of Christ (the "soma") is removed from the cross, as the words in the Gospel reading mention Joseph of Arimathea, wrapped in a linen shroud, and taken to the altar in the sanctuary.
Near the end of the service an "epitaphios" or "winding sheet" (a cloth embroidered with the image of Christ prepared for burial) is carried in procession to a low table in the nave which represents the Tomb of Christ; it is often decorated with an abundance of flowers.
The epitaphios itself represents the body of Jesus wrapped in a burial shroud, and is a roughly full-size cloth icon of the body of Christ.
Then the priest may deliver a homily and everyone comes forward to venerate the epitaphios.
In the Slavic practice, at the end of Vespers, Compline is immediately served, featuring a special "Canon of the Crucifixion of our Lord and the Lamentation of the Most Holy Theotokos" by Symeon the Logothete.
========,3,Matins of Holy and Great Saturday.
On Friday night, the Matins of Holy and Great Saturday, a unique service known as The Lamentation at the Tomb ("Epitáphios Thrēnos") is celebrated.
This service is also sometimes called "Jerusalem Matins".
Much of the service takes place around the tomb of Christ in the center of the nave.
A unique feature of the service is the chanting of the Lamentations or Praises ("Enkōmia"), which consist of verses chanted by the clergy interspersed between the verses of Psalm 119 (which is, by far, the longest psalm in the Bible).
The "Enkōmia" are the best-loved hymns of Byzantine hymnography, both their poetry and their music being uniquely suited to each other and to the spirit of the day.
They consist of 185 tercet antiphons arranged in three parts ("stáseis" or "stops"), which are interjected with the verses of Psalm 119, and nine short "doxastiká" ("Gloriae") and "Theotókia" (invocations to the Virgin Mary).
The three "stáseis" are each set to its own music, and are commonly known by their initial antiphons: , "Life in a grave", , "Worthy it is", and , "All the generations".
Musically they can be classified as strophic, with 75, 62, and 48 tercet stanzas each, respectively.
The climax of the "Enkōmia" comes during the third "stásis", with the antiphon "Ō glyký mou Éar", a lamentation of the Virgin for her dead Child ("O, my sweet spring, my sweetest child, where has your beauty gone?").
The author(s) and date of the "Enkōmia" are unknown.
Their High Attic linguistic style suggests a dating around the 6th century, possibly before the time of St. Romanos the Melodist.
At the end of the Great Doxology, while the Trisagion is sung, the epitaphios is taken in procession around the outside the church, and is then returned to the tomb.
Some churches observe the practice of holding the epitaphios at the door, above waist level, so the faithful most bow down under it as they come back into the church, symbolizing their entering into the death and resurrection of Christ.
The epitaphios will lay in the tomb until the Paschal Service early Sunday morning.
In some churches, the epitaphios is never left alone, but is accompanied 24 hours a day by a reader chanting from the Psalter.
The Troparion (hymn of the day) of Good Friday is:
<poem> The noble Joseph, when he had taken down Thy most pure Body from the tree, wrapped it in fine linen, and anointed it with spices, and placed it in a new tomb.
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, both now and ever, and unto ages of ages.
The angel came to the myrrh-bearing women at the tomb and said:
Myrrh is fitting for the dead, but Christ has shown Himself a stranger to corruption.
========,2,In the Roman Catholic Church.
========,3,Day of Fasting.
The Catholic Church regards Good Friday and Holy Saturday as the Paschal fast, in accord with Article 110 of Sacrosanctum Concilium.
In the Latin Church, a fast day is understood as having only one full meal and two collations (a smaller repast, the two of which together do not equal the one full meal) – although this may be observed less stringently on Holy Saturday than on Good Friday – and on which the faithful abstain from eating meat.
This is why many places have the typical 'Fish Friday'.
In countries where Good Friday is not a day of rest from work, the afternoon liturgical service is usually put off until a few hours after the recommended time of 3 pm.
========,3,Services on the day.
The Roman Rite has no celebration of Mass between the Lord's Supper on Holy Thursday evening and the Easter Vigil unless a special exemption is granted for rare solemn or grave occasions by the Vatican or the local bishop.
The only sacraments celebrated during this time are Baptism (for those in danger of death), Penance, and Anointing of the Sick.
While there is no celebration of the Eucharist, it is distributed to the faithful only in the Service of the Passion of the Lord, but can also be taken at any hour to the sick who are unable to attend this service.
During this period crosses, candlesticks, and altar cloths are removed from the altar which remains completely bare, though these things are gradually added to the altar as part of the ceremony.
It is also customary to empty the holy water fonts in preparation of the blessing of the water at the Easter Vigil.
Traditionally, no bells are rung on Good Friday or Holy Saturday until the Easter Vigil.
The Celebration of the Passion of the Lord takes place in the afternoon, ideally at three o'clock, but for pastoral reasons a later hour may be chosen.
The vestments used are red (more commonly) or black (more traditionally).
Before 1970, vestments were black except for the Communion part of the rite when violet was used.
Before 1955 black was used throughout.
If a bishop or abbot celebrates, he wears a plain mitre ("mitra simplex").
========,3,Stations of the Cross.
In addition to the prescribed liturgical service, the Stations of the Cross are often prayed either in the church or outside, and a prayer service may be held from midday to 3.00 pm, known as the Three Hours' Agony.
In countries such as Malta, Italy, Philippines, Puerto Rico and Spain, processions with statues representing the Passion of Christ are held.
In Rome, since the papacy of Saint John Paul II, the heights of the Temple of Venus and Roma and their position opposite the main entrance to the Colosseum have been used to good effect as a public address platform.
This may be seen in the photograph below where a red canopy has been erected to shelter the Pope as well as an illuminated cross, on the occasion of the Way of the Cross ceremony.
The Pope, either personally or through a representative, leads the faithful through meditations on the stations of the cross while a cross is carried from there to the Colosseum.
In Polish churches, a tableau of Christ's Tomb is unveiled in the sanctuary.
Many of the faithful spend long hours into the night grieving at the Tomb, where it is customary to kiss the wounds on the Lord's body.
A life-size figure of Jesus lying in his tomb is widely visited by the faithful, especially on Holy Saturday.
The tableaux may include flowers, candles, figures of angels standing watch, and the three crosses atop Mt Calvary, and much more.
Each parish strives to come up with the most artistically and religiously evocative arrangement in which the Blessed Sacrament, draped in a filmy veil, is prominently displayed.
========,3,Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ.
The Roman Catholic tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as "acts of reparation" for the sufferings and insults that Jesus suffered during his Passion on Good Friday.
These "Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ" do not involve a petition for a living or deceased beneficiary, but aim to "repair the sins" against Jesus.
Some such prayers are provided in the Raccolta Catholic prayer book (approved by a Decree of 1854, and published by the Holy See in 1898) which also includes prayers as Acts of Reparation to the Virgin Mary.
In his encyclical "Miserentissimus Redemptor" on reparations, Pope Pius XI called Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ a duty for Catholics and referred to them as ""some sort of compensation to be rendered for the injury" with respect to the sufferings of Jesus.
Pope John Paul II referred to Acts of Reparation as the "unceasing effort to stand beside the endless crosses on which the Son of God continues to be crucified"".
========,2,Anglican Communion.
The 1662 Book of Common Prayer did not specify a particular rite to be observed on Good Friday but local custom came to mandate an assortment of services, including the Seven Last Words from the Cross and a three-hour service consisting of Matins, Ante-communion (using the Reserved Sacrament in high church parishes) and Evensong.
In recent times, revised editions of the Prayer Book and Common Worship have re-introduced pre-Reformation forms of observance of Good Friday corresponding to those in today's Roman Catholic Church, with special nods to the rites that had been observed in the Church of England prior to the Henrican, Edwardian and Elizabethan reforms, including Creeping to the Cross.
========,2,Lutheran Church.
In Lutheran tradition from the 16th to the 20th century, Good Friday was the most important religious holiday, and abstention from all worldly works was expected.
During that time, Lutheranism had no restrictions on the celebration of the Eucharist on Good Friday; on the contrary, it was a prime day on which to receive the Eucharist, and services were often accentuated by special music such as the "St Matthew Passion" by Johann Sebastian Bach.
More recently, Lutheran liturgical practice has recaptured Good Friday as part of the larger sweep of the great Three Days: Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and the Vigil of Easter.
The Three Days remain one liturgy which celebrates the death and resurrection of Jesus.
As part of the liturgy of the Three Days, Lutherans generally fast from the Eucharist on Good Friday.
Rather, it is celebrated in remembrance of the Last Supper on Maundy Thursday and at the Vigil of Easter.
One practice among Lutheran churches is to celebrate a tenebrae service on Good Friday, typically conducted in candlelight and consisting of a collection of passion accounts from the four gospels.
While being called "Tenebrae" it holds little resemblance to the now-suppressed Catholic monastic rite of the same name.
The Good Friday liturgy appointed in "Evangelical Lutheran Worship", the worship book of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, specifies a liturgy similar to the revised Roman Catholic liturgy.
A rite for adoration of the crucified Christ includes the optional singing of the Solemn Reproaches in an updated and revised translation which eliminates some of the anti-Jewish overtones in previous versions.
Influenced by the ecumenical liturgical renewal movement and in an attempt to recover patterns of worship from the early church, many Lutheran congregations are moving away from long preaching services centered on a dramatic and sentimentalized remembrance of the "Seven Last Words," sayings of Jesus assembled from the four gospels, toward a more devotional practice that places an emphasis on the triumph of the cross, and a singular biblical account of the Passion narrative from the Gospel of John.
========,2,Other Protestant traditions.
Many other Protestant communities hold special services on this day as well.
Moravians hold a Lovefeast on Good Friday as they receive Holy Communion on Maundy Thursday.
The Methodist Church commemorates Good Friday with a service of worship, often based on the Seven Last Words from the Cross.
It is not uncommon for some communities to hold interdenominational services on Good Friday.
Some Baptist, Pentecostal, many Sabbatarian and non-denominational churches oppose the observance of Good Friday, regarding it as a papist tradition, and instead observe the Crucifixion on Wednesday to coincide with the Jewish sacrifice of the Passover Lamb (which Christians believe is an Old Testament pointer to Jesus Christ).
A Wednesday Crucifixion of Jesus allows for him to be in the tomb ("heart of the earth") for three days and three nights as he told the Pharisees he would be (Matthew 12:40), rather than two nights and a day if he had died on a Friday.
Preparation Day (14 Nisan on the Hebrew calendar) – which is the day before Passover (15 Nisan), instead of the Friday morning as the Synoptic Gospels refer to the sabbath and they believe this refers to a "high sabbath" which occurs on feast days, and not the ordinary weekly sabbath.
========,2,Associated customs.
In many countries with a strong Christian tradition such as Australia, Bermuda, Brazil, Canada, the countries of the Caribbean, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Finland, Germany, Malta, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, the Philippines, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and Venezuela, the day is observed as a public or federal holiday.
In the United States, 12 states observe Good Friday as state holiday: Connecticut, Texas, Delaware, Hawaii, Indiana, Tennessee, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina and North Dakota.
Germany and some other countries have laws prohibiting certain acts, such as dancing and horse racing, that are seen as profaning the solemn nature of the day.
========,3,Australia.
Good Friday is a holiday under state and territory laws in all states and territories in Australia.
Generally speaking, shops in all Australian states (but not in the two territories of Northern Territory and the ACT) are required to remain closed for the duration of Good Friday, although there are certain shops which are permitted to open and other shops can apply for exemptions.
All schools and universities close on Good Friday in Australia, and Good Friday falls within the school holidays in most years in all states and territories except the Northern Territory, although many states now commence their school holidays in early April regardless of Easter.
In 2016, for example, when Good Friday falls on March 25, only Queensland and Victoria have school holidays which coincide with Good Friday.
The vast majority of businesses are closed on Good Friday, although many recreational businesses, such as the Sydney Royal Easter Show, open on Good Friday as among non-religious families Good Friday is a popular day to indulge in such activities.
========,3,Canada.
In Canada, Good Friday is a federal statutory holiday.
In the province of Quebec "employers can choose to give the day off either on Good Friday or Easter Monday."
========,3,Cuba.
In an online article posted on Catholic News Agency by Alejandro Bermúdez on 31 March 2012, Cuban President Raúl Castro, with the Communist Party and his advisers, decreed that Good Friday that year would be a holiday.
This was Castro's response to a request made personally to him by Pope Benedict XVI during the latter's Apostolic Visitation to the island and León, Mexico that month.
The move followed the pattern of small advances in Cuba's relations with the Vatican, mirroring Pope John Paul II's success in getting Fidel Castro to declare Christmas Day a holiday.
Both Good Friday and Christmas are now annual holidays in Cuba.
========,3,Ireland.
In the Republic of Ireland, Good Friday is not an official public holiday, but most non-retail businesses close for the day.
As a predominantly observant Catholic country, religious ceremonies are well attended.
It is illegal to sell alcoholic beverages on Good Friday, with some exceptions, so pubs and off-licences generally close.
Retail businesses that sell alcohol such as supermarkets are required by law to physically block access to the aisle(s) that display alcohol for the day by ways such as Stanchion systems (Irish supermarkets are designed so that it is not necessary to pass through alcohol aisles to get to non-alcohol products).
Critics of the ban include the catering and tourism sector, but public surveys indicate substantial support.
In Northern Ireland, a similar ban operates until 5pm on Good Friday.
========,3,Malta.
The Holy Week commemorations reach their peak on Good Friday as the Roman Catholic Church celebrates the passion of Jesus.
Solemn celebrations take place in all churches together with processions in different villages around Malta and Gozo.
During the celebration, the narrative of the passion is read in some localities, while the Adoration of the Cross follows.
Good Friday processions take place in Birgu, Bormla, Għaxaq, Luqa, Mosta, Naxxar, Paola, Qormi, Rabat, Senglea, Valletta, Żebbuġ (Città Rohan) and Żejtun.
Processions in Gozo will be in Nadur, Victoria (St. George and Cathedral), Xagħra and Żebbuġ, Gozo.
========,3,Philippines.
In the predominantly Roman Catholic Philippines, the day is commemorated with street processions, the Way of the Cross, the chanting of the "Pasyón", and performances of the "Senákulo" or Passion play.
Some devotees engage in self-flagellation and even have themselves crucified as expressions of penance despite health risks and strong disapproval from the Church.
Church bells are not rung and Masses are not celebrated, while television features movies, documentaries and other shows focused on the religious event and other topics related to the Catholic faith, broadcasting mostly religious content.
Malls and shops are generally closed, as are restaurants as it is the second of three public holidays within the week.
After three o'clock in the afternoon (the time at which Jesus is traditionally believed to have died), the faithful venerate the cross in the local church and follow the procession of the Burial of Jesus.
The image of the dead Christ is then laid in state to be venerated, and sometimes treated in accordance with local burial customs.
In Cebu and many parts of the Visayan Islands, people usually eat "binignit" and "biko" as a form of fasting.
========,3,United Kingdom.
In the UK, Good Friday was historically a common law holiday and is recognised as an official public holiday (a.k.a.
Bank Holiday).
All state schools are closed and most businesses treat it as a holiday for staff; however, many retail stores now remain open.
Government services in Northern Ireland operate as normal on Good Friday, substituting Easter Tuesday for the holiday.
There has traditionally been no horse racing on Good Friday in the UK.
However, in 2008, betting shops and stores opened for the first time on this day and in 2014 Lingfield Park and Musselburgh staged the UK's first Good Friday race meetings.
The BBC has for many years introduced its 7 am News broadcast on Radio 4 on Good Friday with a verse from Isaac Watts' hymn "When I Survey the Wondrous Cross".
========,3,United States.
In the United States, Good Friday is not a government holiday at the federal level; however, individual states, counties and municipalities may observe the holiday.
Good Friday is a state holiday in Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky (half day), Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota, Tennessee and Texas.
State and local government offices and courts are closed, as well as some banks and post offices in these states, and in those counties and municipalities where Good Friday is observed as a holiday.
Good Friday is also a holiday in the U.S. territories of Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.
The stock markets are closed on Good Friday but the foreign exchange and bond trading markets open for a partial business day.
Most retail stores remain open, while some of them may close early.
Public schools and universities are often closed on Good Friday, either as a holiday of its own, or as part of spring break.
The postal service operates, and banks regulated by the federal government do not close for Good Friday.
In some governmental contexts Good Friday has been referred to by a generic name such as "spring holiday".
In 1999, in the case of Bridenbaugh v. O'Bannon, an Indiana state employee sued the governor for giving state employees Good Friday as a day off.
The US Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the plaintiff, stating that the government could give state employees a paid day off when that day is a religious holiday, including Good Friday, but only so long as the state can provide a valid secular purpose that coincides with the obvious religious purpose of the holiday.
========,2,Calculating the date.
Good Friday is the Friday before Easter, which is calculated differently in Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity (see Computus for details).
Easter falls on the first Sunday following the Paschal Full Moon, the full moon on or after 21 March, taken to be the date of the vernal equinox.
The Western calculation uses the Gregorian calendar, while the Eastern calculation uses the Julian calendar, whose 21 March now corresponds to the Gregorian calendar's 3 April.
The calculations for identifying the date of the full moon also differ.
See Computus.
In Eastern Christianity, Easter can fall between 22 March and 25 April on Julian Calendar (thus between 4 April and 8 May in terms of the Gregorian calendar, during the period 1900 and 2099), so Good Friday can fall between 20 March and 23 April, inclusive (or between 2 April and 6 May in terms of the Gregorian calendar).
