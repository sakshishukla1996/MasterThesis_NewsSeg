The Mayor of New York City is the chief executive of New York City's government, as stipulated by New York City's charter.
The current mayor, the 109th in the sequence of regular mayors, is Bill de Blasio, a Democrat.
During the Dutch colonial period from 1624 to 1664, New Amsterdam was governed by the Director of New Netherland.
The office of Mayor of New York was established in 1665 and were appointed by colonial governors until 1777.
The year prior, New York was run by Richard Nicolls, the British military governor of the Province of New York.
Thomas Willett was the first person to be specifically appointed mayor.
In 1777, during the American Revolution, a Council of Appointment was formed by the State of New York.
In 1821 the New York City Council – then known as the Common Council – began appointing mayors.
Since 1834, mayors have been elected by direct popular vote.
Before 1898, the city included little beyond the island of Manhattan.
The 1898 consolidation created the city as it is today with five boroughs: Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island.
The longest-serving mayors have been Fiorello H. La Guardia (1934–1945), Robert F. Wagner, Jr. (1954–1965), Ed Koch (1978–1989), and Michael Bloomberg (2002–2013) each of whom was in office for twelve years (three successive 4-year terms).
The shortest terms in office since 1834 have been those of acting mayors: Thomas Coman (five weeks from Monday, November 30, 1868, to Monday, January 4, 1869) and Samuel B. H. Vance (one month from November 30 to December 31, 1874), in addition to the purely nominal single day that William T. Collins served in 1925.
Every mayor so far has been white, with the solitary exception of David Dinkins (1990–1993), the city's first and only African American mayor.
New York has not had a Hispanic or Latino mayor, with the possible exception of John Purroy Mitchel (1914–1917), who was of Spanish descent and whose grandfather was born in Venezuela.
New York's mayors have been religiously diverse; the city has had Protestant, Jewish, and Catholic mayors.
No woman has ever served as mayor of New York City.

========,2,Post-consolidation mayors.
The 1898–1901 term was for four years.
The City Charter was changed to make the mayor's term a two-year one beginning in 1902, but after two such terms was changed back to resume four-year terms in 1906.
George B. McClellan, Jr. thus served one two-year term from 1904 to 1905, during which he was elected to a four-year term from 1906 to 1909.
