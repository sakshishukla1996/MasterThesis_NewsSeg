========,1,preface.
In mathematics, a singularity is in general a point at which a given mathematical object is not defined, or a point of an exceptional set where it fails to be well-behaved in some particular way, such as differentiability.
See Singularity theory for general discussion of the geometric theory, which only covers some aspects.
For example, the function on the real line has a singularity at "x" = 0, where it seems to "explode" to ±∞ and is not defined.
The function "g"("x") = |"x"| (see absolute value) also has a singularity at "x" = 0, since it is not differentiable there.
The algebraic set defined by ***formula*** in the ("x", "y") coordinate system has a singularity (singular point) at (0, 0) because it does not admit a tangent there.

========,3,Coordinate singularities.
A coordinate singularity (or coördinate singularity) occurs when an apparent singularity or discontinuity occurs in one coordinate frame, which can be removed by choosing a different frame.
An example is the apparent singularity at the 90 degree latitude in spherical coordinates.
An object moving due north (for example, along the line 0 degrees longitude) on the surface of a sphere will suddenly experience an instantaneous change in longitude at the pole (in the case of the example, jumping from longitude 0 to longitude 180 degrees).
This discontinuity, however, is only apparent; it is an artifact of the coordinate system chosen, which is singular at the poles.
A different coordinate system would eliminate the apparent discontinuity, e.g.
by replacing latitude/longitude with n-vector.

Other than isolated singularities, complex functions of one variable may exhibit other singular behaviour.
Namely, two kinds of nonisolated singularities exist:

========,2,Algebraic geometry and commutative algebra.
In algebraic geometry, a singularity of an algebraic variety is a point of the variety where the tangent space may not be regularly defined.
The simplest example of singularities are curves that cross themselves.
But there are other types of singularities, like cusps.
For example, the equation defines a curve that has a cusp at the origin .
One could define the -axis as a tangent at this point, but this definition can not be the same as the definition at other points.
In fact, in this case, the -axis is a "double tangent."
For affine and projective varieties, the singularities are the points where the Jacobian matrix has a rank which is lower than at other points of the variety.
An equivalent definition in terms of commutative algebra may be given, which extends to abstract varieties and schemes: A point is "singular" if the local ring at this point is not a regular local ring.
