========,2,History.
When counties were established in New York State in 1683, the present Warren County was part of Albany County.
The county was enormous, covering the northern part of New York State, all of the present State of Vermont, and, in theory, extended westward to the Pacific Ocean.
It was reduced in size on July 3, 1766 by the creation of Cumberland County, and further on March 16, 1770 by the creation of Gloucester County, both containing territory now in Vermont.
On March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County.
One of the other pieces, Charlotte County (named for Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, queen-consort of King George the Third of England), contained the eastern portion.
In 1778, the name Charlotte County was changed to Washington County to honor George Washington, the American Revolutionary War general and later President of the United States of America.
In 1788, Washington County was reduced in size by the splitting-off of Clinton County.
This was a much larger area than the present Clinton County, including several other counties or county parts of the present New York State.
Washington County was slightly enlarged by the transfer of the Town of Cambridge from Albany County to Washington County in 1791.
In 1813, Warren County was split off from Washington County, receiving its name in honor of General Joseph Warren.
