========,1,preface.
Charades (, ) is a parlor or party word guessing game.
Originally, the game was a dramatic form of literary charades: a single person would act out each syllable of a word or phrase in order, followed by the whole phrase together, while the rest of the group guessed.
A variant was to have teams who acted scenes out together while the others guessed.
Today, it is common to require the actors to mime their hints without using any spoken words, which requires some conventional gestures.
Puns and visual puns were and remain common.
========,2,History.
A charade was a form of literary riddle popularized in France in the 18th century where each syllable of the answer was described enigmatically as a separate word before the word as a whole was similarly described.
William Mackworth Praed's poetic charades became famous.
In the early 20th century, the 11th edition of the "Encyclopædia Britannica" offered these two prose charades as "perhaps as good as could be selected":
and with the answers being tartar and conundrum.
In the early 19th century, the French began performing "acting" or "acted charades"—with the written description replaced by dramatic performances as a parlor game—and this was brought over to Britain by the English aristocracy.
William Makepeace Thackeray snarked that it was enjoyed for "enabling the many ladies amongst us who had beauty to display their charms, and the fewer number who had cleverness, to exhibit their wit".
In his "Vanity Fair", the height of Rebecca Sharp's social success is brought on by her performances of acting charades before the Prince Regent.
The first scene—"first two syllables"—displays a Turkish lord dealing with a slaver and his odalisque before being garroted by the sultan's chief black eunuch; the second—"last two syllables"—finds a Turk, his consort, and his black slave praying at sunrise when an enormous Egyptian head enters and begins singing.
The answer—Agamemnon—is then acted out by Becky's husband, while she makes her (first) appearance as Clytemnestra.
After refreshments, another round begins, partially in pantomime: the first scene shows a household yawningly finishing a game of cribbage and preparing for bed; the second opens on the household bustling with activity as daybreak prompts bells ringing, arguments over receipts, collection of the chamber pots, calls for carriages, and greetings to new guests; the third closes with a ship's crew and passengers tossed about by a storm with strong winds.
The answer—nightingale—is then (somewhat mistakenly) acted out by Becky in the role of a singing French marquise, recalling both Lacoste's 1705 tragic opera "Philomèle" and an "arriviste" lover and wife of Louis XIV.
Apart from its importance in the book, the scenes were subsequently considered models of the genre.
By the time of the First World War, "acting charades" had become the most popular form and, as written charades were forgotten, it adopted its present, terser name.
Thackeray's scenes—even those said to be "in pantomime"—included dialogue from the actors but truly "dumb" or "mime charades" gradually became more popular as well and similarly dropped their descriptive adjectives.
The amateurish acting involved in charades led to the word's use to describe any obvious or inept deception, but over time "a charade" became used more broadly for any put-on (even highly competent and successful ones) and its original association with the parlor game has largely been lost.
The acted form of charades has been repeatedly made into television game shows, including the American "Play the Game", "Movietown, RSVP", "Pantomime Quiz" and "Stump the Stars", "Celebrity Charades", and "Showoffs" and "Body Language"; the British "Give Us a Clue"; the Canadian "Party Game" and "Acting Crazy"; and the Australian "Celebrity Game".
On Britain's BBC Radio 4, "I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue" performs a variant of the old written and spoken form of the game as "Sound Charades".
========,2,Rules.
As a long-lived and informal game, charades' rules can vary widely.
Common features of the game include holding up a number of fingers to indicate the number of syllables in the answer, silently replying to questions, and making a "come on" gesture once the guesses become close; some forms of the games, however, forbid anything except physically acting out the answer.
In a mixed setting, it is therefore advisable to clarify the rules before play begins.
Common features of the modern game include:
