========,1,preface.
The Drones Club is a recurring fictional location in the stories of British comic writer P. G. Wodehouse.
It is a gentlemen's club in London.
Many of his Jeeves and Blandings Castle stories feature the club or its members.
The name "Drones" has been used by several real-life clubs and restaurants.
========,2,Overview.
The Drones Club is in Mayfair, London, located in Dover Street, off Piccadilly.
A drone being a male bee that does no work, living off the labour of others, it aptly describes the contemporary Edwardian stereotype of rich, idle young club members.
At the same time, though, it should be pointed out that many prominent members had useful occupations.
Pongo Twistleton, for example, was reading for the Bar, and other members were mentioned as holding down jobs.
Wodehouse based the Drones Club on a combination of three real London clubs: the Bachelors' Club (existed around the turn of the century), then mostly Buck's Club (established 1919), and a dash of the Bath Club for its swimming pool's ropes and rings.
The fictional Drones barman, McGarry, has the same surname as the Buck's first bartender, a Mr McGarry (Buck's barman from 1919 to 1941, credited with creating the Buck's Fizz and Sidecar cocktails).
However Evelyn Waugh declared that the Drones did not resemble any real club in 1920s London.
A real club has been based at 40 Dover Street since 1893, The Arts Club.
Other gentlemen's clubs which have existed on Dover Street, but are now dissolved, include the Bath Club, the Junior Naval and Military Club, and the Scottish Club, as well as two mixed-sex clubs, the Albemarle Club and the Empress Club.
None of these were ever considered among London's 'premier' clubs of the kind found on St James's Street and Pall Mall, and so their ambience often had something of the raucous informality of the fictional Drones Club.
About a dozen club members are major or secondary recurring characters in the Wodehouse stories.
In addition to Bertie Wooster (Jeeves stories), Pongo Twistleton (Uncle Fred stories), Rupert Psmith (Psmith stories), and Freddie Threepwood (Blandings stories), prominent recurring drones include Bingo Little and Freddie Widgeon, plus Monty Bodkin, Barmy Fotheringay-Phipps, Tuppy Glossop, Catsmeat Potter-Pirbright, Archibald Mulliner, and the club millionaire Oofy Prosser.
========,2,Eggs, Beans, and Crumpets.
Most of the Drones short stories are also "Eggs, Beans, and Crumpets stories", as Wodehouse divides the club members into "Eggs", "Beans", and "Crumpets".
This is allegedly based on the habit they have of addressing each other as "old egg", "old bean", or "my dear old crumpet" ... although, in fact, no character in the stories actually addresses another character by these nicknames.
A few later stories introduce a fourth subset of Drones Club members known as "Piefaces".
Many of the Drones Club stories begin with unnamed members of The Drones Club talking about the latest exploits of Freddie Widgeon, Pongo Twistleton, Bingo Little, or another of their number.
The story then transitions into a particularly well-informed Crumpet detailing the specifics of tale to an uninformed Egg or Bean:
Wodehouse had already used this technique in the stories told by his Mr Mulliner, who refers to his anonymous interlocutors by the name of their drink.
========,2,Members.
The total number of members is not established.
At the Drones Club weekend in Le Touquet, France, were "about 87 members", and not all of them crossed the Channel (such as Pongo Twistleton and Horace Pendlebury-Davenport).
Comparatively, only a few Drones have been depicted:
