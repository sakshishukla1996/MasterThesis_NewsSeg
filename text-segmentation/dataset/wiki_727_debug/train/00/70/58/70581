St. John's is the capital and largest city in Newfoundland and Labrador.
It is on the eastern tip of the Avalon Peninsula on the island of Newfoundland.
St. John's covers and is North America's most easterly city, excluding those of Greenland.
Its name has been attributed to the Nativity of John the Baptist, when John Cabot was believed to have sailed into the harbour in 1497 and to a Basque fishing town with the same name.
Existing on maps as early as 1519, it is the oldest city in North America.
It was officially incorporated as a city in 1888.
With a metropolitan population of approximately 214,000 (as of July 1, 2015), the St. John's Metropolitan Area is Canada's 20th largest metropolitan area and the second largest Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) in Atlantic Canada, after Halifax.
The city has a rich history, having played a role in the Seven Years' War, the French and Indian War, the American Revolutionary War, and the War of 1812.
Italian inventor, Guglielmo Marconi received the first transatlantic wireless signal in St. John's.
Its history and culture have made it one of the world's top ocean-side tourist destinations.
========,2,History.
========,3,16th and 17th centuries.
St. John's is one of North America's oldest European settlements, with fishermen setting up seasonal camps in the early 16th century.
Sebastian Cabot declares in a handwritten Latin text in his original 1545 map, that St. John's earned its name when he and his father, the Venetian explorer John Cabot became the first Europeans to sail into the harbour, in the morning of 24 June 1494 (against British and French historians stating 1497), the feast day of Saint John the Baptist.
However, the locations of Cabot's landfalls are disputed.
A series of expeditions to St. John's by Portuguese from the Azores took place in the early 16th century, and by 1540 French, Spanish and Portuguese ships crossed the Atlantic annually to fish the waters off the Avalon Peninsula.
In the Basque Country, it is a common belief the name of St. John's was given by Basque fishermen because the bay of St. John's is very similar to the Bay of Pasaia in the Basque Country, where one of the fishing towns is called St. John (in Spanish, San Juan, and in Basque, Donibane).
The earliest record of the location appears as São João on a Portuguese map by Pedro Reinel in 1519.
When John Rut visited St. John's in 1527 he found Norman, Breton and Portuguese ships in the harbour.
On 3 August 1527, Rut wrote a letter to King Henry on the findings of his voyage to North America; this was the first known letter sent from North America.
St. Jehan is shown on Nicholas Desliens' world map of 1541 and San Joham is found in João Freire's Atlas of 1546.
It was during this time that Water Street was first developed, making it the oldest street in North America.
On 5 August 1583, an English Sea Dog, Sir Humphrey Gilbert claimed the area as England's first overseas colony under Royal Charter of Queen Elizabeth I.
There was no permanent population, however, and Gilbert was lost at sea during his return voyage, thereby ending any immediate plans for settlement.
The Newfoundland National War Memorial is on the waterfront in St. John's, at the purported site of Gilbert's landing and proclamation.
By 1620, the fishermen of England's West Country controlled most of Newfoundland's east coast.
In 1627, William Payne, called St. John's "the principal prime and chief lot in all the whole country."
Sometime after 1630, the town of St. John's was established as a permanent community.
Before this they were expressly forbidden by the British government, at the urging of the West Country fishing industry, from establishing permanent settlements along the English controlled coast.
The population grew slowly in the 17th century: St. John's was Newfoundland's largest settlement when English naval officers began to take censuses around 1675.
The population grew in the summers with the arrival of migratory fishermen.
In 1680, fishing ships (mostly from South Devon) set up fishing rooms at St. John's, bringing hundreds of Irish men into the port to operate inshore fishing boats.
The town's first significant defenses were likely erected due to commercial interests, following the temporary seizure of St. John's by the Dutch admiral Michiel de Ruyter in June 1665.
The inhabitants fended off a second Dutch attack in 1673, when it was defended by Christopher Martin, an English merchant captain.
Martin landed six cannons from his vessel, the "Elias Andrews", and constructed an earthen breastwork and battery near Chain Rock commanding the Narrows leading into the harbour.
With only 23 men, the valiant Martin beat off an attack by three Dutch warships.
The English government planned to expand these fortifications (Fort William) in around 1689, but construction didn't begin until after the French admiral Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville captured and destroyed the town in the Avalon Peninsula Campaign (1696).
When 1500 English reinforcements arrived in late 1697, they found rubble where the town and fortifications had stood.
========,4,The oldest European settlement in North America controversy.
There has been some controversy regarding which European settlement is the oldest in North America.
As mentioned above, while English fishermen had set up seasonal camps in St. John's in the 16th century, they were expressly forbidden by the British government, at the urging of the West Country fishing industry, from establishing permanent settlements along the English controlled coast.
As a result, the town of St. John's was not established as a 'permanent' community until after the 1630s.
With respect to the oldest surviving permanent English settlements in North America, it was preceded by Jamestown, Virginia (1607), the Cuper's Cove colony at Cupids (1610), St. George's, Bermuda (1612) and the Bristol's Hope colony at Harbour Grace (1618).
========,3,18th and 19th centuries.
The French attacked St. John's again in 1705 (Siege of St. John's), and captured it in 1708 (Battle of St. John's), devastating civilian structures with fire on each instance.
The harbour remained fortified through most of the 18th and 19th centuries.
The final battle of the Seven Years' War in North America (the French and Indian War) was fought in 1762, in St. John's.
Following a surprise capture of the town by the French early in the year, the British responded and, at the Battle of Signal Hill, the French surrendered St. John's to British forces under the command of Colonel William Amherst.
The 18th century saw major changes in Newfoundland: population growth, beginnings of government, establishment of churches, reinforcement of commercial ties with North America and development of the seal, salmon and Grand Banks fisheries.
St. John's population grew slowly.
Although it was primarily a fishing station, it was also a garrison, a centre of government and a commercial hub.
St. John's served as a naval base during the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812.
The core of the city was destroyed by fire several times, the most famous of which was the Great Fire of 1892.
========,3,20th and 21st centuries.
Guglielmo Marconi received the first transatlantic wireless signal in St. John's on 12 December 1901 from his wireless station in Poldhu, Cornwall.
St. John's was the starting point for the first non-stop transatlantic aircraft flight, by Alcock and Brown in a modified Vickers Vimy IV bomber, in June 1919, departing from Lester's Field in St. John's and ending in a bog near Clifden, Connemara, Ireland.
In July 2005, the flight was duplicated by American aviator and adventurer Steve Fossett in a replica Vickers Vimy aircraft, with St. John's International Airport substituting for Lester's Field (now an urban and residential part of the city).
During the Second World War, the harbour supported Royal Navy and Royal Canadian Navy ships that were engaged in anti-submarine warfare.
It was the site of an American Army Air Force base, Fort Pepperrell, that was established as part of the "Lend-Lease" agreement between the United Kingdom and United States.
The base was transferred to Canadian control in 1960 and is now known as CFS St. John's.
The Knights of Columbus Hostel fire in December 1942 saw 99 military and civilian lives lost.
St. John's, and the province as a whole, was gravely affected in the 1990s by the collapse of the northern cod fishery, which had been the driving force of the provincial economy for hundreds of years.
After a decade of high unemployment rates and depopulation, the city's proximity to the Hibernia, Terra Nova and White Rose oil fields led to an economic boom that spurred population growth and commercial development.
As a result, the St. John's area now accounts for about half of the province's economic output.
As of 2012, St. John's contained 21 National Historic Sites of Canada.
St. John's is serviced by one major airport.
It has daily direct service to Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Gander, Deer Lake, Wabush, Goose Bay and Halifax and seasonal service direct to Calgary, Dublin and London.
========,2,Geography.
St. John's is along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, on the northeast of the Avalon Peninsula in southeast Newfoundland.
The city covers and is North America's most easterly city, excluding Greenland; it is closer to London, England than it is to Edmonton, Alberta.
The city of St. John's is a distance by air of from Lorient, France which lies on a nearly identical latitude across the Atlantic on the French western coast.
The city is the largest in the province and the second largest in the Atlantic Provinces after Halifax, Nova Scotia.
Its downtown area lies to the west and north of St. John's Harbour, and the rest of the city expands from the downtown to the north, south, east and west.
Coniferous trees such as black spruce, white spruce, and balsam fir dominate the native vegetation.
The largest deciduous tree is white birch; species of lesser stature include alder, cherry and mountain ash.
Of introduced tree species, sycamore maple is most abundant and Norway maple is common.
Blue spruce, common horsechestnut, European beech and littleleaf linden are among the other non-native species grown.
========,3,Climate.
St. John's has a humid continental climate (Köppen "Dfb"), with lower seasonal variation than normal for the latitude, which is due to Gulf Stream moderation.
Despite this maritime moderation, average January maximum temperatures are slightly lower in St. John's than in Kelowna, British Columbia, an inland city that is near the more marine air of the Pacific, demonstrating the cold nature of Eastern Canada.
Mean temperatures range from in February to in August, showing somewhat of a seasonal lag in the climate.
The city is also one of the areas of the country most prone to tropical cyclone activity, as it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, where tropical storms (and sometimes hurricanes) travel from the United States.
The city is one of the rainiest in Canada outside of coastal British Columbia.
This is partly due to its propensity for tropical storm activity as well as moist, Atlantic air frequently blowing ashore and creating precipitation.
Of major Canadian cities, St. John's is the foggiest (124 days), windiest ( average speed), and cloudiest (1,497 hours of sunshine).
Precipitation is frequent and often heavy, falling year round.
On average, summer is the driest season, with only occasional thunderstorm activity, and the wettest months are from October to January, with December the wettest single month, with nearly 165 millimetres of precipitation on average.
This winter precipitation maximum is unusual for humid continental climates, which typically have a late spring or early summer precipitation maximum (for example, most of the Midwestern U.S.).
Most heavy precipitation events in St. John's are the product of intense mid-latitude storms from the Northeastern U.S. and New England states, and these are most common and intense from October to March, bringing heavy precipitation (commonly 4 to 8 centimetres of rainfall equivalent in a single storm), and strong winds.
In winter, two or more types of precipitation (rain, freezing rain, sleet and snow) can fall from passage of a single storm.
Snowfall is heavy, averaging nearly 335 centimetres per winter season.
However, winter storms can bring changing precipitation types.
Heavy snow can turn into heavy rain, melting the snow cover, and possibly back to snow or ice (perhaps briefly) all in the same storm, resulting in little or no net snow accumulation.
Snow cover in St. John's is variable, and especially early in the winter season, may be slow to develop, but can extend well into the spring months (March, April).
The St. John's area is subject to freezing rain (called "silver thaws"), the worst of which paralyzed the city over a three-day period in April 2017.
The highest temperature ever recorded in St. John's was on 14 August 1876.
The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 16 February 1875.
========,2,Cityscape.
========,3,Architecture.
St. John's architecture has a distinct style from the rest of Canada, and its major buildings are remnants of its history as one of the first British colonial capitals.
Buildings took a variety of styles according to the means available to build them.
Starting as a fishing outpost for European fishermen, St. John's consisted mostly of the homes of fishermen, sheds, storage shacks, and wharves constructed out of wood.
Like many other cities of the time, as the Industrial Revolution took hold and new methods and materials for construction were introduced, the landscape changed as the city grew.
The Great Fire of 1892 destroyed most of the downtown core, and most residential and other wood-frame buildings date from this period.
Often compared to San Francisco due to the hilly terrain and steep maze of residential streets, housing in St. John's is typically painted in bright colours.
The city council has implemented strict heritage regulations in the downtown area, including restrictions on the height of buildings.
These regulations have caused much controversy over the years.
With the city experiencing an economic boom a lack of hotel rooms and office space has seen proposals put forward that do not meet the current height regulations.
Heritage advocates argue the current regulations should be enforced while others believe the regulations should be relaxed to encourage economic development.
To meet the need for more office space downtown without compromising the city's heritage, the city council amended heritage regulations, which originally restricted height to 15 metres in the area of land on Water Street between Bishop's Cove and Steer's Cove, to create the "Commercial Central Retail – West Zone".
The new zone will allow for buildings of greater height.
A 47-metre, 12-storey office building, which includes retail space and a parking garage, was the first building to be approved in this area.
========,2,Demographics.
As of the 2006 Census, there were 100,646 inhabitants in St. John's itself, 151,322 in the urban area and 181,113 in the St. John's Census Metropolitan Area (CMA).
Thus, St. John's is Newfoundland and Labrador's largest city and Canada's 20th largest CMA.
Apart from St. John's, the CMA includes 12 other communities: the city of Mount Pearl and the towns of Conception Bay South, Paradise, Portugal Cove-St. Philip's, Torbay, Logy Bay-Middle Cove-Outer Cove, Pouch Cove, Flatrock, Bay Bulls, Witless Bay, Petty Harbour-Maddox Cove and Bauline.
The population of the CMA was 192,326 as of 1 July 2010.
As of 2011, there were 4,205 members of visible minorities in the city.
The largest visible minority group were South Asians (1.2%), followed by Chinese Canadian (1.0%), and Blacks (0.9%).
There were 4,305 Aboriginals in St. John's, comprising 4.1% of the city's population.
First Nations people made up 2.9% of the city's population, Inuit comprised 0.8% of St. John's population, and 0.6% were Métis.
========,3,Religion.
"The information below is from the 2001 Canadian Census."
and the National Household Survey 2011 Predominantly Christian, the population of St. John's was once divided along sectarian (Catholic/Protestant) lines.
In recent years, this sectarianism has declined significantly, and is no longer a commonly acknowledged facet of life in St. John's.
St. John's is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archbishop of St. John's, and the Anglican Bishop of Eastern Newfoundland and Labrador.
All major Christian sects showed a decline from 2001–2011 with a large increase in those with no religion from 3.9% to 11.1%.
========,2,Economy.
St. John's economy is connected to both its role as the provincial capital of Newfoundland and Labrador and to the ocean.
The civil service which is supported by the federal, provincial and municipal governments has been the key to the expansion of the city's labour force and to the stability of its economy, which supports a sizable retail, service and business sector.
The provincial government is the largest employer in the city, followed by Memorial University.
With the collapse of the fishing industry in Newfoundland and Labrador in the 1990s, the role of the ocean is now tied to what lies beneath it – oil and gas – as opposed to what swims in or travels across it.
The city is the centre of the oil and gas industry in Eastern Canada and is one of 19 World Energy Cities.
ExxonMobil Canada is headquartered in St. John's and companies such as Chevron, Husky Energy, Suncor Energy and Statoil have major regional operations in the city.
Three major offshore oil developments, Hibernia, Terra Nova and White Rose, are in production off the coast of the city and a fourth development, Hebron, is expected to be producing oil by 2017.
The economy has been growing quickly in recent years.
In 2010 and 2011, the metro area's gross domestic product (GDP) led 27 other metropolitan areas in the country, according to the Conference Board of Canada, recording growth of 6.6 per cent and 5.8 per cent respectively.
At $52,000 the city's per capita GDP is the second highest out of all major Canadian cities.
Economic forecasts suggest that the city will continue its strong economic growth in the coming years not only in the "oceanic" industries mentioned above, but also in tourism and new home construction as the population continues to grow.
In May 2011, the city's unemployment rate fell to 5.6 per cent, the second lowest unemployment rate for a major city in Canada.
St. John's is also becoming known as an entrepreneurial city.
In a 2009 report by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, "Communities in Boom: Canada’s Top Entrepreneurial Cities", St. John's was ranked the best major city in Atlantic Canada and 19th overall in Canada for providing a good environment for small business development.
========,2,Arts and culture.
The downtown area is the cultural hub of St. John's and is a major tourist destination in Newfoundland and Labrador and Atlantic Canada.
Water Street and Duckworth Street are known for their brightly coloured low rise heritage buildings, housing numerous tourist shops, clothing boutiques, and restaurants.
George Street, a downtown side-street above the western end of Water Street, is the predominant home of the city's nightlife.
It holds numerous annual festivals including the George Street Festival in August and the Mardi Gras Festival in October.
The street can be credited with kick-starting the careers of many musical acts and is busy nearly every night of the week.
The city has a symphony orchestra, a string quartet, and several choirs.
In addition the School of Music of Memorial University of Newfoundland has several ensembles, including a chamber orchestra.
St. Johns also plays host to the Tuckamore Festival of chamber music, which has been held every August since 2001.
Opera on the Avalon puts on performances of opera, over several days, in the summer The LSPU Hall is home to the Resource Centre for the Arts.
The "Hall" hosts a vibrant and diverse arts community and is regarded as the backbone of artistic infrastructure and development in the downtown.
The careers of many well-known Newfoundland artists were launched there including Rick Mercer, Mary Walsh, Cathy Jones, Andy Jones and Greg Thomey.
The St. John's Arts and Culture Centre houses an art gallery, libraries and a 1000-seat theatre, which is the city's major venue for entertainment productions.
The Nickel Film Festival and the St. John's International Women's Film Festival are two independent film festivals held annually in St. John's.
========,2,Attractions.
========,3,Museums.
The Provincial Museum of Newfoundland and Labrador (c. 1892–93) was located on Duckworth Street in a building designated as a heritage site by the City of St. John's.
In 2005 the museum, along with the Art Gallery of Newfoundland and Labrador and the Provincial Archives of Newfoundland and Labrador, moved into The Rooms.
The Rooms is Newfoundland and Labrador's cultural facility, and is located in the downtown area.

========,3,Urban parks.
Pippy Park is an urban park in the east end of the city; with over of land, it is one of Canada's largest urban parks.
The park contains a range of recreational facilities including two golf courses, Newfoundland and Labrador's largest serviced campground, walking and skiing trails as well as protected habitat for many plants and animals.
Pippy Park is also home to the Fluvarium, an environmental education centre which offers a cross section view of Nagle's Hill Brook.
Bowring Park, located in the Waterford Valley, is one of the most scenic parks in St. John's.
Entrance to the park is via Waterford Bridge Road, passing a sculptured duck pond and a statue of Peter Pan.
The park land was donated to the city in 1911 by Sir Edgar Rennie Bowring on behalf of Bowring Brothers Ltd. on their 100th anniversary of commerce in Newfoundland.
The park was officially opened by His Royal Highness, the Duke of Connaught on 15 July 1914.
Bannerman Park is a Victorian-style park located near the downtown.
The park was officially opened in 1891 by Sir Alexander Bannerman, Governor of the Colony of Newfoundland who donated the land to create the park.
Today the park contains a public swimming pool, playground, a baseball diamond and many large open grassy areas.
Bannerman Park plays host to many festivals and sporting events, most notably the Newfoundland and Labrador Folk Festival and St. John's Peace-a-chord.
The park is also the finishing location for the annual Tely 10 Mile Road Race.

========,2,Sports.
St. John's has been home to several professional hockey franchises.
Until 2017 it was home to the St. John's IceCaps the minor league affiliate of the Montreal Canadiens.
The St. John's Maple Leafs were the city's former American Hockey League (AHL) team.
Placed in St. John's in 1991, the team was lost during the 2004–2005 season to Toronto, Ontario due to the desire of its parent team, the Toronto Maple Leafs, to reduce travel costs and to have a tenant for its Ricoh Coliseum.
Shortly after the Maple Leafs were replaced by the St. John's Fog Devils of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL).
The team left St. John's in 2008 after just three seasons due to a poor lease arrangement with the city over the use of Mile One Centre and poor attendance.

It has two private schools, St. Bonaventure's College and Lakecrest Independent.
Atlantic Canada's largest university, Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN), is in St. John's.
MUN provides comprehensive education and grants degrees and its historical strengths in engineering, business, geology, and medicine make MUN one of the top comprehensive universities in Canada.
The Fisheries and Marine Institute of Memorial University of Newfoundland (MI or simply Marine Institute) is a post-secondary ocean and marine polytechnic in St. John's and is affiliated with Memorial University of Newfoundland.
MUN offers the lowest tuition in Canada ($2,644, per academic year).
The College of the North Atlantic (CNA) is the public college of the province and operates two main campuses in the city.
CNA provides career, trade, and university-transfer programs for St. John's residents.
The city hosts several private colleges and post-secondary schools; Academy Canada, Eastern College, and Keyin College are the largest of these.
========,2,Local media.
St. John's has one daily newspaper, "The Telegram".
Other local papers include "The Muse", "The Gazette", "Le Gaboteur", "The Scope", "The Business Post" and "The Current".
St. John's also receives the nationally distributed newspaper "The Globe and Mail".
CJON-DT, known on air as "NTV", is an independent station.
The station sublicenses entertainment programming from Global and news programming from CTV and Global, rather than purchasing primary broadcast rights.
Rogers Cable has its provincial headquarters in St. John's, and their community channel Rogers TV airs local shows such as "Out of the Fog" and "One Chef One Critic".
CBC has its Newfoundland and Labrador headquarters in the city and their television station CBNT-DT broadcasts from University Avenue.
The city is home to 15 am and FM radio stations, two of which are French-language stations.
St. John's is the only Canadian city served by radio stations whose call letters do not all begin with the letter "C".
The ITU prefix "VO" was assigned to the Dominion of Newfoundland before the province joined Canadian Confederation in 1949, and three AM stations kept their existing call letters.
However, other commercial radio stations in St. John's that went to air after 1949 use the same range of prefixes ("CF"–"CK") currently in use elsewhere in Canada, with the exception of VOCM-FM, which was permitted to adopt the VOCM callsign because of its corporate association with the AM station that already bore that callsign.
VO remains in use in amateur radio.
"allNewfoundlandLabrador" is the city's daily online newspaper, which focuses on business news from across the province.
