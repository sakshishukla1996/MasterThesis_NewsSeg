========,1,preface.
Sorghum is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae.
Seventeen of the twenty-five species are native to Australia, with the range of some extending to Africa, Asia, Mesoamerica, and certain islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.
One species is grown for grain, while many others are used as fodder plants, either cultivated in warm climates worldwide or naturalized, in pasture lands.
"Sorghum" is in the subfamily Panicoideae and the tribe Andropogoneae (the tribe of big bluestem and sugarcane).
========,2,Cultivation and uses.
One species, "Sorghum bicolor", native to Africa with many cultivated forms now, is an important crop worldwide, used for food (as grain and in sorghum syrup or "sorghum molasses"), animal fodder, the production of alcoholic beverages, and biofuels.
Most varieties are drought- and heat-tolerant, and are especially important in arid regions, where the grain is one of the staples for poor and rural people.
These varieties form important components of pastures in many tropical regions.
"S. bicolor" is an important food crop in Africa, Central America, and South Asia, and is the fifth-most important cereal crop grown in the world.
Some species of sorghum can contain levels of hydrogen cyanide, hordenine, and nitrates lethal to grazing animals in the early stages of the plants' growth.
When stressed by drought or heat, plants can also contain toxic levels of cyanide and/or nitrates at later stages in growth.
Another "Sorghum" species, Johnson grass ("S. halapense"), is classified as an invasive species in the US by the Department of Agriculture.
========,3,Research.
Sorghum is efficient in converting solar energy to chemical energy, and also uses less water compared to other grain crops.
Biofuel, using sweet sorghum as a high sugar content from its stalk for ethanol production, is being developed with biomass which can be turned into charcoal, syngas, and bio-oil.
========,2,Nutrition.
A 100 gram amount of raw sorghum provides 329 calories, 72% carbohydrates, 4% fat, and 11% protein (table).
Sorghum supplies numerous essential nutrients in rich content (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV), including protein; fiber; the B vitamins niacin, thiamin and vitamin B6; and several dietary minerals, including iron (26% DV) and manganese (76% DV) (table).
Sorghum nutrient contents generally are similar to those of raw oats (see nutrition table).
Among other similarities to oats, sorghum contains no gluten, making it useful for gluten-free diets.
