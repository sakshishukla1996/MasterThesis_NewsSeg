========,2,History and overview.
========,3,Early history.
The University of Calgary was established in 1966, but its roots date back more than half a century earlier to the establishment of the Normal School in Calgary in 1905.
The Alberta Normal School was established in Calgary to train primary and secondary school teachers in the new province.
The University of Alberta began operating a campus in Calgary in 1944.
The University of Alberta Calgary Branch eventually gained full autonomy in 1966 and became the University of Calgary.
The University of Calgary tartan is associated with the university and with its pipe band.
The university was modelled on the American state university (similar to the University of Alberta), with an emphasis on extension work and applied research.
The governance was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters.
The president, appointed by the board, was a link between the bodies to perform institutional leadership.
In the early 20th century, professional education expanded beyond theology, law and medicine.
Graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced.
The university's first president, Herbert Stoker Armstrong, held a strong belief that "although the university is accountable to the society that supports it, the university must insist on playing a leadership role in intellectual matters if it is to be worthy of the name."
During the late 1960s, the University of Calgary's campus expanded dramatically with new buildings for engineering and science, the opening of the new University Theatre in Calgary Hall and, in 1971, the launch of the program in architecture.
In addition, the Banff Centre (originally known as The Banff School of Fine Arts) affiliated with the University of Calgary in 1966.
The University of Calgary played a central role in facilitating and hosting the 1988 Winter Olympics.
========,2,Today.
The University of Calgary's Child Development Centre is Alberta's first building designed and constructed to LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) standards, the North American benchmark for environmentally high-performance buildings.
The facility, which houses the university's second child-care facility and a full continuum of researchers, clinicians and frontline workers, is dedicated to child health.
The building officially opened in October, 2007.
In 2011, an addition of rare neurology books dated over 500 years have been added to the MacKimmie library collection.
Canada's fifth veterinary school, the University of Calgary Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, was opened in mid-2008.
Research and graduate education programs will be focused on areas of strength and importance in Alberta and will fall in line with the college's areas of emphasis: production animal health, equine health, ecosystem and public health and investigative medicine.
The first class of Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) students started classes in the fall of 2008.

In 2011–2012 the university library was rated 43rd in North America for Total Library Expenditures by the Association of Research Libraries.
========,4,Taylor Family Digital Library.
The Taylor Family Digital Library (TFDL) is a convergence of libraries, historical archives, arts museum, scholarly publishing, and student academic support services.
The TFDL was officially launched on October 20, 2011.
The TFDL allows the full re-engineering of the university's library system, creating more and better space for teaching and learning resources, while moving the majority of the University of Calgary's growing collection off campus to a high-density library.
In addition, The TFDL offers books and online resources, a large Learning Commons with café, workrooms, film and audio rooms, editing and recording suites, multimedia labs, quiet study areas, and seminar and consultation space for academic growth.
Don and Ruth Taylor, longtime supporters of the University of Calgary, donated $25 million in December, 2006 to help build the new digital library.
In recognition of the gift, the Board of Governors of the University named the library the Taylor Family Digital Library (TFDL).
In addition, the gift will also be used to create the Taylor Quadrangle, a green space in the centre of campus adjacent to the TFDL.
The Taylor Family Digital Library is home to the Nickle Galleries, formerly known as the Nickle Arts Museum, which features exhibits of contemporary art, as well as rugs, textiles, and numismatic items from its collections.

========,2,Residence.
The University of Calgary offers a wide range of residences on campus as a significant proportion of undergraduate students reside on the campus.
The residence buildings on campus house 2200 students, situated in eight buildings named after mountains in the Canadian Rockies.
The two traditional buildings are Rundle Hall and Kananaskis Hall and were built in the early 1960s when the university relocated to its present campus.
Five newer buildings named Glacier, Olympus, Norquay, Brewster, and Castle Halls were built prior to the 1988 Winter Olympics as the athletes' Olympic Village.
However, each is smaller than the traditional buildings, being three or four stories tall and housing 10 to 30 students on each floor.
One of the newest, Cascade Hall, is five stories and is the third largest residence building, its floors being able to house more students.
The newest six buildings are all designed in the style of apartments with a hallway on each floor with sets of rooms that can accommodate up to four people each.
This is in contrast to the traditional buildings which have hallways on each floor, each having rooms accommodating two, along with a common area at the centre of the building on each floor.
Yamnuska Hall opens September 2011 to upper year, international, and transfer students.
The two and three bedroom suites are designed to ensure that students experience residence life by sharing space, but also ensures that each student has a private room.
A new building, "Dr. Fok Ying Tung International House" houses 200 international students, instructors and conference attendees.
In addition, a new residence for first year undergraduate students is due to be completed in 2011.
Construction of the new residence at the University of Calgary broke ground Friday, May 15, 2009.
This is part of the university's $1.5 billion capital program.
With the completion of this new building, the number of beds on campus will increase to 3000.
Efforts are being made to preserve green space wherever possible, which includes retaining the green belt fronting 24 Avenue N.W.
and transplanting five mature oak trees to the front of the Dr. Fok Ying Tung International House this fall.
A new site landscape plan is also being prepared, which involves planting replacement trees and creating additional recreational green space on the grounds of the new residence.
========,2,Student life.

Once run by the University of Calgary, the Den was taken over by the Students' Union in 2000.
========,3,The LDL.
The Last Defence Lounge (LDL) is run by the University of Calgary Graduate Students' Association.
It is a members-only club that is open to undergraduate and graduate students, as well as faculty, staff and members of the public.
========,3,Bermuda Shorts Day.
Bermuda Shorts Day (BSD) is an annual end-of-term tradition for the University of Calgary, usually celebrated around the close of winter semester every April.
As the name suggests, students traditionally wear Bermuda shorts.
Recent trends however have seen the rise of bright-neon and floral attire instead of the short formal trouser.
The event is notorious for turning the campus for one day only, into a giant festival of alcohol consumption and day-party concerts.
This cornerstone event of student life however had more modest origins.
In the summer of 1959, arts student Alan Arthur was ridiculed for wearing shorts in public, an apparent uncommon occurrence for men during the time.
In the following year, on Thursday, 31 March 1960, Arthur who was the inaugural "Associate-Editor" for the newly created student-run newspaper "the Gauntlet" at the time, took to the campus advertisement board and wrote in chalk, words of what would become the start of a campus tradition.
It is hotly contested what the original words were exactly, but one variant goes that Arthur wrote "Tomorrow is Bermuda Shorts Day.
Everyone wear Bermuda Shorts."
Arthur has stated that he wrote the now immortal words, in part to the arrival of warm spring weather, in jest as a light-hearted April Fools joke, and as an unlikely way to reduce stigma around men donning short-cut trousers.
The famed arts alumnus, Maurice Yacowar – who strangely enough, was The Gauntlet's inaugural "Editor-in-Chief" at the time – was a contemporary and personal friend of Arthur.
Yacowar recalls that many individuals of the UAC's 250 student population stayed true to Arthur's announcement, and wore Bermuda shorts that April Fools of 1960.
The first BSD, according to Arthur and Yacowar, was a more innocent affair, featuring a highly competitive marbles tournament.
Due to a controversial article entitled "Don't Wear a Poppy," Yacowar was abruptly fired from his position as Editor-in-chief just five months in, receiving a "56.4%" student-wide favourability rating against his dismissal.
He was then succeeded by his friend Arthur, becoming the second Gauntlet Editor-in-chief.
The pair would later graduate in 1962 to pursue lives in academia.
Arthur who received a degree in History would later become a – now retired – Professor of History from Brock University while Yacowar, who received a degree in English, would become Emeritus Professor of English and future Dean of Humanities here in the University of Calgary.
However, little did Arthur know just how powerful those 9 words would become, as the event gained increasing popularly for students to destress before exams.
The BSDs of later years would feature pie duels with the University President, musical gatherings in Administration, games of squamish, and a tricycle race between SU representatives.
In 1989, the University with the Student's Union introduced the BSD of modern day, with a single area which included the concert grounds and beer gardens.
========,3,Greek life.
Chi Gamma Chapter of Zeta Psi Fraternity was chartered at the University of Calgary in 1967 and has been contributing to campus life for over four decades, They have several hundred alumni that continue to support active chapter as well as The University of Calgary.
For over 40 years The Zete Haus, located at 2668 Capitol Hill Crescent N.W.
has provided economical student housing and is a focal point for fraternity activity.
The Omega Chi Chapter was formally initiated into the Alpha Kappa Psi Professional Business Fraternity on March 12, 2005, becoming the 302nd active branch and the 14th in the Northwest Region.
The Fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta, also known as Fiji, is the one of the two other fraternities present at the university.
It was at the university and is still running, being on campus since 1982.
The other current fraternity is Kappa Sigma, also known as K Sig.
Alpha Gamma Delta and Alpha Omicron Pi are the two existing sororities at the U of C, being established in 1983 and 1985 respectively.
Together, they form the Panhellenic Association of Calgary.
========,3,Leadership on campus.
In 2009, the University of Calgary's Office of the Student Experience (now the Student Success Centre) launched their own co-curricular record, the first of its kind in western Canadian universities.
The co-curricular record is an official university document that can be coupled with a student's academic transcript, that recognizes out-of-classroom experiences that are still connected to the university.
The Student Success Centre (SSC).
The SSC offers programs and services to support students in creating: (1) Academic Success, (2) Personal Success, and (3) Career Success.
