========,1,preface.
Margaret Moran Cho (born December 5, 1968) is an American stand-up comedian, actress, fashion designer, author, and singer-songwriter.
Cho is best known for her stand-up routines, through which she critiques social and political problems, especially regarding race and sexuality.
She has created music videos and has her own clothing line of crotchless underwear for men and women.
Cho has also frequently supported LGBT rights and has won awards for her humanitarian efforts on behalf of women, Asians, and the LGBT community.
As an actress, she has acted in such roles as Charlene Lee in "It's My Party" and John Travolta's FBI colleague in the action movie "Face/Off."
Cho was part of the cast of the TV series "Drop Dead Diva" on Lifetime Television, in which she appeared as Teri Lee, a paralegal assistant.
========,2,Early life.
Cho was born into a Korean family in San Francisco, California.
She grew up in a racially diverse neighborhood in the 1970s and 1980s, which she described as a community of "old hippies, ex-druggies, burn-outs from the 1960s, drag queens, Chinese people, and Koreans.
To say it was a melting pot — that's the least of it.
It was a really confusing, enlightening, wonderful time."
Cho's parents, Young-Hie and Seung-Hoon Cho, ran Paperback Traffic, a bookstore on Polk Street at California Street in San Francisco.
Her father writes joke books and a newspaper column in Seoul, South Korea.
As a child, Cho was bullied, saying that "I was hurt because I was different, and so sharing my experience of being beaten and hated and called ugly and fat and queer and foreign and perverse and gluttonous and lazy and filthy and dishonest and yet all the while remaining invisible heals me, and heals others when they hear it — those who are suffering right now."
Between the ages of five and twelve, Cho was "sexually molested by a family friend".
She often skipped class and got bad grades in ninth and tenth grades, resulting in her expulsion from Lowell High School.
Cho said she was "raped continuously through my teenage years" (by another acquaintance), and that when she told someone else about it and her classmates found out, she received hostile remarks justifying it, including accusations of being "so ugly and fat" that only a crazy person would have sex with her.
After Cho expressed an interest in performance, she auditioned and was accepted into the San Francisco School of the Arts, a San Francisco public high school for the arts.
While at the school, she became involved with the school's improvisational comedy group alongside actors Sam Rockwell and Aisha Tyler.
At age 15, she worked as a phone sex operator, and she later worked as a dominatrix.
========,2,Early career.
After doing several shows in a club adjacent to her parents's bookstore, Cho launched a stand-up career and spent several years developing her material in clubs.
Cho's career began to build after appearances on television and university campuses.
In 1992, she appeared on the unsuccessful "Golden Girls" spin-off "The Golden Palace" in a small role.
In 1994, Cho won the American Comedy Award for Best Female Comedian.
In 2010, on "The View", she discussed her nervousness about doing "The Golden Palace" and thanked the late Rue McClanahan for her help with rehearsing.
She also secured a coveted spot as opening act for Jerry Seinfeld; at this approximate time, she was featured on a Bob Hope special, and was also a frequent visitor to "The Arsenio Hall Show."
========,2,Television career.
========,3,"All American Girl".
That same year, ABC developed and aired a sitcom based on Cho's stand-up routine.
The show, titled "All-American Girl," was initially promoted as the first show prominently featuring an East Asian family, although the short lived sitcom "Mr. T and Tina," which had starred Noriyuki "Pat" Morita as Mr. T., preceded it by nearly two decades.
Cho has expressed subsequent regret for much of what transpired during the production of the show, specifically:

On August 10, 2007 the "San Francisco Chronicle" reviewed the show, Cho's work, key events in her personal life and characterized the show thus: "In fact, as bawdy and bad-behaving as the cast gets, the whole show feels more like a crazy family reunion than a performance."

[N]ot all women comedians are dangerous; some are just very funny: Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are too relatable, Joan Rivers was too firmly ensconced in the society that she mocked.
Amy Schumer relies a little too much on the word "pussy" to be any kind of threat, though she would like very much to be a bad person.
On the other hand, ... Margaret Cho know[s] no boundaries and inspire[s] palpable fear anytime [she] begin[s] one of [her] riffs.
