========,2,History.
Saline County was formed from Gallatin County in 1847.
It is named for the Saline River and the springs from which salt was produced in the early history of Gallatin County.
Saline County was almost named "Moredock County", in honor of John Moredock, who was known the "Indian slayer".
A militia officer and a member of the territorial legislature, Moredock had lost his mother and brother in an Indian attack when they were travelling from Pennsylvania to Illinois on the Ohio River in 1786.
Young Moredock had been travelling with another group, and he arrived on the scene to find his mother's body terribly mistreated.
He not only managed to tracked down and kill every member of the band that did it, but he spent much of his life ambushing and killing Native Americans, whether they were hostile or not.
Somewhat controversial because of this, he nevertheless was a popular figure in early Illinois.
He died in 1830.
The creation of Saline County was extremely controversial.
Illinois originally had a small number of very large counties.
As settlement proceeded, new counties were formed out of the original counties as a routine matter.
Gallatin County was an early county that was formed in 1812, and quickly split into around fifteen counties, with Gallatin County remaining with what is now Saline County.
This persisted for several decades after the era of rapid formation of counties.
Old Shawneetown was the original county seat of Gallatin County.
At that time Old Shawneetown was the largest city and commercial center of Illinois.
It was, however, located on the eastern edge of the County.
In 1826, the county seat was moved to the new village of Equality, near the center of what was then Gallatin County.
Old Shawneetown opposed this move, and sought redress by splitting off Saline County, with the aim of moving the County seat of what remained back to Old Shawneetown.
Thus the impetus for the formation of Saline County came not from settlers at the fringe of the county, but from the core of the original county.
Saline County was created by a voice vote in the General Assembly in 1847.
Completion of the formation of the county, however, involved three acts of the General Assembly, four decisions of the Illinois Supreme Court and two referendums.
The controversy came to involve the leading attorneys of Illinois, including Abraham Lincoln.
