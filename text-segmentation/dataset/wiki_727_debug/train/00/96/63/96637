========,1,preface.
A confidence trick (synonyms include confidence game, confidence scheme, ripoff, scam and stratagem) is an attempt to defraud a person or group after first gaining their confidence, used in the classical sense of trust.
Confidence tricks exploit characteristics of the human psyche, such as credulity, naïveté, compassion, vanity, irresponsibility, and greed.
========,2,Terminology.
The perpetrator of a confidence trick (or "con trick") is often referred to as a confidence (or "con") man, con-artist, or a "grifter".
Samuel Thompson (1821–1856) was the original "confidence man."
Thompson was a clumsy swindler who asked his victims to express confidence in him by giving him money or their watch rather than gaining their confidence in a more nuanced way.
A few people trusted Thompson with their money and watches.
Thompson was arrested in July 1849.
Reporting about this arrest, Dr. James Houston, a reporter of the "New York Herald", publicized Thompson by naming him the "Confidence Man".
Although Thompson was an unsuccessful scammer, he gained reputation as a genius operator mostly because Houston's satirical writing wasn't understood.
The National Police Gazette coined the term "confidence game" a few weeks after Houston first used the name, the "confidence man."
A confidence trick is also known as a con game, a con, a scam, a grift, a hustle, a bunko (or bunco), a swindle, a flimflam, a gaffle or a bamboozle.
The intended victims are known as "marks", "suckers", or "gulls" (i.e., gullible).
When accomplices are employed, they are known as shills.
========,3,Short and long cons.
A short con or small con is a fast swindle which takes just minutes.
It typically aims to rob the victim of everything in his or her wallet.
A long con or big con (also, chiefly ) is a scam that unfolds over several days or weeks and involves a team of swindlers, as well as props, sets, extras, costumes, and scripted lines.
It aims to rob the victim of huge sums of money or valuable things, often by getting him or her to empty out banking accounts and borrow from family members.
========,2,Stages of the con.
In "Confessions of a Confidence Man", Edward H. Smith lists the "six definite steps or stages of growth" of a confidence game.
He notes that some steps may be omitted.

In addition, some games require a "corroboration" step, particularly those involving a "rare item".
This usually includes the use of an accomplice who plays the part of an uninvolved (initially skeptical) third party, who later confirms the claims made by the con man.
========,2,Vulnerability to confidence tricks.
Confidence tricks exploit typical human characteristics such as greed, dishonesty, vanity, opportunism, lust, compassion, credulity, irresponsibility, desperation, and naïvety.
As such, there is no consistent profile of a confidence trick victim; the common factor is simply that the victim relies on the good faith of the con artist.
Victims of investment scams tend to show an incautious level of greed and gullibility, and many con artists target the elderly, but even alert and educated people may be taken in by other forms of a confidence trick.
Accomplices, also known as shills, help manipulate the mark into accepting the perpetrator's plan.
In a traditional confidence trick, the mark is led to believe that he will be able to win money or some other prize by doing some task.
The accomplices may pretend to be strangers who have benefited from performing the task in the past.
