This county is one of the most reliably Democratic counties in the state, as no Republican or independent candidate has won this county in any statewide election since 1992.
The only time a Democrat obtained less than 50% of the vote was in 1998, when Jesse Ventura of the Reform ticket won statewide; some 24% of the county voted for him.
Since 1992, the only time when a Republican obtained more than 34% of the vote was in the elections of 1994 (year of Republican Revolution) when the incumbent Independent-Republican governor won the statewide vote by a landslide of more than 60%, and when the Independent-Republican senatorial candidate won election with 49% statewide, both of which are rare occurrences in Minnesota.

In 2016, Donald Trump earned 39.7% of the county's vote, while the Democrat vote deteriorated to 51.4%; according to exit polls, this was due to residents' concerns about the decline of mining and forestry in the county.
