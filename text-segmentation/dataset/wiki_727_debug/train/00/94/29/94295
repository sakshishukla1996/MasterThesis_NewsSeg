Stanmore is a suburban residential district of northwest London in the London Borough of Harrow.

The population of the appropriate London Borough of Harrow Ward (Stanmore Park) was 11,229 at the 2011 Census.
========,2,Toponymy.
The area was recorded in the Domesday Book as "Stanmere", the name deriving from the Old English "stan", 'stony' and "mere", 'a pool'.
There are outcrops of gravel on the clay soil here and the "mere" may have been one of the ponds which still exist.
By 1574 the area had become known as Great Stanmore to distinguish it from Little Stanmore.

========,3,Parish Church.
The first Parish Church was the 14th century St Mary's, built on the site of a wooden Saxon church which itself may have been built on the site of a Roman compitum shrine.
It has now completely disappeared; one tomb survives in a back garden.
This building was replaced by a new one built in the current churchyard consecrated in 1632 and dedicated to St John the Evangelist.
Built of brick and consecrated by Archbishop Laud, it is one of the relatively small number of churches built in Britain between the medieval period and the eighteenth century.
By the nineteenth century, this church had become considered outdated and unsafe.
After its replacement, its roof was pulled off and it became a ruin.
A new church was constructed in the Gothic Revival style from 1849-50.
Queen Adelaide's last public appearance was to lay the foundation stone of the new church.
She gave the font and when the church was completed after her death, the east window was dedicated to her memory.
