Sumter County was created in 1853.

The county in the past, and to this day by some, is nicknamed "Hog County" most likely because it is home to a large population of wild hogs.
Hog hunting is still a favorite pastime of locals in the more rural portions of the county.
Although long extremely rural, in recent years Sumter County has sustained an exceptionally large increase in population, almost solely due to the expansion of The Villages retirement complex, a significant portion of which is in the county.
This has dramatically changed the demographics of the county and has brought in significant income.
