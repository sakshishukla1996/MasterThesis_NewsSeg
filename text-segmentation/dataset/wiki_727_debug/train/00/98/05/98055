Jelle Zijlstra (; 27 August 1918 â€“ 23 December 2001) was a Dutch politician of the now defunct Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP), which merged into the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) in 1977.
He served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 22 November 1966 until 5 April 1967.
An economist by occupation, he became a professor of Economics at the Vrije Universiteit at the age of thirty in 1948.
Zijlstra was asked to become Minister of Economic Affairs after the Dutch general election of 1952 in the second Drees cabinet under Prime Minister Willem Drees of the Labour Party, he resigned as a professor the same day he took office as the new Minister of Economic Affairs on 2 September 1952.
Zijlstra became the "lijsttrekker" (top candidate) of the Anti-Revolutionary Party for the Dutch general election of 1956 and served as party leader from 23 April 1956 to 3 October 1956, and as the parliamentary party leader of the Anti-Revolutionary Party in the House of Representatives from 14 June 1956 to 3 October 1956 and a Member of the House of Representatives from 3 July 1956 to 3 October 1956.
After a slow cabinet formation the third Drees cabinet was formed and Zijlstra remained Minister of Economic Affairs.
The Drees III cabinet fell on 22 December 1958 and a caretaker cabinet was formed by former Prime Minister Louis Beel of the Catholic People's Party.
Zijlstra remained as Minister of Economic Affairs and simultaneously served as Minister of Finance in the second Beel cabinet.
Zijlstra again became the "lijsttrekker" for the Anti-Revolutionary Party during the Dutch general election of 1959, and served as party leader of the Anti-Revolutionary Party a second time from 29 December 1958 until 26 May 1959.
After a quicker formation the new De Quay cabinet was formed on 19 May 1959.
Zijlstra remained Minister of Finance under the new Prime Minister Jan de Quay of the Catholic People's Party, and served until 14 July 1963, when the Marijnen cabinet was installed.
Zijlstra became a Member of the Senate on 25 June 1963 and returned to the Vrije Universiteit as an associate professor of Public finances.
On 14 October 1966, the Cals cabinet, the successor of the Marijnen cabinet, fell after the party leader of the Catholic People's Party Norbert Schmelzer introduced a motion of no confidence against the cabinet and Prime Minister Jo Cals, who was a member of his own party.
The Dutch political landscape was fractured and Zijlstra was asked to form a caretaker cabinet of which the primary task was to write out an early general election in 1967.
Zijlstra became Prime Minister of the Netherlands and Minister of General Affairs on 22 November 1966 and resigned as a Member of the Senate.
Zijlstra simultaneously served as Minister of Finance, leading the Zijlstra cabinet until 5 April 1967 when the De Jong cabinet was installed.
After his premiership, Zijlstra retired from active politics at the age of forty-eight and became the President of "De Nederlandsche Bank", the central bank of the Netherlands, serving from 1 May 1967 until 1 January 1982.
He had already been appointed as President of the bank on 16 September 1966, but his unexpected premiership delayed this.
Zijlstra also occupied numerous seats on supervisory boards in the business and industry world.
Zijlstra was widely respected for his expertise and integrity, and was a godparent of King Willem-Alexander.
On 30 April 1983 he was granted the honorary title of Minister of State, which he held until his death.
