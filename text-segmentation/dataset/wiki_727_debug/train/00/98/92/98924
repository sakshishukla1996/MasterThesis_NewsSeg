========,1,preface.
An antiphon (Greek ἀντίφωνον, ἀντί "opposite" and φωνή "voice") in Christian music and ritual is a responsory by a choir or congregation, usually in the form of a Gregorian chant, to a psalm or other text in a religious service or musical work.
Antiphony is now generally used for any call and response style of singing, such as the kirtan and the sea shanty.
Antiphonal music is music that is performed by two semi-independent choirs in interaction, often singing alternate musical phrases.
"Antiphonal psalmody" is the singing or musical playing of psalms by alternating groups of performers.
An antiphony is also a choir-book containing antiphons.
========,2,Origins.
The 'mirror' structure of Hebrew psalms renders it probable that the antiphonal method was present in the services of the ancient Israelites.
According to the historian Socrates of Constantinople, antiphony was introduced into Christian worship by Ignatius of Antioch (died 107), who saw a vision of two choirs of angels.
Antiphons have remained an integral part of the worship in the Byzantine and Armenian Rite.
The practice was not found in the Latin Church until more than two centuries later.
Ambrose and Gregory the Great, who are known for their contributions to the formulation of Gregorian chant, are credited with 'antiphonaries', collections of works suitable for antiphon, which are still used in the Roman Catholic Church today.
========,2,Polyphonic votive antiphons.
Polyphonic Marian antiphons emerged in England in the 14th century as settings of texts honouring the Virgin Mary separately from the mass and office, often after Compline.
Towards the end of the 15th century, English composers produced expanded settings up to nine parts, with increasing complexity and vocal range.
The largest collection of such antiphons is the late 15th century Eton Choirbook.
As a result, antiphony remains particularly common in the Anglican musical tradition: the singers often face each other, placed in the quire's "Decani" and "Cantoris".
========,2,Greater Advent antiphons.
The Greater Advent or O Antiphons are antiphons used at daily prayer in the evenings of the last days of Advent in various liturgical Christian traditions.
Each antiphon is a name of Christ, one of his attributes mentioned in Scripture.
In the Roman Catholic tradition, they are sung or recited at Vespers from December 17 to December 23.
In the Church of England they have traditionally been used as antiphons to the Magnificat at Evening Prayer.
More recently they have found a place in primary liturgical documents throughout the Anglican Communion, including the Church of England's "Common Worship" liturgy.
Use of the O Antiphons was preserved in Lutheranism at the German Reformation and continues to be used in Lutheran churches.
========,2,Polychoral antiphony.
When two or more groups of singers sing in alternation, the style of music can also be called "polychoral".
Specifically, this term is usually applied to music of the late Renaissance and early Baroque periods.
Polychoral techniques are a definitive characteristic of the music of the Venetian school, exemplified by the works of Giovanni Gabrieli: this music is often known as the Venetian polychoral style.
The Venetian polychoral style was an important innovation of the late Renaissance and this style, with its variations as it spread across Europe after 1600, helped to define the beginning of the Baroque era.
Polychoral music was not limited to Italy in the Renaissance.
It was popular in Spain and Germany and there are examples from the 19th and 20th centuries, from composers as diverse as Hector Berlioz, Igor Stravinsky, Bela Bartok, and Karlheinz Stockhausen.
