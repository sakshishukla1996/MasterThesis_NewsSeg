========,1,preface.
Route 19 is a state highway in Passaic County, New Jersey, United States.
Also referred to as the Paterson Peripheral, it runs from an intersection with County Route 509 (Broad Street) and County Route 609 (Colfax Avenue) in Clifton north to another intersection with County Route 509 (Main Street) in downtown Paterson.
Between U.S. Route 46 in Clifton and Interstate 80 in Paterson, Route 19 is a freeway.
The main purpose of the route is to connect the Garden State Parkway to I-80 and downtown Paterson.
The road was originally proposed as the Paterson spur of the Garden State Parkway that was to run north to Wayne.
In 1959, it was planned to become part of the Paterson Peripheral, an extension of Route 20 from downtown Paterson.
By 1971, the road was completed between the Garden State Parkway and I-80, at which time it received the Route 20 designation; the rest was cancelled in 1978 due to feared community disruption.
In 1988, this portion of Route 20 became Route 19 as it did not connect with the other segment of the route.
In the 1990s, Route 19 was extended to Main Street in downtown Paterson as part of a project that also completed the interchange with I-80.
