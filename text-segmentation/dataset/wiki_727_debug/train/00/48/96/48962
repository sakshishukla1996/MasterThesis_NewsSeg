========,1,preface.
Athens International Airport "Eleftherios Venizelos" (, "Diethnís Aeroliménas Athinón "Elefthérios Venizélos"") , commonly initialized as "AIA", began operation on 28 March 2001 and is the primary international airport that serves the city of Athens and the region of Attica.
It is Greece's busiest airport and it serves as the hub and main base of Aegean Airlines as well as other Greek airlines.
The airport is currently in Group 2 of Airports Council International (10–25 million) and as of 2016, Athens International is the 28th busiest airport in Europe.
========,2,History.
========,3,Development and ownership.
AIA is located between the towns of Markopoulo, Koropi, Spata and Loutsa, about to the east of central Athens ( by road, due to intervening hills).
The airport is named after Elefthérios Venizélos, the prominent Cretan political figure and Prime Minister of Greece, who made a significant contribution to the development of Greek aviation and the Hellenic Air Force in the 1930s.
As to-date, ownership is divided between the Hellenic Republic (Greek State) and Private Sector in a 55%-45% stake following a PPP scheme for the airport company.
Currently, private investors include the Copelouzos Group (5%) and PSP Investments of Canada (40%), following purchase of Hochtief's shares.
The airport was constructed to replace the now-closed Athens (Ellinikon) International Airport, as the latter had reached its saturation point with no physical space for further growth.
Studies for a new airport had been carried out from as early as the 1970s, with as many as 19 different locations being looked at before an area close to the town of Spata was chosen as suitable.
"Athens Airport SA", a state-owned company, was established in 1978 to proceed with the plans.
However, after delays and slow development, the project was revived in 1991 with the then government launching an international tender for the selection of a build-own-operate-transfer partner for the airport project, with Hochtief of Germany being selected.
In 1996, "Athens International Airport S.A." (AIA) was established as a Public–private partnership with a 30-year concession agreement.
That same year, the €2.1 billion development finally began with an estimated completion date of February 2001.
The airport construction was completed five months before schedule, but was delayed opening a month due to surface connections to Attiki Odos not being completed.
Its major features include two parallel runways being and long respectively.
The airport has received approval from the European Aviation Safety Agency and the Federal Aviation Administration for take-offs and landings of the biggest passenger jet worldwide, the A380.
The first ever A380 to visit 'Eleftherios Venizelos' Athens International Airport made an emergency landing on 13 April 2011 for emergency medical reasons.
The first scheduled A380 flight took place on 26 October 2012 by Emirates.
========,3,Greek government debt-crisis impact (2009–2013).
The Greek government-debt crisis reduced the overall passenger traffic of the airport for six consecutive years.
Many long-haul airlines outright terminated service to the airport, while others chose to operate on a seasonal basis only, opting to terminate service during the winter months.
Moreover, these problems were further exacerbated by the closure of Olympic Airlines, which operated many long-haul flights to and from the airport.
In 2013, the airport handled just above 12.5 million passengers, 3.2% fewer than in 2012 and lower by approximately 25% when compared to 2007, which was the all-time-high at that time.
========,3,Recovery and new levels of passenger traffic (2014–2015).
2014 signaled a strong recovery for the airport's passenger traffic and all statistical figures.
More than ten new airlines started new flights to and from Athens.
Aegean Airlines strengthened its network by 30% (with many more destinations scheduled for 2015) while Ryanair established a new base in the Athens Airport and added eight destinations.
The airport company recorded an increase in passenger traffic in excess of 21% during 2014, reaching 15.1 million passengers, resulted both by new destinations but also by increased capacity offered on established ones.
Characteristically, Singapore and Gulf Air resumed flights while Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways fly more frequently to/from Athens.
Delta Air Lines and American Airlines retained their seasonal schedules to/from USA with even more frequent connectivity.
From 2017 onwards, year-round services to Singapore are going to resume after more than 5 years.
Flights are going to be opeated by Scoot.
According to AIA published statistics, total traffic for 2015 achieved an impressive performance reaching almost 18.1 million passengers, an all-time-record for the airport, increased by 19% on year-over-year basis and by 1.55 million (+9.4%) the previous best, which was the pre-crisis year 2007.
In addition, over the same period, aircraft traffic exhibited a solid growth of 14% year-over-year.
Moreover, in 2015 a significant rise (+38%) was recorded by transfer passengers, with the international to international transfer traffic marking an impressive increase (+60%) demonstrating the significant enhancement of the Athens airport connectivity.
========,3,Exceeding twenty million passengers (2016).
Strong growth was evident throughout 2016, both for domestic and international destinations.
Annual results reflect a solid performance having an all-time record high been achieved for a second year in a row fueled by double-digit growth, this time passing the twenty million mark.
AIA showed passenger traffic in excess of 20 million passengers, increased by 10.7% on year-over-year basis.
Assuming current traffic levels will hold, it is feasible for the airport of Athens to achieve a total passenger traffic close to 22 million by the end of 2017.
Aircraft traffic also showed healthy growth reaching almost 190 thousand movements but remaining substantially less than total annual movements achieved in the 2007-2009 period.
========,2,Terminals.
========,3,Overview.
The airport currently has two terminals, the main terminal and the satellite terminal accessible by an underground link from the main terminal.
It is designed to be extended in a modular approach over the ensuing years in order to accommodate increases in air travel.
These extensions are planned in a six-phase framework.
The first (and current) phase allowed the airport to accommodate 26 million passengers per year.
When the airport originally opened, the current phase called for a capacity of only 16 million passengers per year; however, the capacity was able to increase without progressing to the next phase thanks to advanced IT logistics.
The sixth and final expansion phase will allow the airport to accommodate an annual traffic of 50 million passengers, with the current layout leaving enough space for five more terminals to be added.
As such, the parallel runway system currently in place has been designed to accommodate flight traffic with this high equivalent annual passenger load upon completion of the final expansion phase.
========,3,Main Terminal.
The main terminal building handles the all intra-Schengen flights, as well as several non-Schengen flights.
All of airport's 144 check-in desks are located in the Main Terminal and it has three separate levels, one for arrivals, one for departures and a food court level complete with a view of the eastern runway.
Finally, the terminal is equipped with fourteen jet bridges and eleven belt conveyors for luggage.
***LIST***.
========,3,Satellite Terminal.
The satellite terminal has two levels, one for arrivals and the other for departures.
It is also easily accessible through an underground link complete with moving walkways.
The terminal is equipped with ten jet bridges and is capable of handling annual traffic of six million passengers.
Due to the seasonality of traffic increases at the airport, it is only used when the traffic needs warrant it.
In recent years its parking stands were utilized for long term storage of airliners, specifically two ex-Olympic Airways Airbus A340-300s (both aircraft flew to new owner in February 2017) and a Boeing 767-300ER of defunct Greek start-up carrier SkyGreece Airlines.
However, as of June 2017, the parking space of the satellite terminal is in full use for Schengen area flights and to accommodate increased traffic.
Ryanair, Easyjet, Vueling and Eurowings are some of the airlines using the terminal.
========,2,Statistics.
Athens International Airport is the largest and busiest airport in Greece.
By the end of 2016, it was the 28th busiest airport in Europe handling a total traffic in excess of 20 million passengers.
========,2,Ground transport.
========,3,Railway and Metro.
A railway station is immediately adjacent to the airport terminal, accessible by an elevated walkway.
