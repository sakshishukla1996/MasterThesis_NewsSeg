========,2,History.
========,3,Establishment.
In October 1845, Joseph C. Avery arrived in Oregon from the east.
Avery took out a land claim at the mouth of Marys River where it flows into the Willamette River and in June 1846 took up residence there in a log cabin hastily constructed to hold what seemed a potentially lucrative claim.
Avery's primitive 1846 dwelling was the first home within the boundaries of today's Corvallis and his land claim included the southern section of the contemporary city.
Avery was quickly joined by other settlers along the banks of the Willamette River, including a 640-acre claim directly to his north taken in September 1846 by William F. Dixon.
The discovery of gold in California in 1848 temporarily stalled development of a township, with Avery leaving his Oregon claim to try his hand at mining in the fall of that year.
His stay would prove to be brief and in January 1849 Avery returned to Oregon with a small stock of provisions with a view to opening a store.
During the year 1849, Avery opened his store at the site, platted the land, and surveyed a town site on his land claim, naming the community Marysville.
It is possible that the city was named after early settler Mary Lloyd, but now the name is thought to be derived from French fur trappers' naming of Marys Peak after the Virgin Mary.
In the summer of 1851 Joseph Avery and William Dixon each granted back-to-back 40 acre land parcels from their land holdings for the establishment of a county seat.
Avery's holding lay to the south and Dixon's to the north, with the Benton Country Courthouse marking the approximate line of demarcation between these two land parcels.
========,3,Name change.
In December 1853 the 5th Oregon Territorial Legislature met in Salem, where a petition was presented seeking to change the name of that city to either "Thurston" or "Valena."
At the same time, another petition was presented seeking to change the name of Salem to "Corvallis," from the Latin meaning "heart of the valley," while a third resolution was presented to the upper house seeking the change the name of Marysville to Corvallis.
A heated debate followed, with the name ultimately awarded to Marysville in an act passed on December 20 of that same year.
By way of rationale, it was successfully argued that the name "Marysville" duplicated the moniker of a town in California located on the same stagecoach route and that a name change was thus necessary to avoid confusion.
========,3,Incorporation.
A faction within the deeply divided legislature sought to make Corvallis the capital of the Oregon Territory, and in December 1855 the 6th Territorial Legislature initially convened there before returning to Salem later that month — the town which would eventually be selected as the permanent seat of state government.
Corvallis was incorporated as a city on January 29, 1857.
========,3,19th century growth.
Nineteenth-century Corvallis saw a three-year boom beginning in 1889, which began with the establishment of a privately owned electrical plant by L.L.
A flurry of publicity and public and private investment followed, including construction of a grand county courthouse, planning and first construction of a new street railway, construction of a new flour mill along the river between Monroe and Jackson Avenues, and construction of the Hotel Corvallis, today known as the Julian Hotel.
In addition a carriage factory was launched in the city and the town's streets were improved, while the size of the city was twice enlarged through annexation.
Bonds were issued for a city-owned water works, a sewer system, and for public ownership of the electric plant.
A publicity campaign was launched to attempt to expand the tax base through new construction for new arrivals.
This effort proved mostly unsuccessful, however, and in 1892 normalcy returned, with the city saddled with about $150,000 in bonded debt.
========,2,Geography.
Corvallis is at an elevation of above sea level.
Situated midway in the Willamette Valley, Corvallis is about east of Newport and the Oregon Coast, south of Portland, south of the state capital, Salem, southwest of Albany, about west of Interstate 5 at its closest point, and north of Eugene/Springfield.
Oregon Route 99W, a secondary north–south route, also runs through Corvallis.
U.S. Route 20 (which leads to Newport) and Oregon Route 34 (which leads to Waldport about to the west) both secondary East-West routes run through Corvallis from the Oregon Coast.
Corvallis is at river mile 131–32 of the Willamette River.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.
========,2,Climate.
Like the rest of the Willamette Valley, Corvallis falls within the dry-summer subtropical climate zone, also referred to as cool-summer Mediterranean (Köppen "Csb").
Temperatures are mild year round, with warm, dry sunny summers and mild, wet winters with persistent overcast skies.
Spring and fall are also moist seasons with varied cloudiness, and light rain falling for extended periods.
Winter snow is rare, but occasionally does fall, and amounts can range between a dusting and a few inches that does not persist on the ground for more than a day.
The northwest hills will often experience more snow.
During the mid-winter months after extended periods of rain, thick persistent fogs can form, sometimes lasting the entire day.
This can severely reduce visibility to as low as .
The fog will often persist until a new storm system enters the area.
This fog could be seen as a type of tule fog.
Rainfall total within the town itself is surprisingly variable.
This is due to Corvallis lying right on the eastern edge of the Oregon Coast Range, with a small portion of the town inside of the range.
Rainfall amounts can range from an average of per year in the far northwest hills, compared to per year at Oregon State University which is located in the center of Corvallis.
Because of its close proximity to the coastal range, Corvallis can experience slightly cooler temperatures, particularly in the hills, than the rest of the Willamette Valley.
The average annual low temperature is 4 degrees less than that of Portland just to the north.
Despite this, temperatures dropping far below freezing are still a rare event.
========,2,Demographics.
Corvallis is the largest principal city of the Albany-Corvallis-Lebanon CSA, a Combined Statistical Area that includes the Corvallis metropolitan area (Benton County) and the Albany-Lebanon micropolitan area (Linn County), which had a combined population of 202,251 at the 2010 U.S. Census.

In 1903, Franz Edmund Creffield, commonly known as Edmund Creffield (c. 1870–1906), a German-American religious leader who called himself Joshua, founded a movement in Corvallis which became known locally as the "Holy Rollers".
Corvallis lies in the middle of the Unchurched Belt.
A 2003 study, released once every 10 years, listed Benton County (of which Corvallis makes up the majority of the population) as the least religious county per capita in the United States.
Only 1 in 4 people indicated that they were affiliated with one of the 149 religious groups the study identified.
The study indicated that some of the disparity, however, may be attributed to the popularity of less common religions (ones not included as an option in the study) in the Pacific Northwest.
========,2,Economy.
The campus of Oregon State University, which is the major local employer, is located near the edge of the main downtown area.
Other major employers include Samaritan Health Services, CH2M HILL, SIGA Technologies, Evanite Fiber, ONAMI, and HP Inc., which has a large printing research and development operation in the northeast area of town.
Because of this relative concentration of employment and the need for diversity, the city launched a website to attract creative industry to the region by branding it with the slogan "Yes Corvallis".
The National Clonal Germplasm Repository at Corvallis is a gene bank of the United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service.
The gene bank preserves temperate fruit, nut, and agronomic crops from around the world.
