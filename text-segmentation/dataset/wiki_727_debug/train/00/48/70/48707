========,1,preface.
GNU Octave is software featuring a high-level programming language, primarily intended for numerical computations.
Octave helps in solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with Matlab.
It may also be used as a batch-oriented language.
Since it is part of the GNU Project, it is free software under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
Octave is one of the major free alternatives to Matlab, others being FreeMat and Scilab.
Scilab, however, puts less emphasis on (bidirectional) syntactic compatibility with Matlab than Octave does.
========,2,History.
The project was conceived around 1988.
At first it was intended to be a companion to a chemical reactor design course.
Real development was started by John W. Eaton in 1992.
The first alpha release dates back to January 4, 1993 and on February 17, 1994 version 1.0 was released.
Version 4.0.0 was released on May 29, 2015.
The program is named after Octave Levenspiel, a former professor of the principal author.
Levenspiel is known for his ability to perform quick back-of-the-envelope calculations.
========,2,Developments.
In addition to use on desktops for personal scientific computing, Octave is used in academia and industry.
For example, Octave was used on a massive parallel computer at Pittsburgh supercomputing center to find vulnerabilities related to guessing social security numbers.
Dramatic Acceleration with OpenCL or CUDA is also possible with use of GPUs.
========,2,Octave, the language.
The Octave language is an interpreted programming language.
It is a structured programming language (similar to C) and supports many common C standard library functions, and also certain UNIX system calls and functions.
However, it does not support passing arguments by reference.
Octave programs consist of a list of function calls or a script.
The syntax is matrix-based and provides various functions for matrix operations.
It supports various data structures and allows object-oriented programming.
Its syntax is very similar to Matlab, and careful programming of a script will allow it to run on both Octave and Matlab.
Because Octave is made available under the GNU General Public License, it may be freely changed, copied and used.
The program runs on Microsoft Windows and most Unix and Unix-like operating systems, including macOS.
========,2,Notable features.
========,3,Command and variable name completion.
Typing a TAB character on the command line causes Octave to attempt to complete variable, function, and file names (similar to Bash's tab completion).
Octave uses the text before the cursor as the initial portion of the name to complete.
========,3,Data structures.
Octave includes a limited amount of support for organizing data in structures.
In this example, we see a structure "x" with elements "a", "b", and "c", (an integer, an array, and a string, respectively):
========,3,Variable-length argument lists.
Octave has a mechanism for handling functions that take an unspecified number of arguments without explicit upper limit.
To specify a list of zero or more arguments, use the special argument ***codice*** as the last (or only) argument in the list.
========,3,Variable-length return lists.
A function can be set up to return any number of values by using the special return value ***codice***.
For example:
========,3,C++ integration.
It is also possible to execute Octave code directly in a C++ program.
For example, here is a code snippet for calling ***codice***:
C and C++ code can be integrated into GNU Octave by creating oct files, or using the Matlab compatible MEX files.
========,2,Matlab compatibility.
Octave has been built with Matlab compatibility in mind, and shares many features with Matlab:
***LIST***.
Octave supposedly treats incompatibility with Matlab as a bug; therefore, it could be considered a software clone, which does not infringe software copyright as per "Lotus v. Borland" court case.
Matlab scripts from the MathWorks' FileExchange repository are compatible with Octave, but can't be used legally due the Terms of use.
While often provided and uploaded by users under an Octave compatible and proper Open source BSD license, the fileexchange's Terms of use prohibit any usage beside MathWorks proprietary Matlab.
========,3,Function compatibility.
Many of the numerous Matlab functions are available in GNU Octave, some of them are accessible through packages via Octave-forge, but not all Matlab functions are available in GNU Octave.
List of unavailable functions exists in Octave, and developers are seeking for help to implement them.
Looking for function __unimplemented.m__, leads to the list of unimplemented functions.
Unimplemented functions are also categorized in Image, Mapping, Optimization, Signal, and Statistics packages.
When an unimplemented function is called the following error message is shown:
========,2,User interfaces.
Octave comes with an official graphical user interface (GUI) and a integrated development environment (IDE) based on Qt.
It is available since Octave 3.8, and has become the default interface (over the command line interface) with the release of Octave 4.0.
Several 3rd-party graphical front-ends have been developed.
It was well received: "[Octave] now has a very workable GUI."
