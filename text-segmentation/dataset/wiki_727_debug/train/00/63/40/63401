In his first autobiography he described how he once considered ordination to the Anglican priesthood, but came to the conclusion that he "couldn't believe in God, because [he] was fundamentally Hellenic in [his] outlook."
He has stated that religion can have positive effects: "Sometimes belief means credulity, sometimes an expression of faith and hope which even the most sceptical atheist such as myself cannot but find inspiring."
In 2009, "The Guardian" published a letter from Fry addressing his younger self, explaining how his future is soon to unfold, reflecting on the positive progression towards gay acceptance and openness around him, and yet not everywhere, while warning on how "the cruel, hypocritical and loveless hand of religion and absolutism has fallen on the world once more."

Interviewed in 2015 by veteran Irish broadcaster Gay Byrne, Fry was asked what he would say if he came face-to-face with God.
Fry said: "Bone cancer in children, what’s that about?
How dare you?
How dare you create a world where there is such misery that’s not our fault?
It’s utterly, utterly evil.
Why should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid God who creates a world which is so full of injustice and pain?"
Within days, the video was viewed over five million times.
Fry later stated he did not refer to any specific religion, and said: "I said quite a few things that were angry at this supposed God.
I was merely saying things that Bertrand Russell and many finer heads of the mind have said for many thousands of years, going all the way back to the Greeks."
Because the God who created this universe, if it was created by God, is quite clearly a maniac, utter maniac.'
In May 2017 it was announced that Fry, along with broadcaster RTÉ, were under criminal investigation for blasphemy under the 2009 Defamation Act, following a complaint from a member of the public about the broadcast: the case was dropped after the police confirmed that they had not been able to locate a sufficient number of offended people.
