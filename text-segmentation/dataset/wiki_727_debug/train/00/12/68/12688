A shock site is a website that is intended to be offensive or disturbing to its viewers.
They contain material of high shock value, generally of a pornographic, scatological, graphically violent, insulting, obscenely vulgar, profane, or otherwise provocative nature.
Typically, the subject material of such sites deliberately degrades and debase a being or object.
Some shock sites display a single picture, animation, video clip or small gallery, and are circulated via email or disguised in posts to discussion sites as a prank.
Steven Jones distinguishes these sites from those that collect galleries of shocking content, such as Rotten.com, as the gallery sites must be searched for content.
Some shock sites have also gained their own subcultures and have become internet memes on their own.
Goatse.cx featured a page devoted to fan-submitted artwork and tributes to the site's hello.jpg, and a parody of the image was unwittingly shown by a BBC newscast as an alternative for for the 2012 Summer Olympics.
A 2007 shock video known as "2 Girls 1 Cup" also quickly became an Internet phenomenon, with videos of reactions, homages, and parodies widely posted on video sharing sites such as YouTube.
