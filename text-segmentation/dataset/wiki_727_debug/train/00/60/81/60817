========,1,preface.

The third most populous city in the country, with 319,279 inhabitants as of the 2011 census, Timișoara is the informal capital city of the historical region of Banat.
In September 2016, Timișoara was selected as the European Capital of Culture for 2021.
========,2,History.
========,3,Middle Ages.
Timișoara was first mentioned as a place in either 1212 or 1266 as Castrum Temesiense.
The territory later to be known as Banat was conquered and annexed by the Kingdom of Hungary in 1030.
Timișoara grew considerably during the reign of Charles I, who, upon his visit here in 1307, ordered the construction of a royal palace.
Timișoara's importance also grew due to its strategic location, which facilitated control over the Banat plain.
By the middle of the 14th century, Timișoara was at the forefront of Western Christendom's battle against the Muslim Ottoman Turks.
French and Hungarian crusaders met at the city before engaging in the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396.
Beginning in 1443, John Hunyadi used Timișoara as a military stronghold against the Turks, having built a powerful fortress.
The city was repeatedly besieged by the Ottomans in 1462, 1476, 1491, and 1522.
========,3,16th–19th centuries.
In 1552, a 16,000-strong Ottoman army led by Kara Ahmed Pasha conquered the city and transformed it into a capital city in the region (Temeşvar Eyalet).
The local military commander, István Losonczy, and other Christians were massacred on 27 July 1552 while escaping the city through the Azapilor Gate.
Timișoara remained under Ottoman rule for nearly 160 years, controlled directly by the Sultan and enjoying a special status, similar to other cities in the region such as Budapest and Belgrade.
During this period, Timișoara was home to a large Islamic community and produced famous historical figures such as Osman Aga of Temesvar, until Prince Eugene of Savoy conquered it in 1716.
Subsequently, the city came under Habsburg rule, and it remained so until the early 20th century, except for the Ottoman occupation between 1788–1789 during the Ottoman-Habsburg war.
During this time, Timișoara evolved from a strategic fortress to an economic and industrial centre: numerous factories were built, electric illumination and public transport were introduced, and rail connections were established.
The city was defortified starting in 1892 up until 1910, and several major road arteries were built to connect the suburbs with the city centre, paving the way for further expansion of the city.
It was the first mainland European city and second in the world after New York to be lit by electric street lamps in 1884.
It was also the second European and the first city in what is now Romania with horse-drawn trams in 1869.
It is said that Gustave Eiffel, the creator of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, drew the projects of one of Timișoara's footbridges over the Bega, the "Metal Bridge", however, it was actually planned by Róbert Tóth, the head of the Bridge Department, at the Reșița rail factory.
========,3,20th century.
On 31 October 1918, local military and political elites establish the "Banat National Council", together with representatives of the region's main ethnic groups: Romanians, Germans, Serbs and Hungarians.
On 1 November they proclaimed in Timișoara the short-lived Banat Republic.
In the aftermath of World War I, the Banat region was divided between the Kingdom of Romania and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and Timișoara came under Romanian administration after Serbian occupation between 1918–1919.
The city was ceded from Hungary to Romania by the Treaty of Trianon on 4 June 1920.
In 1920, King Ferdinand I awarded Timișoara the status of a University Centre, and the interwar years saw continuous economic and cultural development.
A number of anti-fascist and anti-revisionist demonstrations also took place during this time.
During World War II, Timișoara suffered damage from both Allied and Axis bombing raids, especially during the second half of 1944.
On 23 August 1944, Romania, which until then was a member of the Axis, declared war on Nazi Germany and joined the Allies.
Surprised, the local Wehrmacht garrison surrendered without a fight, and German and Hungarian troops attempted to take the city by force throughout September, without success.
After the war, the People's Republic of Romania was proclaimed, and Timișoara underwent Sovietization and later, systematisation.
The city's population tripled between 1948 and 1992.
In December 1989, Timișoara witnessed a series of mass street protests in what was to become the Romanian Revolution.
On 20 December, three days after bloodshed began there, Timișoara was declared the first city free of Communism in Romania.
========,2,Geography.
Timișoara lies at an altitude of on the southeast edge of the Banat plain, part of the Pannonian Plain near the divergence of the Timiș and Bega rivers.
The waters of the two rivers form a swampy and frequently flooded land.
Timișoara developed on one of few places where the swamps could be crossed.
These constituted a natural protection around the fortress for a very long time, however, they also favoured a wet and insalubrious climate, as well as the proliferation of the plague and cholera, which kept the number of inhabitants at a relatively low number and significantly prevented the development of the city.
With time, however, the rivers of the area were drained, dammed and diverted.
Due to these hydrographical projects undertaken in the 18th century, the city no longer lies on the Timiș River, but on the Bega canal.
This improvement of the land was made irreversible by building the Bega canal (started in 1728) and by the complete draining of the surrounding marshes.
However, the land across the city lies above a water table at a depth of only , a factor which does not allow the construction of tall buildings.
The rich black soil and relatively high water table make this a fertile agricultural region.
This is a relatively active seismic area, and earthquakes up to 6 on the Richter scale have been recorded.
========,3,Climate.
Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round.
The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is "" (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).

In spite of all that, the Banat climate is also influenced by the presence of cyclones and warm air masses which come from the Adriatic Sea and the Mediterranean.
Their characteristic feature is that of complete snow thaw during the winter period and stifling heat during the summer period.
Freak measurable snowfalls have occurred as early as late October and as late as early April, but snow in those months is rare, and significant falls do not usually occur until late November.
