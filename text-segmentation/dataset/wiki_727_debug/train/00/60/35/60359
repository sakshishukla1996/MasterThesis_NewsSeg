========,1,preface.
Benthos is the community of organisms that live on, in, or near the seabed, also known as the benthic zone.
This community lives in or near marine sedimentary environments, from tidal pools along the foreshore, out to the continental shelf, and then down to the abyssal depths.
Many organisms adapted to deep-water pressure cannot survive in the upper parts of the water column.
The pressure difference can be very significant (approximately one atmosphere for each 10 metres of water depth).
Because light is absorbed before it can reach deep ocean-water, the energy source for deep benthic ecosystems is often organic matter from higher up in the water column that drifts down to the depths.
This dead and decaying matter sustains the benthic food chain; most organisms in the benthic zone are scavengers or detritivores.
The term "benthos", coined by Haeckel in 1891, comes from the Greek noun "depth of the sea".
"Benthos" is also used in freshwater biology to refer to organisms at the bottom of freshwater bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, and streams.
There is also a redundant synonym, "benthon".
========,2,Food sources.
The main food sources for the benthos are algae and organic runoff from land.
The depth of water, temperature and salinity, and type of local substrate all affect what benthos is present.
In coastal waters and other places where light reaches the bottom, benthic photosynthesizing diatoms can proliferate.
Filter feeders, such as sponges and bivalves, dominate hard, sandy bottoms.
Deposit feeders, such as polychaetes, populate softer bottoms.
Fish, such as dragonets, as well as sea stars, snails, cephalopods, and crustaceans are important predators and scavengers.
Benthic organisms, such as sea stars, oysters, clams, sea cucumbers, brittle stars and sea anemones, play an important role as a food source for fish, such as the California sheephead, and humans.

========,3,Macrobenthos.
They are easily visible to the naked eye with the lower range of body size at 0.5 mm but usually larger than 3 mm.
In the coastal water ecosystem, they include several species of organisms from different taxa including Porifera, Annelids, Coelenterates, Mollusks, Crustaceans, Arthropods etc.
