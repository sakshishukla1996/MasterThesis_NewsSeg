========,1,preface.
Sufism or Taṣawwuf (), which is often defined as "Islamic mysticism," "the inward dimension of Islam," or "the phenomenon of mysticism within Islam," is a mystical trend in Islam "characterized ... [by particular] values, ritual practices, doctrines and institutions" which began very early on in Islamic history and which represents "the main manifestation and the most important and central crystallization of" mystical practice in Islam.
Although the overwhelming majority of Sufis, both pre-modern and modern, have been adherents of Sunni Islam, there nevertheless also developed certain strands of Sufi practice within the ambit of Shiism during the late medieval period.
Practitioners of Sufism have been referred to as "Sufis" (; ), an Arabic word which is believed by historians to have originally indicated the "woollen clothes ("ṣūf") or rough garb" worn by the early Islamic mystics.
Historically, they have often belonged to different "ṭuruq" or "orders"—congregations formed around a grand master referred to as a "mawla" who traces a direct chain of teachers back to the Islamic prophet, Muhammad.
These orders meet for spiritual sessions ("majalis") in meeting places known as "zawiyas", "khanqahs", or "tekke".
They strive for "ihsan" (perfection of worship) as detailed in a hadith: "Ihsan is to worship Allah as if you see Him; if you can't see Him, surely He sees you."
Rumi stated: "The Sufi is hanging on to Muhammad, like Abu Bakr."
Sufis regard Muhammad as "al-Insān al-Kāmil", the primary perfect man who exemplifies the morality of God, and regard Muhammad as their leader and prime spiritual guide.
All Sufi orders trace many of their original precepts from Muhammad through his son-in-law Ali with the notable exception of the Naqshbandi, who claim to trace their origins from Muhammad through the first Rashid Caliph, Abu Bakr.
The orders largely follow one of the four madhhabs (jurisprudent schools of thought) of Sunni Islam and maintain a Sunni aqidah (creed).
Classical Sufis were characterized by their asceticism, especially by their attachment to dhikr, the practice of repeating the names of God, often performed after prayers.
They gained adherents among a number of Muslims as a reaction against the worldliness of the early Umayyad Caliphate (661–750).
and have spanned several continents and cultures over a millennium, originally expressing their beliefs in Arabic before spreading into Persian, Turkish, and Urdu among dozens of other languages.
According to William Chittick, "In a broad sense, Sufism can be described as the interiorization, and intensification of Islamic faith and practice."
========,2,Terminology.
The term "Sufism" came into being, not by Islamic texts or Sufis themselves but by British Orientalists who wanted to create an artificial divide between what they found attractive in Islamic civilization (i.e.
Islamic spirituality) and the negative stereotypes that were present in Britain about Islam.
These British orientalists, therefore, fabricated a divide that was previously non-existent.
The term "Sufism" has, however, persisted especially in the Western world ever since.
Historically, Muslims have used the Arabic word "taṣawwuf" to identify the practice of Sufis.
Mainstream scholars of Islam define Tasawwuf or Sufism as the name for the inner or esoteric dimension of Islam which is supported and complemented by outward or exoteric practices of Islam, such as Sharia.
In this view, "it is absolutely necessary to be a Muslim" to be a true Sufi, because Sufism's "methods are inoperative without" Muslim "affiliation".
However, Islamic scholars themselves are not by any means in agreement about the meaning of the word "sufi".
Sufis themselves claim that Tasawwuf is an aspect of Islam similar to Sharia, inseparable from Islam and an integral part of Islamic belief and practice.
Classical Sufi scholars have defined Tasawwuf as "a science whose objective is the reparation of the heart and turning it away from all else but God".
Traditional Sufis such as Bayazid Bastami, Rumi, Haji Bektash Veli, Junayd of Baghdad, and Al-Ghazali, define Sufism as purely based upon the tenets of Islam and the teachings of Muhammad.
========,2,Etymology.
The original meaning of "sufi" seems to have been "one who wears wool (')", and Encyclopedia of Islam calls other etymological hypotheses "untenable".
Woollen clothes were traditionally associated with ascetics and mystics.
Al-Qushayri and Ibn Khaldun both rejected all possibilities other than ' on linguistic grounds.
Another explanation traces the lexical root of the word to "" "()", which in Arabic means "purity".
These two explanations were combined by the Sufi al-Rudhabari (d. 322 AH), who said, "The Sufi is the one who wears wool on top of purity".
Others have suggested that the word comes from the term "" ("the people of the bench"), who were a group of impoverished companions of Muhammad who held regular gatherings of dhikr.
These men and women who sat at al-Masjid an-Nabawi are considered by some to be the first Sufis.
========,2,History.
========,3,Origins.
Sufi orders are based on the "bayah" (pledge of allegiance) that was given to Muhammad by his Sahaba.
By pledging allegiance to Muhammad, the Sahaba had committed themselves to the service of God.
According to Islamic belief, by pledging allegiance to Muhammad, the Sahaba have pledged allegiance to God.
Sufis believe that by giving bayah (pledging allegiance) to a legitimate Sufi shaykh, one is pledging allegiance to Muhammad and therefore a spiritual connection between the seeker and Muhammad is established.
It is through Muhammad that Sufis aim to learn about, understand and connect with God.
Ali is regarded as one of the major figures amongst the Sahaba who have directly pledged allegiance to Muhammad and Sufis maintain that through Ali, knowledge about Muhammad and a connection with Muhammad may be attained.
Such a concept may be understood by the hadith, which Sufis regard to be authentic, in which Muhammad said, "I am the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate".
Eminent Sufis such as Ali Hujwiri refer to Ali as having a very high ranking in Tasawwuf.
Furthermore, Junayd of Baghdad regarded Ali as sheikh of the principals and practices of Tasawwuf.
Practitioners of Sufism hold that in its early stages of development Sufism effectively referred to nothing more than the internalization of Islam.
According to one perspective, it is directly from the Qur'an, constantly recited, meditated, and experienced, that Sufism proceeded, in its origin and its development.
Other practitioners have held that Sufism is the strict emulation of the way of Muhammad, through which the heart's connection to the Divine is strengthened.
Modern academics and scholars have rejected early orientalist theories asserting a non-Islamic origin of Sufism, The consensus is that it emerged in Western Asia.
Many have asserted Sufism to be unique within the confines of the Islamic religion and contend that Sufism developed from people like Bayazid Bastami, who, in his utmost reverence to the sunnah, refused to eat a watermelon because he did not find any proof that Muhammad ever ate it.
According to the late medieval mystic Jami, Abd-Allah ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah (died c. 716) was the first person to be called a "Sufi".
Important contributions in writing are attributed to Uwais al-Qarani, Hasan of Basra, Harith al-Muhasibi and Said ibn al-Musayyib.
Ruwaym, from the second generation of Sufis in Baghdad, was also an influential early figure, as was Junayd of Baghdad; a number of early practitioners of Sufism were disciples of one of the two.
Sufism had a long history already before the subsequent institutionalization of Sufi teachings into devotional orders ("tarîqât") in the early Middle Ages.
The Naqshbandi order is a notable exception to general rule of orders tracing their spiritual lineage through Muhammad's grandsons, as it traces the origin of its teachings from Muhammad to the first Islamic Caliph, Abu Bakr.
Over the years Sufi orders have influenced and have been adopted by various Shi'i movements, especially Isma'ilism, which led to the Safaviyya order's conversion to Shia Islam from Sunni Islam and the spread of Twelverism throughout Iran.
Sufi orders include Ba 'Alawiyya, Badawiyya, Bektashi, Burhaniyya, Chishti, Khalwati, Mevlevi, Naqshbandi, Ni'matullāhī, Uwaisi, Qadiriyya, Qalandariyya, Rifa'i, Sarwari Qadiri, Shadhiliyya, Suhrawardiyya, Tijaniyyah, Zinda Shah Madariya, and others.
========,3,As an Islamic discipline.
Existing in both Sunni and Shia Islam, Sufism is not a distinct sect, as is sometimes erroneously assumed, but a method of approaching or a way of understanding the religion, which strives to take the regular practice of the religion to the "supererogatory level" through simultaneously "fulfilling ... [the obligatory] religious duties" and finding a "way and a means of striking a root through the 'narrow gate' in the depth of the soul out into the domain of the pure arid unimprisonable Spirit which itself opens out on to the Divinity."
As a mystical-ascetic aspect of Islam, it is considered as the part of Islamic teaching that deals with the purification of the inner self.
By focusing on the more spiritual aspects of religion, Sufis strive to obtain direct experience of God by making use of "intuitive and emotional faculties" that one must be trained to use.
Tasawwuf is regarded as a science of the soul that has always been an integral part of Orthodox Islam.
In his Al-Risala al-safadiyya, Ibn Taymiyya describes the Sufis as those who belong to the path of the Sunna and represent it in their teachings and writings.
Ibn Taymiyya's Sufi inclinations and his reverence for Sufis like 'Abd al-Qadir Gilani can also be seen in his hundred-page commentary on "Futuh al-ghayb", covering only five of the seventy-eight sermons of the book, but showing that he considered tasawwuf essential within the life of the Islamic community.
In his commentary, Ibn Taymiyya stresses that the primacy of the Shari`a forms the soundest tradition in tasawwuf, and to argue this point he lists over a dozen early masters, as well as more contemporary shaykhs like his fellow Hanbalis, al-Ansari al-Harawi and `Abd al-Qadir, and the latter's own shaykh, Hammad al-Dabbas the upright.
He cites the early shaykhs (shuyukh al-salaf) such as Fudayl ibn `Iyad, Ibrahim ibn Adham, Ma`ruf al-Karkhi, al-Sari al-Saqati, al-Junayd ibn Muhammad, and others of the early teachers, as well as Shaykh Abd al-Qadir, Shaykh Hammad, Shaykh Abu al-Bayan and others of the later masters— that they do not permit the followers of the Sufi path to depart from the divinely legislated command and prohibition.
Imam Ghazali narrates in Al-Munqidh min-al-dalal:
The vicissitudes of life, family affairs and financial constraints engulfed my life and deprived me of the congenial solitude.
The heavy odds confronted me and provided me with few moments for my pursuits.
This state of affairs lasted for ten years but wherever I had some spare and congenial moments I resorted to my intrinsic proclivity.
During these turbulent years, numerous astonishing and indescribable secrets of life were unveiled to me.
I was convinced that the group of Aulia (holy mystics) is the only truthful group who follow the right path, display best conduct and surpass all sages in their wisdom and insight.
They derive all their overt or covert behaviour from the illumining guidance of the holy Prophet, the only guidance worth quest and pursuit.
========,3,Formalization of doctrine.
In the eleventh-century, Sufism, which had previously been a less "codified" trend in Islamic piety, began to be "ordered and crystallized" into orders which have continued until the present day.
All these orders were founded by a major Islamic saint, and some of the largest and most widespread included the Qadiriyya (after Abdul-Qadir Gilani [d. 1166]), the Rifa'iyya (after Ahmed al-Rifa'i [d. 1182]), the Chishtiyya (after Moinuddin Chishti [d. 1236]), the Shadiliyya (after Abul Hasan ash-Shadhili [d. 1258]), and the Naqshbandiyya (after Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari [d. 1389]).
Contrary to popular perception in the West, however, neither the founders of these orders nor their followers ever considered themselves to be anything other than orthodox Sunni Muslims, and in fact all of these orders were attached to one of the four orthodox legal schools of Sunni Islam.
Thus, the Qadiriyya order was Hanbali, with its founder, Abdul-Qadir Gilani, being a renowned Hanbali jurist; the Chishtiyya was Hanafi; the Shadiliyya order was Maliki; and the Naqshbandiyya order was Hanafi.
Thus, it is precisely because it is historically proven that "many of the most eminent defenders of Islamic orthodoxy, such as Abdul-Qadir Gilani, Ghazali, and the Sultan Ṣalāḥ ad-Dīn (Saladin) were connected with Sufism" that the popular studies of writers like Idris Shah are continuously disregarded by scholars as conveying the fallacious image that "Sufism" is somehow distinct from "Islam."
Towards the end of the first millennium, a number of manuals began to be written summarizing the doctrines of Sufism and describing some typical Sufi practices.
Two of the most famous of these are now available in English translation: the "Kashf al-Mahjûb" of Ali Hujwiri and the "Risâla" of Al-Qushayri.
Two of al-Ghazali's greatest treatises are the "Revival of Religious Sciences" and what he termed "its essence", the "Kimiya-yi sa'ādat".
He argued that Sufism originated from the Qur'an and thus was compatible with mainstream Islamic thought and did not in any way contradict Islamic Law—being instead necessary to its complete fulfillment.
Ongoing efforts by both traditionally trained Muslim scholars and Western academics are making al-Ghazali's works more widely available in English translation, allowing English-speaking readers to judge for themselves the compatibility of Islamic Law and Sufi doctrine.
Several sections of the "Revival of Religious Sciences" have been published in translation by the Islamic Texts Society.
An abridged translation (from an Urdu translation) of "The Alchemy of Happiness" was published by Claud Field () in 1910.
It has been translated in full by Muhammad Asim Bilal (2001).
========,3,Growth of influence.
Historically, Sufism became "an incredibly important part of Islam" and "one of the most widespread and omnipresent aspects of Muslim life" in Islamic civilization from the early medieval period onwards, when it began to permeate nearly all major aspects of Sunni Islamic life in regions stretching from India and Iraq to the Balkans and Senegal.
The rise of Islamic civilization coincides strongly with the spread of Sufi philosophy in Islam.
The spread of Sufism has been considered a definitive factor in the spread of Islam, and in the creation of integrally Islamic cultures, especially in Africa and Asia.
The Senussi tribes of Libya and the Sudan are one of the strongest adherents of Sufism.
Sufi poets and philosophers such as Khoja Akhmet Yassawi, Rumi, and Attar of Nishapur (c. 1145 – c. 1221) greatly enhanced the spread of Islamic culture in Anatolia, Central Asia, and South Asia.
Sufism also played a role in creating and propagating the culture of the Ottoman world, and in resisting European imperialism in North Africa and South Asia.
Between the 13th and 16th centuries, Sufism produced a flourishing intellectual culture throughout the Islamic world, a "Golden Age" whose physical artifacts survive.
In many places a person or group would endow a waqf to maintain a lodge (known variously as a "zawiya", "khanqah", or "tekke") to provide a gathering place for Sufi adepts, as well as lodging for itinerant seekers of knowledge.
The same system of endowments could also pay for a complex of buildings, such as that surrounding the Süleymaniye Mosque in Istanbul, including a lodge for Sufi seekers, a hospice with kitchens where these seekers could serve the poor and/or complete a period of initiation, a library, and other structures.
No important domain in the civilization of Islam remained unaffected by Sufism in this period.
========,3,Present.
Sufism continued to remain a crucial part of daily Islamic life until the twentieth century, when its historical influence upon Islamic civilization began to be undermined by modernism as well as be combated by the rise of Salafism and Wahhabism.
Islamic scholar Timothy Winter has remarked: "[In] classical, mainstream, medieval Sunni Islam ... [the idea of] 'orthodox Islam' would not ... [have been possible] without Sufism," and that the classical belief in Sufism being an essential component of Islam has only weakened in some quarters of the Islamic world "a generation or two ago" with the rise of Salafism.
In the modern world, the classical interpretation of Sunni orthodoxy, which sees in Sufism an essential dimension of Islam alongside the disciplines of jurisprudence and theology, is represented by institutions such as Egypt's Al-Azhar University and Zaytuna College, with Al-Azhar's current Grand Imam Ahmed el-Tayeb recently defining "Sunni orthodoxy" as being a follower "of any of the four schools of [legal] thought (Hanafi, Shafi’i, Maliki or Hanbali) and ... [also] of the Sufism of Imam Junayd of Baghdad in doctrines, manners and [spiritual] purification."
Current Sufi orders include Alians, Bektashi Order, Mevlevi Order, Ba 'Alawiyya, Chishti Order, Jerrahi, Naqshbandi, Mujaddidi, Ni'matullāhī, Qadiriyya, Qalandariyya, Sarwari Qadiriyya, Shadhiliyya, Suhrawardiyya, Ashrafi Family, Saifiah (Naqshbandiah), and Uwaisi.
The relationship of Sufi orders to modern societies is usually defined by their relationship to governments.
Turkey and Persia together have been a center for many Sufi lineages and orders.
The Bektashi were closely affiliated with the Ottoman Janissaries and is the heart of Turkey's large and mostly liberal Alevi population.
It has spread westwards to Cyprus, Greece, Albania, Bulgaria, Republic of Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, and, more recently, to the United States via Albania.
Sufism is popular in such African countries as Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Senegal, where it is seen as a mystical expression of Islam.
Sufism is traditional in Morocco but has seen a growing revival with the renewal of Sufism under contemporary spiritual teachers such as Hamza al Qadiri al Boutchichi.
Mbacke suggests that one reason Sufism has taken hold in Senegal is because it can accommodate local beliefs and customs, which tend toward the mystical.
The life of the Algerian Sufi master Abdelkader El Djezairi is instructive in this regard.
Notable as well are the lives of Amadou Bamba and El Hadj Umar Tall in West Africa, and Sheikh Mansur and Imam Shamil in the Caucasus.
In the twentieth century, some Muslims have called Sufism a superstitious religion that holds back Islamic achievement in the fields of science and technology.
A number of Westerners have embarked with varying degrees of success on the path of Sufism.
One of the first to return to Europe as an official representative of a Sufi order, and with the specific purpose to spread Sufism in Western Europe, was the Swedish-born wandering Sufi Ivan Aguéli.
René Guénon, the French scholar, became a Sufi in the early twentieth century and was known as Sheikh Abdul Wahid Yahya.
His manifold writings defined the practice of Sufism as the essence of Islam but also pointed to the universality of its message.
Other spiritualists, such as George Gurdjieff, may or may not conform to the tenets of Sufism as understood by orthodox Muslims.
Other noteworthy Sufi teachers who have been active in the West in recent years include Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, Inayat Khan, Nazim Al-Haqqani, Javad Nurbakhsh, Bulent Rauf, Irina Tweedie, Idries Shah, Muzaffer Ozak, Nahid Angha, and Ali Kianfar.
Currently active Sufi academics and publishers include Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee, Nuh Ha Mim Keller, Abdullah Nooruddeen Durkee, Waheed Ashraf, Omer Tarin, Ahmed abdu r Rashid and Timothy Winter.
========,2,Aims and objectives.
While all Muslims believe that they are on the pathway to Allah and hope to become close to God in Paradise—after death and after the Last Judgment—Sufis also believe that it is possible to draw closer to God and to more fully embrace the divine presence in this life.
The chief aim of all Sufis is to seek the pleasing of God by working to restore within themselves the primordial state of "fitra", described in the Quran.
In this state nothing one does defies God, and all is undertaken with the single motivation of "ishq".
To Sufis, the outer law consists of rules pertaining to worship, transactions, marriage, judicial rulings, and criminal law—what is often referred to, broadly, as "qanun".
The inner law of Sufism consists of rules about repentance from sin, the purging of contemptible qualities and evil traits of character, and adornment with virtues and good character.
========,3,Teachings.
To the Sufi, it is the transmission of divine light from the teacher's heart to the heart of the student, rather than worldly knowledge, that allows the adept to progress.
They further believe that the teacher should attempt inerrantly to follow the Divine Law.
According to Moojan Momen "one of the most important doctrines of Sufism is the concept of "al-Insan al-Kamil" "the Perfect Man".
This doctrine states that there will always exist upon the earth a "Qutb" (Pole or Axis of the Universe)—a man who is the perfect channel of grace from God to man and in a state of wilayah (sanctity, being under the protection of Allah).
The concept of the Sufi Qutb is similar to that of the Shi'i Imam.
However, this belief puts Sufism in "direct conflict" with Shia Islam, since both the Qutb (who for most Sufi orders is the head of the order) and the Imam fulfill the role of "the purveyor of spiritual guidance and of Allah's grace to mankind".
The vow of obedience to the Shaykh or Qutb which is taken by Sufis is considered incompatible with devotion to the Imam".
As a further example, the prospective adherent of the Mevlevi Order would have been ordered to serve in the kitchens of a hospice for the poor for 1001 days prior to being accepted for spiritual instruction, and a further 1,001 days in solitary retreat as a precondition of completing that instruction.
Some teachers, especially when addressing more general audiences, or mixed groups of Muslims and non-Muslims, make extensive use of parable, allegory, and metaphor.
Although approaches to teaching vary among different Sufi orders, Sufism as a whole is primarily concerned with direct personal experience, and as such has sometimes been compared to other, non-Islamic forms of mysticism (e.g., as in the books of Hossein Nasr).
Many Sufi believe that to reach the highest levels of success in Sufism typically requires that the disciple live with and serve the teacher for a long period of time.
An example is the folk story about Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari, who gave his name to the Naqshbandi Order.
He is believed to have served his first teacher, Sayyid Muhammad Baba As-Samasi, for 20 years, until as-Samasi died.
He is said to then have served several other teachers for lengthy periods of time.
He is said to have helped the poorer members of the community for many years and after this concluded his teacher directed him to care for animals cleaning their wounds, and assisting them.
========,3,Muhammad.
Devotion to Muhammad is an exceptionally strong practice within Sufism.
Sufis have historically revered Muhammad as the prime personality of spiritual greatness.
The Sufi poet Saadi Shirazi stated, "He who chooses a path contrary to that of the prophet [Muhammad], shall never reach the destination.
O Saadi, do not think that one can treat that way of purity except in the wake of the chosen one [Muhammad]."
Rumi attributes his self-control and abstinence from worldly desires as qualities attained by him through the guidance of Muhammad.
Rumi states, "I 'sewed' my two eyes shut from [desires for] this world and the next – this I learned from Muhammad."
Ibn Arabi regards Muhammad as the greatest man and states, "Muhammad's wisdom is uniqueness ("fardiya") because he is the most perfect existent creature of this human species.
For this reason, the command began with him and was sealed with him.
He was a Prophet while Adam was between water and clay, and his elemental structure is the Seal of the Prophets."
Attar of Nishapur claimed that he praised Muhammad in such a manner that was not done before by any poet, in his book the "Ilahi-nama".
Fariduddin Attar stated, "Muhammad is the exemplar to both worlds, the guide of the descendants of Adam.
He is the sun of creation, the moon of the celestial spheres, the all-seeing eye...The seven heavens and the eight gardens of paradise were created for him, he is both the eye and the light in the light of our eyes."
Sufis have historically stressed the importance of Muhammad's perfection and his ability to intercede.
The persona of Muhammad has historically been and remains an integral and critical aspect of Sufi belief and practice.
Bayazid Bastami is recorded to have been so devoted to the sunnah of Muhammad that he refused to eat a watermelon due to the fact that he could not establish that Muhammad ever ate one.
In the 13th century, a Sufi poet from Egypt, Al-Busiri, wrote the "al-Kawākib ad-Durrīya fī Madḥ Khayr al-Barīya" (The Celestial Lights in Praise of the Best of Creation) commonly referred to as "Qaṣīdat al-Burda" ("Poem of the Mantle"), in which he extensively praised Muhammad.
This poem is still widely recited and sung amongst Sufi groups all over the world.
========,4,Sufi beliefs about Muhammad.
According to Ibn Arabi, Islam is the best religion because of Muhammad.
Ibn Arabi regards that the first entity that was brought into existence is the reality or essence of Muhammad ("al-ḥaqīqa al-Muhammadiyya").
Ibn Arabi regards Muhammad as the supreme human being and master of all creatures.
Muhammad is therefore the primary role-model for human beings to aspire to emulate.
Ibn Arabi believes that God's attributes and names are manifested in this world and that the most complete and perfect display of these divine attributes and names are seen in Muhammad.
Ibn Arabi believes that one may see God in the mirror of Muhammad, meaning that the divine attributes of God are manifested through Muhammad.
Ibn Arabi maintains that Muhammad is the best proof of God and by knowing Muhammad one knows God.
Ibn Arabi also maintains that Muhammad is the master of all of humanity in both this world and the afterlife.
In this view, Islam is the best religion, because Muhammad is Islam.
Sufis maintain that Muhammad is Al-Insān al-Kāmil.
Sufis believe that aid and support may be received from Muhammad, even today.
Sufis believe that Muhammad listens to them when they call upon him.
Sufis strive towards having a relationship with Muhammad and seeking to see Muhammad in a dream is a common Sufi practice.
========,3,Sufism and Islamic law.
Sufis believe the sharia (exoteric "canon"), tariqa (esoteric "order") and haqiqa ("truth") are mutually interdependent.
Sufism leads the adept, called "salik" or "wayfarer", in his "sulûk" or "road" through different stations ("maqaam") until he reaches his goal, the perfect tawhid, the existential confession that God is One.
Ibn Arabi says, "When we see someone in this Community who claims to be able to guide others to God, but is remiss in but one rule of the Sacred Law—even if he manifests miracles that stagger the mind—asserting that his shortcoming is a special dispensation for him, we do not even turn to look at him, for such a person is not a sheikh, nor is he speaking the truth, for no one is entrusted with the secrets of God Most High save one in whom the ordinances of the Sacred Law are preserved.
("Jamiʿ karamat al-awliyaʾ")".
The Amman Message, a detailed statement issued by 200 leading Islamic scholars in 2005 in Amman, and adopted by the Islamic world's political and temporal leaderships at the Organisation of the Islamic Conference summit at Mecca in December 2005, and by six other international Islamic scholarly assemblies including the International Islamic Fiqh Academy of Jeddah, in July 2006, specifically recognized the validity of Sufism as a part of Islam—however the definition of Sufism can vary drastically between different traditions (what may be intended is simple tazkiah as opposed to the various manifestations of Sufism around the Islamic world).
========,3,Traditional Islamic thought and Sufism.
The literature of Sufism emphasizes highly subjective matters that resist outside observation, such as the subtle states of the heart.
Often these resist direct reference or description, with the consequence that the authors of various Sufi treatises took recourse to allegorical language.
For instance, much Sufi poetry refers to intoxication, which Islam expressly forbids.
This usage of indirect language and the existence of interpretations by people who had no training in Islam or Sufism led to doubts being cast over the validity of Sufism as a part of Islam.
Also, some groups emerged that considered themselves above the Sharia and discussed Sufism as a method of bypassing the rules of Islam in order to attain salvation directly.
This was disapproved of by traditional scholars.
For these and other reasons, the relationship between traditional Islamic scholars and Sufism is complex and a range of scholarly opinion on Sufism in Islam has been the norm.
Some scholars, such as Al-Ghazali, helped its propagation while other scholars opposed it.
William Chittick explains the position of Sufism and Sufis this way:
========,3,Traditional and Neo-Sufi groups.
The traditional Sufi orders, which are in majority, emphasize the role of Sufism as a spiritual discipline within Islam.
Therefore, the Sharia (traditional Islamic law) and the Sunnah are seen as crucial for any Sufi aspirant.
One proof traditional orders assert is that almost all the famous Sufi masters of the past Caliphates were experts in Sharia and were renowned as people with great Iman (faith) and excellent practice.
Many were also Qadis (Sharia law judges) in courts.
They held that Sufism was never distinct from Islam and to fully comprehend and practice Sufism one must be an observant Muslim.
"Neo-Sufism," "pseudo-Sufism," and "universal Sufism" are terms used to denote forms of Sufism that do not require adherence to Shariah, or the Muslim faith.
The terms are not always accepted by those it is applied to.
For example, the Afghan-Scottish teacher Idries Shah has been described as a neo-Sufi by the Gurdjieffian James Moore.
The Sufi Order in the West was founded by Inayat Khan, teaching the essential unity of all faiths, and accepting members of all creeds.
Sufism Reoriented is an offshoot of it charted by the syncretistic teacher Meher Baba.
The Golden Sufi Center exists in England, Switzerland and the United States.
It was founded by Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee to continue the work of his teacher Irina Tweedie, herself a practitioner of both Hinduism and neo-Sufism.
Other Western Sufi organisations include the Sufi Foundation of America and the International Association of Sufism.
Western Neo-Sufi practices may differ from traditional forms, for instance having mixed-gender meetings and less emphasis on the Qur'an.
========,2,Theoretical perspectives.
Traditional Islamic scholars have recognized two major branches within the practice of Sufism, and use this as one key to differentiating among the approaches of different masters and devotional lineages.
On the one hand there is the order from the signs to the Signifier (or from the arts to the Artisan).
In this branch, the seeker begins by purifying the lower self of every corrupting influence that stands in the way of recognizing all of creation as the work of God, as God's active Self-disclosure or theophany.
This is the way of Imam Al-Ghazali and of the majority of the Sufi orders.
On the other hand, there is the order from the Signifier to His signs, from the Artisan to His works.
In this branch the seeker experiences divine attraction ("jadhba"), and is able to enter the order with a glimpse of its endpoint, of direct apprehension of the Divine Presence towards which all spiritual striving is directed.
This does not replace the striving to purify the heart, as in the other branch; it simply stems from a different point of entry into the path.
This is the way primarily of the masters of the Naqshbandi and Shadhili orders.
Contemporary scholars may also recognize a third branch, attributed to the late Ottoman scholar Said Nursi and explicated in his vast Qur'an commentary called the Risale-i Nur.
This approach entails strict adherence to the way of Muhammad, in the understanding that this wont, or "sunnah", proposes a complete devotional spirituality adequate to those without access to a master of the Sufi way.
========,3,Contributions to other domains of scholarship.
Sufism has contributed significantly to the elaboration of theoretical perspectives in many domains of intellectual endeavor.
For instance, the doctrine of "subtle centers" or centers of subtle cognition (known as "Lataif-e-sitta") addresses the matter of the awakening of spiritual intuition.
In general, these subtle centers or "latâ'if" are thought of as faculties that are to be purified sequentially in order to bring the seeker's wayfaring to completion.
A concise and useful summary of this system from a living exponent of this tradition has been published by Muhammad Emin Er.
Sufi psychology has influenced many areas of thinking both within and outside of Islam, drawing primarily upon three concepts.
Ja'far al-Sadiq (both an imam in the Shia tradition and a respected scholar and link in chains of Sufi transmission in all Islamic sects) held that human beings are dominated by a lower self called the nafs (soul), a faculty of spiritual intuition called the qalb (heart), and ruh (spirit).
These interact in various ways, producing the spiritual types of the tyrant (dominated by "nafs"), the person of faith and moderation (dominated by the spiritual heart), and the person lost in love for God (dominated by the "ruh").
Of note with regard to the spread of Sufi psychology in the West is Robert Frager, a Sufi teacher authorized in the Khalwati Jerrahi order.
Frager was a trained psychologist, born in the United States, who converted to Islam in the course of his practice of Sufism and wrote extensively on Sufism and psychology.
Sufi cosmology and Sufi metaphysics are also noteworthy areas of intellectual accomplishment.
========,2,Devotional practices.
The devotional practices of Sufis vary widely.
This is because an acknowledged and authorized master of the Sufi path is in effect a physician of the heart, able to diagnose the seeker's impediments to knowledge and pure intention in serving God, and to prescribe to the seeker a course of treatment appropriate to his or her maladies.
The consensus among Sufi scholars is that the seeker cannot self-diagnose, and that it can be extremely harmful to undertake any of these practices alone and without formal authorization.
Prerequisites to practice include rigorous adherence to Islamic norms (ritual prayer in its five prescribed times each day, the fast of Ramadan, and so forth).
Additionally, the seeker ought to be firmly grounded in supererogatory practices known from the life of Muhammad (such as the "sunna prayers").
This is in accordance with the words, attributed to God, of the following, a famous Hadith Qudsi:
My servant draws near to Me through nothing I love more than that which I have made obligatory for him.
My servant never ceases drawing near to Me through supererogatory works until I love him.
Then, when I love him, I am his hearing through which he hears, his sight through which he sees, his hand through which he grasps, and his foot through which he walks.
It is also necessary for the seeker to have a correct creed ("Aqidah"), and to embrace with certainty its tenets.
The seeker must also, of necessity, turn away from sins, love of this world, the love of company and renown, obedience to satanic impulse, and the promptings of the lower self.
(The way in which this purification of the heart is achieved is outlined in certain books, but must be prescribed in detail by a Sufi master.)
The seeker must also be trained to prevent the corruption of those good deeds which have accrued to his or her credit by overcoming the traps of ostentation, pride, arrogance, envy, and long hopes (meaning the hope for a long life allowing us to mend our ways later, rather than immediately, here and now).
Sufi practices, while attractive to some, are not a "means" for gaining knowledge.
The traditional scholars of Sufism hold it as absolutely axiomatic that knowledge of God is not a psychological state generated through breath control.
Thus, practice of "techniques" is not the cause, but instead the "occasion" for such knowledge to be obtained (if at all), given proper prerequisites and proper guidance by a master of the way.
Furthermore, the emphasis on practices may obscure a far more important fact: The seeker is, in a sense, to become a broken person, stripped of all habits through the practice of (in the words of Imam Al-Ghazali) solitude, silence, sleeplessness, and hunger.
Magic may have also been a part of some Sufi practices, notably in India.
The practice of magic intensified during the declining years of Sufism in India when the Sufi orders grew steadily in wealth and in political influence while their spirituality gradually declined and they concentrated on saint veneration, miracle working, magic and superstition.
========,3,Dhikr.
Dhikr is the remembrance of Allah commanded in the Qur'an for all Muslims through a specific devotional act, such as the repetition of divine names, supplications and aphorisms from hadith literature and the Qur'an.
More generally, dhikr takes a wide range and various layers of meaning.
This includes dhikr as any activity in which the Muslim maintains awareness of Allah.
To engage in dhikr is to practice consciousness of the Divine Presence and love, or "to seek a state of godwariness".
The Qur'an refers to Muhammad as the very embodiment of dhikr of Allah (65:10–11).
Some types of dhikr are prescribed for all Muslims and do not require Sufi initiation or the prescription of a Sufi master because they are deemed to be good for every seeker under every circumstance.
The Dhikr may slightly vary among each order.
Some Sufi orders engage in ritualized dhikr ceremonies, or sema.
Sema includes various forms of worship such as: recitation, singing (the most well known being the Qawwali music of the Indian subcontinent), instrumental music, dance (most famously the Sufi whirling of the Mevlevi order), incense, meditation, ecstasy, and trance.
Some Sufi orders stress and place extensive reliance upon Dhikr.
This practice of Dhikr is called Dhikr-e-Qulb (invocation of Allah within the heartbeats).
The basic idea in this practice is to visualize the Allah as having been written on the disciple's heart.
========,3,Muraqaba.
The practice of "muraqaba" can be likened to the practices of meditation attested in many faith communities.
The word "muraqaba" is derived from the same root ("r-q-b") occurring as one of the 99 Names of God in the Qur'an, al-Raqîb, meaning "the Vigilant" and attested in verse 4:1 of the Qur'an.
Through "muraqaba", a person watches over or takes care of the spiritual heart, acquires knowledge about it, and becomes attuned to the Divine Presence, which is ever vigilant.
While variation exists, one description of the practice within a Naqshbandi lineage reads as follows:
He is to collect all of his bodily senses in concentration, and to cut himself off from all preoccupation and notions that inflict themselves upon the heart.
And thus he is to turn his full consciousness towards God Most High while saying three times: ""Ilahî anta maqsûdî wa-ridâka matlûbî"—my God, you are my Goal and Your good pleasure is what I seek".
Then he brings to his heart the Name of the Essence—Allâh—and as it courses through his heart he remains attentive to its meaning, which is "Essence without likeness".
The seeker remains aware that He is Present, Watchful, Encompassing of all, thereby exemplifying the meaning of his saying (may God bless him and grant him peace): "Worship God as though you see Him, for if you do not see Him, He sees you".
And likewise the prophetic tradition: "The most favored level of faith is to know that God is witness over you, wherever you may be".
========,3,Sufi whirling.
Sufi whirling (or "Sufi spinning") is a form of Sama or physically active meditation which originated among Sufis, and which is still practised by the Sufi Dervishes of the Mevlevi order.
It is a customary dance performed within the "sema", through which dervishes (also called "semazens", from Persian ) aim to reach the source of all perfection, or kemal.
This is sought through abandoning one's nafs, egos or personal desires, by listening to the music, focusing on God, and spinning one's body in repetitive circles, which has been seen as a symbolic imitation of planets in the Solar System orbiting the sun.
As explained by Sufis:
In the symbolism of the Sema ritual, the semazen's camel's hair hat (sikke) represents the tombstone of the ego; his wide, white skirt ("tennure") represents the ego's shroud.
By removing his black cloak ("hırka"), he is spiritually reborn to the truth.
At the beginning of the Sema, by holding his arms crosswise, the semazen appears to represent the number one, thus testifying to God's unity.
While whirling, his arms are open: his right arm is directed to the sky, ready to receive God's beneficence; his left hand, upon which his eyes are fastened, is turned toward the earth.
The semazen conveys God's spiritual gift to those who are witnessing the Sema.
Revolving from right to left around the heart, the semazen embraces all humanity with love.
The human being has been created with love in order to love.
Mevlâna Jalâluddîn Rumi says, "All loves are a bridge to Divine love.
Yet, those who have not had a taste of it do not know!"
========,3,Visitation.
In popular Sufism (i.e.
devotional practices that have achieved currency in world cultures through Sufi influence), one common practice is to visit or make pilgrimages to the tombs of saints, renowned scholars, and righteous people.
This is a particularly common practice in South Asia, where famous tombs include such saints as Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani in Kulob, Tajikistan; Afāq Khoja, near Kashgar, China; Lal Shahbaz Qalandar in Sindh; Ali Hajwari in Lahore, Pakistan; Bawaldin Zikrya in Multan Pakistan; Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer, India; Nizamuddin Auliya in Delhi, India; and Shah Jalal in Sylhet, Bangladesh.
Likewise, in Fez, Morocco, a popular destination for such pious visitation is the Zaouia Moulay Idriss II and the yearly visitation to see the current Sheikh of the Qadiri Boutchichi Tariqah, Sheikh Sidi Hamza al Qadiri al Boutchichi to celebrate the Mawlid (which is usually televised on Moroccan National television).
The purpose of such visitations is usually two-fold, first and foremost the aim is to receive spiritual guidance and blessings from the saint who rests in the shrine, which helps the seeker in his or her own path towards enlightenment.
Secondly, the saint is also approached for intercession in prayers, be it in worldly matters or religious.
========,2,Persecution.
Persecution of Sufis and Sufism has included destruction of Sufi shrines and mosques, suppression of orders, and discrimination against adherents in a number of Muslim countries.
The Turkish Republican state banned all Sufi orders and abolished their institutions in 1925 after Sufis opposed the new secular order.
The Iranian Islamic Republic has harassed Shia Sufis, reportedly for their lack of support for the government doctrine of "" (i.e., that the supreme Shiite jurist should be the nation's political leader).
In most other Muslim countries, attacks on Sufis and especially their shrines have come from adherents of puritanical schools of thought who believe that practices such as celebration of the birthdays of Sufi saints, and dhikr ("remembrance" of God) ceremonies are bid‘ah or impure innovation, and polytheistic (Shirk).
========,3,History.
In the Safavid dynasty of Iran, "both the wandering dervishes of 'low' Sufism" and "the philosopher-ulama of 'high' Sufism came under relentless pressure" from powerful cleric Muhammad Baqir Majlisi (d1110/1699).
Majlisi—"one of the most powerful and influential" Twelver Shiʿi "ulama" "of all time"—was famous for (among other things), suppression of Sufism, which he and his followers believed paid insufficient attention to Shariah law.
Prior to Majlisi's rise, Shiism and Sufism had been "closely linked".
In 1843, the Senussi Sufi were forced to flee Mecca and Medina and head to Sudan and Libya.
According to a 2005 article in "The Guardian":
========,3,Current attacks.
In recent years, shrines, and sometimes mosques, have been damaged or destroyed in many parts of the Muslim world.
Some Sufi adherents have been killed as well.
Ali Gomaa, a Sufi scholar and Grand Mufti of al-Azhar University, has criticized the destruction of shrines and public property as unacceptable.
========,4,Pakistan.
Since March 2005, 209 people have been killed and 560 injured in 29 different terrorist attacks targeting shrines devoted to Sufi saints in Pakistan, according to data compiled by the Center for Islamic Research Collaboration and Learning (CIRCLe, a think-tank based in Rawalpindi).
At least as of 2010, the attacks have increased each year.
Pro-Sufism Barelvis dominate Pakistan's religious landscape, and are victims of the anti-Sufi campaigns of the Deobandi according to author John R. Schmidt.
Deobandi and Barelvi are the "two major sub-sects" of Sunni Muslims in South Asia that have clashed—sometimes violently—since the late 1970s in Pakistan.
It is not clear whether Sufis are being persecuted by Barelvi or Deobandi state banned militant organizations, since both groups have been accused of anti-Shia terrorism.
In 2005, militant organizations began attacking "symbols" of the Barelvi community such as mosques, prominent religious leaders, and shrines.
========,4,Kashmir, India.
In this predominately Muslim, traditionally Sufi region, some six places of worship have been either completely or partially burnt in "mysterious fires" in several months leading up to November 2012.
The most prominent victim of damage was the Dastageer Sahib Sufi shrine in Srinagar which burned in June 2012, injuring 20.
While investigators have so far found no sign of arson, according to journalist Amir Rana the fires have occurred within the context of a surging Salafi movement which preaches that "Kashmiri tradition of venerating the tombs and relics of saints is outside the pale of Islam".
Mourners outside the burning shrine cursed the Salafis for creating an atmosphere of hate, [while] some Salafis began posting incendiary messages on Facebook, terming the destruction of the shrine a "divine act of God".
========,4,Somalia.
Under the Al-Shabab rule in Somali, Sufi ceremonies were banned and shrines destroyed.
As the power of Al-Shabab has waned, however, Sufi ceremonies are said to have "re-emerged".
Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a Sufi militants, backed by Ethiopia and the federal government, control parts of central Somalia and some cities in the southern regions of Gedo and Bakool.
========,4,Mali.
In the ancient city of Timbuktu, sometimes called "the city of 333 saints", UNESCO reports that as many as half of the city's shrines "have been destroyed in a display of fanaticism", as of July 2012.
A spokesman for Ansar Dine has stated that "the destruction is a divine order", and that the group had plans to destroy every single Sufi shrine in the city, "without exception".
In Gao and Kidal, as well as Timbuktu, Salafi Islamists have destroyed musical instruments and driven musicians (music is not Haraam under Salafi Islam) into "economic exile" away from Mali.
International Criminal Court Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda described the Islamists' actions as a "war crime".
========,4,Egypt.
A May 2010 ban by the ministry of awqaf (religious endowments) of centuries old Sufi dhikr gatherings (devoted to the remembrance of God, and including dancing and religious songs) has been described as a "another victory for extreme Salafi thinking at the expense of Egypt's moderate Sufism".
Clashes followed at Cairo's Al-Hussein Mosque and al-Sayyida Zeinab mosques between members of Sufi orders and security forces who forced them to evacuate the two shrines.
In 2009, the moulid of al-Sayyida Zeinab, Muhammad's granddaughter, was banned ostensibly over concern over the spread of swine flu but also at the urging of Salafis.
According to Gaber Qassem, deputy of the Sufi Orders, approximately 14 shrines have been violated in Egypt since the January 2011 revolution.
According to Sheikh Tarek El-Rifai, head of the Rifai Sufi Order, a number of Salafis have prevented Sufi prayers in Al-Haram.
Sheikh Rifai said that the order's lawyer has filed a report at the Al-Haram police station to that effect.
In early April 2011, a Sufi march from Al-Azhar Mosque to Al-Hussein Mosque was followed by a massive protest before Al-Hussein Mosque, "expressing outrage at the destruction" of Sufi shrines.
The Islamic Research Centre of Egypt, led by Grand Imam of Al-Azhar Ahmed El-Tayeb, has also denounced the attacks on the shrines.
According to the Muslim Brotherhood website ikhwanweb.com, in 2011 "a memorandum was submitted to the Armed Forces" citing 20 "encroachments" on Sufi shrines.
========,4,Libya.
In the aftermath of the 2011 Libyan Civil War, several Sufi religious sites in Libya were deliberately destroyed or damaged.
In the weeks leading up to September 2012, "armed groups motivated by their religious views" attacked Sufi religious sites across the country, "destroying several mosques and tombs of Sufi religious leaders and scholars".
Perpetrators were described as "groups that have a strict Islamic ideology where they believe that graves and shrines must be desecrated."
Libyan Interior Minister Fawzi Abdel A'al, was quoted as saying, "If all shrines in Libya are destroyed so we can avoid the death of one person [in clashes with security forces], then that is a price we are ready to pay."
In September 2012, three people were killed in clashes between residents of Rajma, southeast of Benghazi, and Salafist Islamists trying to destroy a Sufi shrine in Rajma, the Sidi al-Lafi mausoleum.
In August 2012 the United Nations cultural agency UNESCO urged Libyan authorities to protect Sufi mosques and shrines from attacks by Islamic hardliners "who consider the traditional mystical school of Islam heretical".
The attacked have "wrecked mosques in at least three cities and desecrated many graves of revered Sufi scholars".
========,4,Tunisia.
Tunisian Sufis largely adher to the Shadiliyya order.
Despite the rise of Salafism and extremists in Tunisia, Sufism is still largely ingrained in its culture.
Media site Al-Monitor reported that 39 Sufi shrines were destroyed or desecrated from the 2011 revolution to January 2013.
For Tunisians Sufism is a way of collective healing and progress.
The polling agency Sigma indicated that 43.1% Tunisians visit a Sufi shrine at least once per year.
Sufi Shrines(Zawiya) in Tunisia exceed the number of mosques.
========,4,Dagestan.
Said Atsayev—also known as Sheikh Said Afandi al-Chirkavi—a prominent 74-year-old Sufi Muslim spiritual leader in Dagestan Russia, was killed by a suicide bombing August 28, 2012 along with six of his followers.
His murder follows "similar religiously motivated killings" in Dagestan and regions of ex-Soviet Central Asia, targeting religious leaders—not necessarily Sufi—who disapprove of violent jihad.
Afandi had survived previous attempts on his life and was reportedly in the process of negotiating a peace agreement between the Sufis and Salafis.
========,4,Iran.
Matthijs van den Bos discusses the status of Sufism in Iran in the 19th and 20th century.
According to Seyed Mostafa Azmayesh, an expert on Sufism and the representative of the Ni'matullāhī order outside Iran, a campaign against the Sufis in Iran (or at least Shia Sufis) began in 2005.
Several books were published arguing that because Sufis follow their own spiritual leaders they do not believe in the Islamic state's theocratic principle of the and should therefore be treated as second-class citizens, not allowed to have government jobs, or be fired if they do.
Since then the Ni'matullāhī order—Iran's largest Sufi order—has come under increasing state pressure.
Three of its khanqahs have been demolished.
Officials accused it of not having building permits and of narcotics possession—charges which the Sufis reject.
The government of Iran is considering an outright ban on Sufism, according to the 2009 Annual Report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom.
It also reports:
In 2009 the mausoleum of the 19th century Sufi poet Nasir Ali and an adjoining Sufi prayer house were bulldozed.
Not all Sufis in Iran have been subject to government pressure.
Sunni dervish orders—such as the Qhaderi dervishes—in the Sunni-populated parts of the country are thought by some to be seen as allies of the government against Al-Qaeda.
========,2,Prominent Sufis.
========,3,Abul Hasan ash-Shadhili.
Abul Hasan ash-Shadhili (died 1258), the founder of the Shadhiliyya order, introduced "dhikr jahri" (the remembrance of God outloud, as opposed to the silent "dhikr").
He taught that his followers need not abstain from what Islam has not forbidden, but to be grateful for what God has bestowed upon them, in contrast to the majority of Sufis, who preach to deny oneself and to destroy the ego-self ("nafs") and its worldly desires.
These two ways are sometimes referred to as "Order of Patience" (Tariqus-Sabr), as opposed to the "Order of Gratitude" (Tariqush-Shukr).
Imam Shadhili also gave eighteen valuable "hizbs" (litanies) to his followers out of which the notable "Hizb al-Bahr" is recited worldwide even today.
========,3,Abdul-Qadir Gilani.
Abdul-Qadir Gilani (1077–1166) was a Persian Hanbali jurist and Sufi based in Baghdad.
Qadiriyya was his patronym.
Gilani spent his early life in Na'if, the town of his birth.

He was given lessons about Hadith by Abu Bakr ibn Muzaffar.
He was given lessons about Tafsir by Abu Muhammad Ja'far, a commentator.
His Sufi spiritual instructor was Abu'l-Khair Hammad ibn Muslim al-Dabbas.
After completing his education, Gilani left Baghdad.
He spent twenty-five years as a reclusive wanderer in the desert regions of Iraq.
In 1127, Gilani returned to Baghdad and began to preach to the public.
He joined the teaching staff of the school belonging to his own teacher, Abu Saeed Mubarak Makhzoomi, and was popular with students.
In the morning he taught hadith and tafsir, and in the afternoon he held discourse on the science of the heart and the virtues of the Qur'an.

Muhyiddin Muhammad b.
'Ali Ibn 'Arabi (or Ibn al-'Arabi) AH 561- AH 638 (July 28, 1165 – November 10, 1240) is considered to be one of the most important Sufi masters, although he never founded any order ("tariqa").
His writings, especially al-Futuhat al-Makkiyya and Fusus al-hikam, have been studied within all the Sufi orders as the clearest expression of "tawhid" (Divine Unity), though because of their recondite nature they were often only given to initiates.
Later those who followed his teaching became known as the school of "wahdat al-wujud" (the Oneness of Being).
He himself considered his writings to have been divinely inspired.
As he expressed the Way to one of his close disciples, his legacy is that 'you should never ever abandon your servant-hood ("ʿubudiyya"), and that there may never be in your soul a longing for any existing thing'.
========,3,Junayd of Baghdad.
Junayd of Baghdad (830–910) was one of the great early Sufis.
His order was Junaidia, which links to the golden chain of many Sufi orders.
He laid the groundwork for sober mysticism in contrast to that of God-intoxicated Sufis like al-Hallaj, Bayazid Bastami and Abusaeid Abolkheir.
During the trial of al-Hallaj, his former disciple, the Caliph of the time demanded his fatwa.
In response, he issued this fatwa: "From the outward appearance he is to die and we judge according to the outward appearance and God knows better".
He is referred to by Sufis as Sayyid-ut Taifa—i.e., the leader of the group.
He lived and died in the city of Baghdad.
========,3,Moinuddin Chishti.

The initial spiritual chain or silsila of the Chishti order in India, comprising Moinuddin Chishti, Bakhtiyar Kaki, Baba Farid, Nizamuddin Auliya (each successive person being the disciple of the previous one), constitutes the great Sufi saints of Indian history.
Moinuddin Chishtī turned towards India, reputedly after a dream in which Muhammad blessed him to do so.
After a brief stay at Lahore, he reached Ajmer along with Sultan Shahāb-ud-Din Muhammad Ghori, and settled down there.
In Ajmer, he attracted a substantial following, acquiring a great deal of respect amongst the residents of the city.
Moinuddin Chishtī practiced the Sufi Sulh-e-Kul (peace to all) concept to promote understanding between Muslims and non-Muslims
========,3,Ahmed Ullah Maizbhandari.
Ahmed Ullah Maizbhanderi was born on January 15, 1826, corresponding to Magh 1, 1233 of the Bengali calendar year.
Sufi scholar Mohiuddin Ibn Arabi was said to have predicted the birth of Ahamed Ullah Maizbhanderi, 586 years earlier.
The Tarika-e-Maizbhandari is an order established in the Bangladesh in the 19th century by the Gausul Azam Hazrat Shah Sufi Syed Ahmadullah Maizbhandari (1826 AD − 1906 AD), 27th descendent of Muhammad.
The Maizbhandari Tariqa or Maizbhandari Sufi Order is based on seven methods to follow which make a man in perfect one with moral control and self purification.

========,3,Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya.
Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya (died 801) was a flautist, mystic, and pilgrim who represents the distinctly countercultural elements of Sufism, especially with regards to the status and power of women.
Prominent Sufi leader Hasan of Basra is said to have castigated himself before her superior merits and sincere virtues.
Rabi'a was born either a slave or a servant of very poor origin, released by her master when he awoke one night to see the light of sanctity shining above her head.
Rabi'a al-Adawiyya is known for her teachings and emphasis on the centrality of the love of God to a holy life.
Running down the streets of Basra, Iraq, she proclaimed:
She died in Jerusalem and is thought to have been buried in the Chapel of the Ascension.
========,3,Mansur Al-Hallaj.
Mansur Al-Hallaj (died 922) is renowned for his claim, "Ana-l-Haqq" ("I am The Truth").
His refusal to recant this utterance, which was regarded as apostasy, led to a long trial.
He was imprisoned for 11 years in a Baghdad prison, before being tortured and publicly dismembered on March 26, 922.
He is still revered by Sufis for his willingness to embrace torture and death rather than recant.
It is said that during his prayers, he would say "O Lord!
You are the guide of those who are passing through the Valley of Bewilderment.
If I am a heretic, enlarge my heresy".
========,2,Sufi orders.
The term "Tariqa" is used for a school or order of Sufism, or especially for the mystical teaching and spiritual practices of such an order with the aim of seeking ḥaqīqah (ultimate truth).
A tariqa has a murshid (guide) who plays the role of leader or spiritual director.
The members or followers of a tariqa are known as murīdīn (singular murīd), meaning "desirous", viz.
"desiring the knowledge of knowing God and loving God".
========,3,Chishti.
The Chishti Order () was founded by (Khawaja) Abu Ishaq Shami ("the Syrian"; died 941) who brought Sufism to the town of Chisht, some 95 miles east of Herat in present-day Afghanistan.
Before returning to the Levant, Shami initiated, trained and deputized the son of the local Emir (Khwaja) Abu Ahmad Abdal (died 966).
Under the leadership of Abu Ahmad's descendants, the "Chishtiyya" as they are also known, flourished as a regional mystical order.
========,3,Kubrawiya.
The Kubrawiya order is a Sufi order ("tariqa") named after its 13th-century founder Najmuddin Kubra.
The Kubrawiya Sufi order was founded in the 13th century by Najmuddin Kubra in Bukhara in modern Uzbekistan.
The Mongols had captured Bukhara in 1221, they committed genocide and killed nearly the whole population.
Sheikh Nadjm ed-Din Kubra was among those killed by the Mongols.
========,3,Naqshbandi.
The Naqshbandi order is one of the major Sufi orders of Islam, previously known as Siddiqiyya as the order stems from Mohammad through Abū Bakr as-Șiddīq.
It is considered by some to be a "sober" order known for its silent dhikr (remembrance of God) rather than the vocalized forms of dhikr common in other orders.
The word "Naqshbandi" () is Persian, taken from the name of the founder of the order, Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari.
Some have said that the translation means "related to the image-maker", some also consider it to mean "Pattern Maker" rather than "image maker", and interpret "Naqshbandi" to mean "Reformer of Patterns", and others consider it to mean "Way of the Chain" or "Silsilat al-dhahab".
========,4,Khālidīyyā.
Khālidīyyā Sufi Order is a branch of the Naqshbandiyya Sufi Silsilat al-dhahab.

========,3,Nimatullahi.
The Ni'matullāhī order is the most widespread Sufi order of Persia today.
It was founded by Shah Ni'matullah Wali (died 1367), established and transformed from his inheritance of the Ma'rufiyyah circle.
There are several suborders in existence today, the most known and influential in the West following the lineage of Dr. Javad Nurbakhsh who brought the order to the West following the 1979 Revolution in Iran.
========,3,Nurbakshi.
The "Noorbakshia" () also called Nubakshia is an Islamic sect and the Sufi order and way that claims to trace its direct spiritual lineage and chain (silsilah) to the Islamic prophet Muhammad, through Ali, by way of Imam Ali Al-Ridha.
This order became famous as Nurbakshi after Shah Syed Muhammad Nurbakhsh Qahistani who was attached with Kubrawiya order Sufi order ("tariqa").
========,3,Owaisi "(Uwaiysi)".
The Owaisi "(Uwaiysi)" order claim to be founded 1,400 years ago by Uwais al-Qarni from Yemen.
Uways received the teachings of Islam inwardly through his heart and lived by the principles taught by him, although he had never physically met Muhammad.
At times Muhammad would say of him, "I feel the breath of the Merciful, coming to me from Yemen."
Shortly before Muhammad died, he directed Umar (second Caliph) and Ali (the fourth Caliph) to take his cloak to Uwais.
"According to Ali Hujwiri, Farid ad-Din Attar of Nishapur and Sheikh Muhammad Ghader Bagheri, the first recipient of Muhammad's cloak was Uwais al-Qarni.
The 'Original Cloak' as it is known is thought to have passed down the generations from the prophet Abraham to Muhammad, to Uwais al-Qarni, and so on."
The Oveyssi order exists today in various forms and in different countries.
According to Dr. Alan Godlas of the University of Georgia's Department of Religion, a Sufi Order or tariqa known as the Uwaysi is "very active", having been introduced in the West by the 20th century Sufi, Shah Maghsoud Angha.
The Uwaysi Order is a Shi'i branch of the Kubrawiya.
In Pakistan several branches of owaisi silsila exist, notably the Silsila of Shams Ali Qalandar owaisi, qadri, noshahi with followers present all over the world, articles on tasawuf are given on order's official site.
Godlas writes that there are two recent and distinct contemporary branches of the Uwaysi Order in the West:
Uwaiysi Tarighat, led by Shah Maghsoud Sadegh Angha's daughter, Seyyedeh Dr. Nahid Angha, and her husband Shah Nazar Seyed Ali Kianfar.
Dr. Angha and Dr. Kianfar went on to found another the International Association of Sufism (IAS) which operates in California and organizes international Sufi symposia.

With the use of modern technology and reach of the internet, weekly webcasts of the order's lecture and zekr sessions are broadcast live through the order's official website.
========,3,Qadiri.
The Qadiri Order is one of the oldest Sufi Orders.
It derives its name from Abdul-Qadir Gilani (1077–1166), a native of the Iranian province of Gīlān.
The order is one of the most widespread of the Sufi orders in the Islamic world, and can be found in Central Asia, Turkey, Balkans and much of East and West Africa.
The Qadiriyyah have not developed any distinctive doctrines or teachings outside of mainstream Islam.
They believe in the fundamental principles of Islam, but interpreted through mystical experience.
========,3,Sarwari Qadri.
The Sarwari Qadri order was founded by Sultan Bahu which branched out of the Qadiriyyah order.
Hence, it follows the same approach of the order but unlike most Sufi orders, it does not follow a specific dress code, seclusion, or other lengthy exercises.
Its mainstream philosophy is related directly to the heart and contemplating on the name of Allah i.e.
the word الله (Allah, God) as written on own heart.
========,3,Senussi.
Senussi is a religious-political Sufi order established by Muhammad ibn Ali as-Senussi.
Muhammad ibn Ali as-Senussi founded this movement due to his criticism of the Egyptian ulema.
Originally from Mecca, as-Senussi left due to pressure from Wahhabis to leave and settled in Cyrenaica where he was well received.
Idris bin Muhammad al-Mahdi as-Senussi was later recognized as Emir of Cyrenaica and eventually became King of Libya.
The monarchy was abolished by Muammar Gaddafi but, a third of Libyan still claim to be Senussi.
========,3,Shadiliyya.
The Shadhili is a Sufi order founded by Abu-l-Hassan ash-Shadhili.
Murids (followers) of the Shadhiliyya are often known as Shadhilis.
========,3,Suhrawardiyya.
The Suhrawardiyya order () is a Sufi order founded by Abu al-Najib al-Suhrawardi (1097–1168).
The order was formalized by his nephew, Shahab al-Din Abu Hafs Umar Suhrawardi.
========,2,Reception.
========,3,Critique of Sufism's anti-materialistic aspects.
Certain aspects of Sufi philosophy are controversial and often debated, chief among them is the anti-materialistic strain within its ethos.
Gamal Marzouq, Professor of Islamic Philosophy in Ain-Shams University, in his paper titled "The effect of Christianity on the first emergence of Islamic Sufism", has highlighted the monastic and anti-materialist trends within Sufism, calling attention to their "abandoning materialism and living only for praying, something similar to monasticism".
Conversely, the Quran calls out monasticism as a human invention not prescribed by God in the verse 57:27: "monasticism, which they innovated; We did not prescribe it for them...".
Furthermore, there is much emphasis on physical laws of the universe within the Quran, urging believers to study and understand the "signs" of God in the physical world (e.g.
verse 2:164), which precludes the possibility of avoiding or shunning the material world.
Ibrahim B. Syed has called attention to the fact that the only definition of the word "alim" in the Quran, a word commonly understood to mean "religious leader" today, is actually referring to scientists, indicating the high importance afforded by the Quran to the material world and the act of engaging with it, so as to understand God's universe.
There are also the active aspects of the Quran's teachings which urge believers to seek to improve the human condition and work to establish the laws of God within human society (verse 22:41), a mission that does not fit well with the hermetic and monastic tendencies within Sufism.
========,3,Perception outside Islam.
Sufi mysticism has long exercised a fascination upon the Western world, and especially its Orientalist scholars.
Figures like Rumi have become well known in the United States, where Sufism is perceived as a peaceful and apolitical form of Islam.
Orientalists have proposed a variety of diverse theories pertaining to the nature of Sufism, such as it being influenced by Neoplatonism or as an Aryan historical reaction against "Semitic" cultural influence.
Hossein Nasr states that the preceding theories are false according to the point of view of Sufism.
The Islamic Institute in Mannheim, Germany, which works towards the integration of Europe and Muslims, sees Sufism as particularly suited for interreligious dialogue and intercultural harmonisation in democratic and pluralist societies; it has described Sufism as a symbol of tolerance and humanism—nondogmatic, flexible and non-violent.
According to Philip Jenkins, a Professor at Baylor University, "the Sufis are much more than tactical allies for the West: they are, potentially, the greatest hope for pluralism and democracy within Muslim nations."
Likewise, several governments and organisations have advocated the promotion of Sufism as a means of combating intolerant and violent strains of Islam.
For example, the Chinese and Russian governments openly favor Sufism as the best means of protecting against Islamist subversion.
The British government, especially following the 7 July 2005 London bombings, has favoured Sufi groups in its battle against Muslim extremist currents.
The influential RAND Corporation, an American think-tank, issued a major report titled "Building Moderate Muslim Networks," which urged the US government to form links with and bolster Muslim groups that opposed Islamist extremism.
The report stressed the Sufi role as moderate traditionalists open to change, and thus as allies against violence.
News organisations such as the BBC, Economist and Boston Globe have also seen Sufism as a means to deal with violent Muslim extremists.
Idries Shah states that Sufism is universal in nature, its roots predating the rise of Islam and Christianity.
Shah's views have however been rejected by modern scholars.
Such modern trends of neo-Sufis in Western countries allow non-Muslims to receive "instructions on following the Sufi path", not without opposition by Muslims who consider such instruction outside the sphere of Islam.
========,3,Influence on Judaism.
Both Judaism and Islam are monotheistic.
However, there is evidence that Sufism did influence the development of some schools of Jewish philosophy and ethics.
A great influence was exercised by Sufism upon the ethical writings of Jews in the Middle Ages.
In the first writing of this kind, we see "Kitab al-Hidayah ila Fara'iḍ al-Ḳulub", "Duties of the Heart", of Bahya ibn Paquda.
This book was translated by Judah ibn Tibbon into Hebrew under the title "Ḥōḇōṯ Ha-lleḇāḇōṯ".
This was precisely the argument used by the Sufis against their adversaries, the Ulamas.
The arrangement of the book seems to have been inspired by Sufism.
Its ten sections correspond to the ten stages through which the Sufi had to pass in order to attain that true and passionate love of God which is the aim and goal of all ethical self-discipline.
A considerable amount of Sufi ideas entered the Jewish mainstream through Bahya ibn Paquda's work, which remains one of the most popular ethical treatises in Judaism.
It is noteworthy that in the ethical writings of the Sufis Al-Kusajri and Al-Harawi there are sections which treat of the same subjects as those treated in the "Ḥovot ha-Lebabot" and which bear the same titles: e.g., "Bab al-Tawakkul"; "Bab al-Taubah"; "Bab al-Muḥasabah"; "Bab al-Tawaḍu'"; "Bab al-Zuhd".
In the ninth gate, Baḥya directly quotes sayings of the Sufis, whom he calls "Perushim".
However, the author of the "Ḥōḇōṯ Ha-lleḇāḇōṯ" did not go so far as to approve of the asceticism of the Sufis, although he showed a marked predilection for their ethical principles.
The Jewish writer Abraham bar Hiyya teaches the asceticism of the Sufis.
His distinction with regard to the observance of Jewish law by various classes of men is essentially a Sufic theory.
According to it there are four principal degrees of human perfection or sanctity; namely:
Abraham ben Moses ben Maimon, the son of the Jewish philosopher Maimonides, believed that Sufi practices and doctrines continue the tradition of the Biblical prophets.
See Sefer Hammaspiq, "Happerishuth", Chapter 11 ("Ha-mmaʿaḇāq") s.v.
hithbonen efo be-masoreth mufla'a zo, citing the Talmudic explanation of Jeremiah 13:27 in Chagigah 5b; in Rabbi Yaakov Wincelberg's translation, "The Way of Serving God" (Feldheim), p. 429 and above, p. 427.
Also see ibid., Chapter 10 ("Iqquḇim"), s.v.
wa-halo yoḏeʾaʿ atta; in "The Way of Serving God", p. 371.
There are other such references in Rabbi Abraham's writings, as well.
He introduced into the Jewish prayer such practices as reciting God's names (dhikr).
Abraham Maimuni's principal work is originally composed in Judeo-Arabic and entitled "כתאב כפאיה אלעאבדין" "Kitāb Kifāyah al-'Ābidīn" ("A Comprehensive Guide for the Servants of God").
From the extant surviving portion it is conjectured that Maimuni's treatise was three times as long as his father's Guide for the Perplexed.
In the book, Maimuni evidences a great appreciation for, and affinity to, Sufism.
Followers of his path continued to foster a Jewish-Sufi form of pietism for at least a century, and he is rightly considered the founder of this pietistic school, which was centered in Egypt.
The followers of this path, which they called, interchangeably, Hasidism (not to be confused with the [later] Jewish Hasidic movement) or Sufism (Tasawwuf), practiced spiritual retreats, solitude, fasting and sleep deprivation.
The Jewish Sufis maintained their own brotherhood, guided by a religious leader—like a Sufi sheikh.
Abraham Maimuni's two sons, Obadyah and David, continued to lead this Jewish-Sufi brotherhood.
Obadyah Maimonides wrote "Al-Mawala Al Hawdiyya" ("The Treatise of the Pool")—an ethico-mystical manual based on the typically Sufi comparison of the heart to a pool that must be cleansed before it can experience the Divine.
The Maimonidean legacy extended right through to the 15th century with the 5th generation of Maimonidean Sufis, David ben Joshua Maimonides, who wrote "Al-Murshid ila al-Tafarrud" (The Guide to Detachment), which includes numerous extracts of Suhrawardi's "Kalimat at-Tasawwuf".

Elif Şafak's novel "The Forty Rules of Love" is a fictionalized account of Rumi's encounter with the Persian dervish Shams Tabrizi.
Furthermore, between 1910 and 1911 one of the first Sufi journals, called "Hikmet", was published in Istanbul by Ahmad Hilmi of Filibe.
Another Sufi-oriented journal was published in Egypt between 1931 and 1934.
"Al-Maʿrifa" informed among others about Sufi moral and wisdom.
