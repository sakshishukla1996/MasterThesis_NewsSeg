========,2,Canada.
In Canada, summary offences are referred to as summary conviction offences.
As in other jurisdictions, summary conviction offences are considered less serious than indictable offences because they are punishable by shorter prison sentences and smaller fines.
These offences appear both in the federal laws of Canada and in the legislation of Canada's provinces and territories.
For summary conviction offences that fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government (which includes all criminal law), section 787 of the Criminal Code specifies that, unless another punishment is provided for by law, the maximum penalty for a summary conviction offence is a sentence of 6 months of imprisonment, a fine of $5,000 or both.
As a matter of practical effect, some common differences between summary conviction and indictable offences are provided below.
========,2,United Kingdom.
In relation to England and Wales, the expression "summary offence" means an offence which, if committed by an adult, is tried by a summary procedure.
In such proceedings there is no jury, the appointed judge decides the guilt or innocence of the accused.
Each summary offence is specified by statute which describes the (usually minor) offence and the judge to hear it.
A summary procedure can result in a summary conviction.
In this definition, references to the way in which an offence is triable are to be construed without regard to the effect, if any, of section 22 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 on the mode of trial in a particular case.
Sir William Blackstone, in his Commentaries on the Laws of England, described summary offences thus:
In the United Kingdom, trials for summary offences are heard in one of a number of types of lower court.
For England and Wales this is the Magistrates' Court.
In Scotland, it is the Sheriff Court or Justice of the peace court, depending on the offence (the latter being primarily for the most minor of offences).
Northern Ireland has its own Magistrates' Court system.
========,2,United States.
In the United States, "there are certain minor or petty offenses that may be proceeded against summarily, and without a jury".
Any crime punishable by more than six months imprisonment must have some means for a jury trial.
Federal law is codified at .
Some states, such as California, provide that all common law crimes and misdemeanors require a jury trial.
Some states provide that in all offenses the defendant may demand a jury trial.
(Note that the right to trial by jury is the exclusive right of the defendant, if the defendant chooses to select a bench trial (trial by judge) the prosecution cannot object.)
Contempt of court is considered a prerogative of the court, as "the requirement of a jury does not apply to 'contempts committed in disobedience of any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command entered in any suit or action brought or prosecuted in the name of, or on behalf of, the United States'".
There have been criticisms over the practice.
In particular, Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black wrote in a dissent, "It is high time, in my judgment, to wipe out root and branch the judge-invented and judge-maintained notion that judges can try criminal contempt cases without a jury."
