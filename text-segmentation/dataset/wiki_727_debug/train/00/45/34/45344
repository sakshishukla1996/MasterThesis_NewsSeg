Collision is used in two slightly different senses in theoretical computer science and telecommunications.
In computer science it refers to a situation where a function maps two distinct inputs to the same output.
In telecommunications, a collision occurs when two nodes of a network attempt to transmit at the same time.
========,2,In theoretical computer science.
A collision or clash occurs when two different inputs to a function, typically one used to compress large data items into a smaller or fixed size, produce the same output, called (depending on the application) a hash value, checksum, fingerprint, or digest.
Collisions are unavoidable whenever members of a very large set (such as all possible person names, or all possible computer files) are mapped to a relatively short bit string.
This is merely an instance of the pigeonhole principle.
========,2,In telecommunications.
Half-duplex (HDX) data communications networks have the possibility that more than one node will transmit at the same or overlapping time.
This event is referred to as a collision.
The messages sent by the transmitting nodes are corrupted.
The receiving nodes will receive (in most but not all cases) random data.
In half-duplex networks, the transmitting node must ensure that the network is quiet prior to transmitting, and in addition there is usually some mechanism for transmitting nodes to detect overlapping transmissions.
