========,1,preface.
A cluster munition is a form of air-dropped or ground-launched explosive weapon that releases or ejects smaller submunitions.
Commonly, this is a cluster bomb that ejects explosive bomblets that are designed to kill personnel and destroy vehicles.
Other cluster munitions are designed to destroy runways or electric power transmission lines, disperse chemical or biological weapons, or to scatter land mines.
Some submunition-based weapons can disperse non-munitions, such as leaflets.
Because cluster bombs release many small bomblets over a wide area, they pose risks to civilians both during attacks and afterwards.
Unexploded bomblets can kill or maim civilians and/or unintended targets long after a conflict has ended, and are costly to locate and remove.
Cluster munitions are prohibited for those nations that ratify the Convention on Cluster Munitions, adopted in Dublin, Ireland in May 2008.
The Convention entered into force and became binding international law upon ratifying states on 1 August 2010, six months after being ratified by 30 states.
As of 1 October 2015, a total of 118 states have joined the Convention, as 98 States parties and 20 Signatories.
========,2,Development.
The first cluster bomb used operationally was the German SD-2 or "Sprengbombe Dickwandig 2Â kg", commonly referred to as the Butterfly Bomb.
It was used in World War II to attack both civilian and military targets.
The technology was developed independently by the United States, Russia and Italy (see Thermos Bomb).
The US used the 20-lb M41 fragmentation bomb wired together in clusters of 6 or 25 with highly sensitive or proximity fuzes.
From the 1970s to the 1990s cluster bombs became standard air-dropped munitions for many nations, in a wide variety of types.
They have been produced by 34 countries and used in at least 23.
Artillery shells that employ similar principles have existed for decades.
They are typically referred to as ICM (Improved Conventional Munitions) shells.
The US military slang terms for them are "firecracker" or "popcorn" shells, for the many small explosions they cause in the target area.
========,2,Types.
A basic cluster bomb consists of a hollow shell and then two to more than 2,000 submunitions or bomblets contained within it.
Some types are dispensers that are designed to be retained by the aircraft after releasing their munitions.
The submunitions themselves may be fitted with small parachute retarders or streamers to slow their descent (allowing the aircraft to escape the blast area in low-altitude attacks).
Modern cluster bombs and submunition dispensers are often multiple-purpose weapons, containing mixtures of anti-armor, anti-personnel, and anti-materiel munitions.
The submunitions themselves may also be multi-purpose, such as combining a shaped charge, to attack armour, with a fragmenting case, to attack infantry, material, and light vehicles.
Modern multipurpose munitions may also have an incendiary effect.
Recently submunition-based weapons have been designed that deploy smart submunitions, using thermal and visual sensors to locate and attack particular targets, usually armored vehicles.
Weapons of this type include the US CBU-97 sensor-fuzed weapon, first used in combat during Operation Iraqi Freedom, the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
Munitions specifically intended for anti-tank use may be set to self-destruct if they reach the ground without locating a target, theoretically reducing the risk of unintended civilian deaths and injuries.
Although smart submunition weapons are many times more expensive than standard cluster bombs, which are cheaper and simpler to manufacture, far fewer smart submunitions are required for defeating dispersed and mobile targets in an area, offsetting this cost.
On the basis that they should not cause the indiscriminate area effects or unexploded ordnance risks of cluster munitions, these submunitions are not classified as cluster munitions under the definition of the weapon enshrined in international law by the Convention on Cluster Munitions.
========,3,Incendiary.
Incendiary cluster bombs are intended to start fires, just as conventional incendiary bombs (also called firebombs).
They are specifically designed for this purpose, with submunitions of white phosphorus or napalm, and they often include anti-personnel and anti-tank submunitions to hamper firefighting efforts.
When used in cities they have often been preceded by the use of conventional explosive bombs to break open the roofs and walls of buildings to expose flammable contents to the incendiaries.
One of the earliest examples is the so-called Molotov bread basket first used by the Soviet Union in the Winter War of 1939-40.
This type of munition was extensively used by both sides in the strategic bombings of World War II.
Bombs of this type were used to start firestorms or conflagrations in cases such as the bombing of Dresden in World War II and the firebombing of Tokyo.
In some modern bombs, submunitions are used to deliver a highly combustible thermobaric aerosol, which is subsequently ignited, resulting in a high pressure explosion.
========,3,Anti-personnel.
Anti-personnel cluster bombs use explosive fragmentation to kill troops and destroy soft (unarmored) targets.
Along with incendiary cluster bombs, these were among the first forms of cluster bombs produced by Germany during World War II.
They were famously used during the Blitz with delay and booby-trap fusing to hamper firefighting and other damage-control efforts in the bombed areas.
They were also used with a contact fuze when attacking entrenchments.
These weapons were most widely used during the Vietnam War when many thousands of tons of submunitions were dropped on Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.
========,3,Anti-tank.
Most anti-armor munitions contain shaped charge warheads to pierce the armor of tanks and armored fighting vehicles.
In some cases, guidance is used to increase the likelihood of successfully hitting a vehicle.
Modern guided submunitions, such as those found in the U.S. CBU-97, can use either a shaped charge or an explosively formed penetrator.
Unguided shaped-charge submunitions are designed to be effective against entrenchments that incorporate overhead cover.
To simplify supply and increase battlefield effectiveness by allowing a single type of round to be used against nearly any target, submunitions that incorporate both fragmentation and shaped-charge effects are produced.
========,3,Mine-laying.
When submunition-based weapons are used to disperse mines, their submunitions do not detonate immediately, but behave like conventional land mines that detonate later.
The submunitions usually include a combination of anti-personnel and anti-tank mines.
Since such mines usually lie on exposed surfaces, the anti-personnel forms, such as the US Area Denial Artillery Munition normally deploy tripwires automatically after landing to make clearing the minefield more difficult.
In order to avoid rendering large portions of the battlefield permanently impassable, and to minimize the amount of mine-clearing needed after a conflict, scatterable mines used by the United States are designed to self-destruct after a period of time from 4 to 48 hours.
The internationally agreed definition of cluster munitions being negotiated in the Oslo Process may not include this type of weapon, since landmines are already covered in other specific international instruments.
========,3,Chemical weapons.
During the 1950s and 1960s, the United States and Soviet Union developed cluster weapons designed to deliver chemical weapons.
The Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993 banned their use.
Six nations declared themselves in possession of chemical weapons.
The US and Russia are in the process of destroying their stockpiles, although they have received extensions for the full destruction, not having completed the destruction of their chemical weapons stockpiles by 2007, as the Treaty had originally intended.
========,3,Anti-electrical.
An anti-electrical weapon, the CBU-94/B, was first used by the U.S. in the Kosovo War in 1999.
These consist of a TMD (Tactical Munitions Dispenser) filled with 202 BLU-114/B "Soft-Bomb" submunitions.
Each submunition contains a small explosive charge that disperses 147 reels of fine conductive fiber of either carbon or aluminum-coated glass.
Their purpose is to disrupt and damage electric power transmission systems by producing short circuits in high-voltage power lines and electrical substations.
On the first attack, these knocked out 70% of the electrical power supply in Serbia.
There are reports that it took 500 people 15 hours to get one transformer yard back on line after being hit with these weapons.
========,3,Leaflet dispensing.
The LBU-30 is designed for dropping large quantities of propaganda leaflets from aircraft.
Enclosing the leaflets within the bomblets ensures that the leaflets will fall on the intended area without being dispersed excessively by the wind.
The LBU-30 consists of SUU-30 dispensers that have been adapted to leaflet dispersal.
The dispensers are essentially recycled units from old bombs.
The LBU-30 was tested at Eglin Air Force Base in 2000, by an F-16 flying at .
========,2,History of use.
========,3,Vietnam War.
During the Vietnam War, the US used cluster bombs in air strikes against targets in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.
According to The Guardian, of the 260 million cluster bomblets that rained down on Laos between 1964 and 1973, particularly on Xieng Khouang province, 80 million failed to explode.
The GlobalPost reports that about 7,000 people have been injured or killed by explosives left from the Vietnam War era in the Vietnamese Quang Tri Province alone.
========,3,Western Sahara war, 1975 - 1991.
During the 16 years long conflict on the territory of Western Sahara the Royal Moroccan Army (RMA) dropped cluster bombs.
The RMA used both artillery-fired and air-dropped cluster munitions.
BLU-63, M42 and MK118 submunitions were used at multiple locations in Bir Lahlou, Tifarity, Mehaires, Mijek and Awganit.
More that 300 cluster strike areas have been recorded in MINURSO Mine Action Coordination Center database.
========,3,Lebanon, 1978, 1982 and 2006.
***LIST***.
During the Israeli-Lebanese conflict in 1982, Israel used cluster munitions, many of them American-made, on targets in southern Lebanon.
Israel also used cluster bombs in the 2006 Lebanon War.
========,3,Georgia, 2008.
***LIST***.
Georgia admitted using cluster bombs during the war, according to Human Rights Watch.
The Georgian army used LAR-160 multiple rocket launchers to fire MK4 LAR 160 type rockets (with M-85 bomblets) with a range of 45 kilometers the Georgian Minister of Defense (MoD) said.
========,3,Libya, 2011.
It was reported in April 2011 that Colonel Gaddafi's forces had used cluster bombs in the conflict between government forces and rebel forces trying to overthrow Gaddafi's government, during the battle of Misrata These reports were denied by the government, and the Secretary of State of the USA, Hillary Clinton said she was "not aware" of the specific use of cluster or other indiscriminate weapons in Misurata even though a "New York Times" investigation refuted those claims.
An ejection canister for a Type 314 A AV submunition, manufactured in France was found in Libya despite the fact that France is a party to the international convention that bans cluster munitions.
========,3,Syria, 2012.
During the Syrian uprising, a few videos of cluster bombs first appeared in 2011, but escalated in frequency near the end of 2012.
As Human Rights Watch reported on October 13, 2012, "Eliot Higgins, who blogs on military hardware and tactics used in Syria under the pseudonym "Brown Moses", compiled a list of the videos showing cluster munition remnants in Syria's various governorates."
The type of bombs have been reported to be RBK-250 cluster bombs with AO-1 SCH bomblets (of Soviet design).
Designed by the Soviet Union for use on tank and troop formations, PTAB-2.5M bomblets were used on civilian targets in Mare' in December, 2012 by the Syrian government.
========,3,South Sudan, 2013.
Cluster bombs remnants were discovered by a UN de-mining team in February 2014 on a section of road near the Jonglei state capital, Bor.
The strategic town was the scene of heavy fighting, changing hands several times during the South Sudanese Civil War, which erupted in the capital Juba on 15 December 2013 before spreading to other parts of the country.
According to the United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS), the site was contaminated with the remnants of up to eight cluster bombs and an unknown quantity of bomblets.
========,3,Yemen, 2015.
British-supplied and U.S.-supplied cluster bombs have been used by Saudi Arabian-led military coalition against Houthi militias in Yemen, as per report of rights group.
Saudi Arabia is not signatory to the Convention on Cluster Munitions.
========,2,Threat to civilians.
While all weapons are dangerous, cluster bombs pose a particular threat to civilians for two reasons: they have a wide area of effect, and they have consistently left behind a large number of unexploded bomblets.
The unexploded bomblets can remain dangerous for decades after the end of a conflict.
Cluster munitions are opposed by many individuals and hundreds of groups, such as the Red Cross, the Cluster Munition Coalition and the United Nations, because of the high number of civilians that have fallen victim to the weapon.
Since February 2005, Handicap International called for cluster munitions to be prohibited and collected hundreds of thousands of signatures to support its call.
98% of 13,306 recorded cluster munitions casualties that are registered with Handicap International are civilians, while 27% are children.
The area affected by a single cluster munition, known as its footprint, can be very large; a single unguided M26 MLRS rocket can effectively cover an area of 0.23Â km.
In US and most allied services, the M26 has been replaced by the M30 guided missile fired from the MLRS.
The M30 has greater range and accuracy but a smaller area of coverage.
It is worth noting that for reasons including both danger to civilians and changing tactical requirements, the non-cluster unitary warhead XM31 missile is, in many cases, replacing even the M30.
Because of the weapon's broad area of effect, they have often been documented as striking both civilian and military objects in the target area.
This characteristic of the weapon is particularly problematic for civilians when cluster munitions are used in or near populated areas and has been documented by research reports from groups such as Human Rights Watch, Landmine Action, Mines Action Canada and Handicap International.
In some cases, like the Zagreb rocket attack, civilians were deliberately targeted by such weapons.
========,3,Unexploded ordnance.
The other serious problem, also common to explosive weapons is unexploded ordnance (UXO) of cluster bomblets left behind after a strike.
These bomblets may be duds or in some cases the weapons are designed to detonate at a later stage.
In both cases, the surviving bomblets are live and can explode when handled, making them a serious threat to civilians and military personnel entering the area.
In effect, the UXOs can function like land mines.
Even though cluster bombs are designed to explode prior to or on impact, there are always some individual submunitions that do not explode on impact.
The US-made MLRS with M26 warhead and M77 submunitions are supposed to have a 5% dud rate but studies have shown that some have a much higher rate.
The rate in acceptance tests prior to the Gulf War for this type ranged from 2% to a high of 23% for rockets cooled to before testing.
The M483A1 DPICM artillery-delivered cluster bombs have a reported dud rate of 14%.
Given that each cluster bomb can contain hundreds of bomblets and be fired in volleys, even a small failure rate can lead each strike to leave behind hundreds or thousands of UXOs scattered randomly across the strike area.
For example, after the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict, UN experts have estimated that as many as one million unexploded bomblets may contaminate the hundreds of cluster munition strike sites in Lebanon.
In addition, some cluster bomblets, such as the BLU-97/B used in the CBU-87, are brightly colored to increase their visibility and warn off civilians.
However, the yellow color, coupled with their small and nonthreatening appearance, is attractive to young children who wrongly believe them to be toys.
This problem was exacerbated in the War in Afghanistan (2001âpresent), when US forces dropped humanitarian rations from airplanes with similar yellow-colored packaging as the BLU-97/B, yellow being the NATO standard colour for high explosive filler in air weapons.
The rations packaging was later changed first to blue and then to clear in the hope of avoiding such hazardous confusion.
The US military is developing new cluster bombs that it claims could have a much lower (less than 1%) dud rate.
Sensor-fused weapons that contain a limited number of submunitions that are capable of autonomously engaging armored targets may provide a viable, if costly, alternative to cluster munitions that will allow multiple target engagement with one shell or bomb while avoiding the civilian deaths and injuries consistently documented from the use of cluster munitions.
Certain such weapons may be allowed under the recently adopted Convention on Cluster Munitions, provided they do not have the indiscriminate area effects or pose the unexploded ordnance risks of cluster munitions.
In the 1980s the Spanish firm Esperanza y Cia developed a 120mm caliber mortar bomb which contained 21 anti-armor submunitions.
What made the 120mm "Espin" unique was the electrical impact fusing system which totally eliminated dangerous duds.
The system operates on a capacitor in each submunition which is charged by a wind generator in the nose of the projectile after being fired.
If for what ever reason the electrical fuse fails to function on impact, approximately 5 minutes later the capacitor bleeds out, therefore neutralizing the submunition's electronic fuse system.
Later a similar mortar round was offered in the 81mm caliber and equipped some Spanish Marine units.
On signing the Wellington Declaration on Cluster Munitions, Spain withdrew both the 81mm and 120mm "Espin" rounds from its military units.
========,2,International legislation.
Cluster bombs fall under the general rules of international humanitarian law, but were not specifically covered by any currently binding international legal instrument until the signature of the Convention on Cluster Munitions in December 2008.
This international treaty stemmed from an initiative by the Government of Norway known as the Oslo Process which was launched in February 2007 to prohibit cluster munitions.
More than 100 countries agreed to the text of the resulting Convention on Cluster Munitions in May 2008 which sets out a comprehensive ban on these weapons.
This treaty was signed by 94 states in Oslo on 3â4 December 2008.
The Oslo Process was launched largely in response to the failure of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) where five years of discussions failed to find an adequate response to these weapons.
The Cluster Munition Coalition (CMC) is campaigning for the widespread accession to and ratification of the Convention on Cluster Munitions.
A number of sections of the Protocol on explosive remnants of war (Protocol V to the 1980 Convention), 28 November 2003 occasionally address some of the problems associated with the use of cluster munitions, in particular Article 9, which mandates States Parties to "take generic preventive measures aimed at minimising the occurrence of explosive remnants of war".
In June 2006, Belgium was the first country to issue a ban on the use (carrying), transportation, export, stockpiling, trade and production of cluster munitions, and Austria followed suit on 2007-12-07.
There has been legislative activity on cluster munitions in several countries, including Austria, Australia, Denmark, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States.
In some of these countries, ongoing discussions concerning draft legislation banning cluster munitions, along the lines of the legislation adopted in Belgium and Austria will now turn to ratification of the global ban treaty.
Norway and Ireland have national legislation prohibiting cluster munitions and were able to deposit their instruments of ratification to the Convention on Cluster Munitions immediately after signing it in Oslo on 3 December 2008.
========,3,International treaties.
Other weapons, such as land mines, have been banned in many countries under specific legal instruments for several years, notably the Ottawa Treaty to ban land mines, and some of the Protocols in the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons that also help clearing the lands contaminated by left munitions after the end of conflicts and provides international assistance to the affected populations.
However, until the recent adoption of the Convention on Cluster Munitions in Dublin in May 2008 cluster bombs were not banned by any international treaty and were considered legitimate weapons by some governments.
To increase pressure for governments to come to an international treaty on November 13, 2003, the Cluster Munition Coalition (CMC) was established with the goal of addressing the impact of cluster munitions on civilians.
At the launch, organised by Pax Christi Netherlands, the then Minister of Foreign Affairs, the later Secretary General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, addressed the crowd of gathered government, NGO, and press representatives.
International governmental deliberations in the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons turned on the broader problem of explosive remnants of war, a problem to which cluster munitions have contributed in a significant way.
There were consistent calls from the Cluster Munition Coalition, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and a number of UN agencies, joined by approximately 30 governments, for international governmental negotiations to develop specific measures that would address the humanitarian problems cluster munitions pose.
This did not prove possible in the conventional multilateral forum.
After a reversal in the US position, in 2007 deliberations did begin on cluster munitions within the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.
There was a concerted effort led by the US to develop a new protocol to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, but this proposal was rejected by over 50 states, together with civil society, ICRC and UN agencies.
The discussions ended with no result in November 2011, leaving the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions as the single international standard on the weapons.
In February 2006, Belgium announced its decision to ban the weapon by law.
Then Norway announced a national moratorium in June and Austria announced its decision in July to work for an international instrument on the weapon.
The international controversy over the use and impact of cluster munitions during the war between Lebanon and Israel in July and August 2006 added weight to the global campaign for a ban treaty.
Against this background, a new flexible multilateral process similar to the process that led to the ban on anti-personnel land mines in 1997 (the Ottawa Treaty) began with an announcement in November 2006 in Geneva as well at the same time by the Government of Norway that it would convene an international meeting in early 2007 in Oslo to work towards a new treaty prohibiting cluster munitions.
49 governments attended the meeting in Oslo February 22â23, 2007 in order to reaffirm their commitment to a new international ban on the weapon.
During the meeting Austria announced an immediate moratorium on the use, production and transfer of cluster munitions until a new international treaty banning the weapons is in place.
A follow-up meeting in this process was held in Lima in May where around 70 states discussed the outline of a new treaty, Hungary became the latest country to announce a moratorium and Peru launched an initiative to make Latin America a cluster munition free zone.
In addition, the ICRC held an experts meeting on cluster munitions in April 2007 which helped clarify technical, legal, military and humanitarian aspects of the weapon with a view to developing an international response.
Further meetings took place in Vienna from 4â7 December 2007, and in Wellington from 18â22 February 2008 where a declaration in favor of negotiations on a draft convention was adopted by more than 80 countries.
In May 2008 after around 120 countries had subscribed to the Wellington Declaration and participated in the Dublin Diplomatic Conference from 19 to 30 May 2008.
At the end of this Conference, 107 countries agreed to adopt the Convention on Cluster Munitions, that bans cluster munitions and was opened for signature in Oslo on December 3â4, 2008 where it was signed by 94 countries.
In July 2008, United States Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates implemented a policy to eliminate by 2018 all cluster bombs that do not meet new safety standards.
In November 2008, ahead of the signing Conference in Oslo, the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on all European Union governments to sign and ratify the Convention.
On 16 February 2010 Burkina Faso became the 30th state to deposit its instrument of ratification for the Convention on Cluster Munitions.
This means that the number of States required for the Convention to enter into force had been reached.
The treaty's obligations became legally binding on the 30 ratifying States on 1 August 2010 and subsequently for other ratifying States.
========,3,Convention on Cluster Munitions.
Taking effect on August 1, 2010, the "Convention on Cluster Munitions" bans the stockpiling, use and transfer of virtually all existing cluster bombs and provides for the clearing up of unexploded munitions.
It had been signed by 108 countries, of which 38 had ratified it by the affected date, but many of the world's major military powers including the United States, Russia, Brazil and China are not signatories to the treaty.
========,3,United States policy towards cluster munitions.
In May 2008, then-Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs Stephen Mull stated that the U.S. military relies upon cluster munitions as an important part of their defense strategy.
U.S. arguments favoring the use of cluster munitions are that their use reduces the number of aircraft and artillery systems needed to support military operations and if they were eliminated, significantly more money would have to be spent on new weapons, ammunition, and logistical resources.
Also, militaries would need to increase their use of massed artillery and rocket barrages to get the same coverage, which would destroy or damage more key infrastructures.
The U.S. was initially against any CCW negotiations but dropped its opposition in June 2007.
Cluster munitions have been determined as needed for ensuring the country's national security interests, but measures are being taken to address humanitarian concerns of their use, as well as pursuing their original suggested alternative to a total ban of pursuing technological fixes to make the weapons no longer viable after the end of a conflict.
In July 2012, the U.S. fired at a target area with 36 Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) unitary warhead rockets.
Analysis indicates that the same effects could have been made by four cluster GMLRS rockets.
If cluster weapons cannot be used, the same operation would require using nine times as many rockets, cost nine times as much ($400,000 compared to $3.6 million), and take 40 times as long (30 seconds compared to 20 minutes) to execute.
The U.S. suspended operational use of cluster munitions in 2003, and the U.S. Army ceased procurement of GMLRS cluster rockets in December 2008 because of a submunition dud rate as high as 5 percent.
Pentagon policy is to have all cluster munitions used after 2018 to have a submunition unexploded ordnance rate of less than 1 percent.
To achieve this, the Army has undertaken the Alternative Warhead Program (AWP) to assess and recommend technologies to reduce or eliminate cluster munition failures, as some 80 percent of U.S. military cluster weapons reside in Army artillery stockpiles.
========,2,Countries that have used cluster munitions.
At least seventeen countries have used cluster munitions in recent history (since the creation of the United Nations).
Of these nations Colombia, Iraq, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom no longer have stocks of the munitions Countries that have subscribed to the Wellington Declaration, agreeing in principle to ban cluster bombs, are listed in bold.
In addition, at least three countries that no longer exist (the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Serb Republic of Krajina and Rhodesia) have used cluster bombs.
========,2,Countries that have produced cluster munitions.
At least 30 nations have produced cluster munitions in recent history (since the creation of the United Nations).
Many of these nations still have stocks of these munitions.
Most (but not all) of them are involved in recent wars or long unsolved international conflicts; however most of them did not use the munitions they produced.
Countries that have subscribed to the Wellington Declaration, agreeing in principle to ban cluster bombs, are listed in bold.
========,2,Countries that have stocks of cluster munitions.
As of November 2015, at least 61 countries have stockpiles of cluster munitions.
Countries listed in bold have subscribed to the Wellington Declaration, agreeing in principle that their stockpiles should be destroyed.
========,2,Countries that have ratified the Convention on Cluster Munitions.
The Convention on Cluster Munitions entered into force on 1 August 2010, six months after it was ratified by 30 states.
As of 1 October 2015, a total of 118 states have joined the Convention, as 98 States parties and 20 Signatories.

========,2,Financial institutions involved in the process of production of cluster munition.
According to BankTrack, an international network of NGOs specializing in control of financial institutions, many major banks and other financial corporations either directly financed, or provided financial services to companies producing cluster munition in 2005-2012.
Among other, BankTrack 2012 report names ABN AMRO, Bank of America, Bank of China, Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Barclays, BBVA, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Commerzbank AG, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, CrÃ©dit Agricole, Credit Suisse Group, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Industrial Bank of China, ING Group, JPMorgan Chase, Korea Development Bank, Lloyds TSB, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Scotland, Sberbank, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale, UBS, Wells Fargo.
Many of these financial companies are connected to such producers of cluster munitions as Alliant Techsystems, China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, Hanwha, Norinco, Singapore Technologies Engineering, Textron, and others.
According to Pax Christi, a Netherlands-based NGO, in 2009, around 137 financial institutions financed cluster munition production.
Out of 137 institutions, 63 were based in the US, another 18 in the EU (the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy etc.
), 16 were based in China, 4 in Singapore, 3 in each of: Canada, Japan, Taiwan, 2 in Switzerland, and 4 other countries had 1 financial institution involved.
