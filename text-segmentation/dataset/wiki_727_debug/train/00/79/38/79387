========,1,preface.
The Pioneer Football League (PFL) is a collegiate athletic conference which operates in the United States.
The conference participates in the NCAA's Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) as a football-only conference.
It has member schools that range from New York, North Carolina, and Florida in the east to California in the west.
It is headquartered in Saint Louis, Missouri, in the same complex that also contains the offices of the Missouri Valley Conference and Missouri Valley Football Conference.
Unlike most other Division I FCS conferences, the Pioneer League consists of institutions that choose not to award athletic scholarships ("grants-in-aid") to football players.
Most of the PFL's members are private schools.
Morehead State University is currently the only public school in the conference.
========,2,History.
========,3,Foundation.
Following an NCAA rule change passed in January 1991, which required Division I schools to conduct all sports at the Division I level by 1993, the conference was formed by charter members Butler University, the University of Dayton, Drake University, the University of Evansville, and Valparaiso University.
The University of San Diego joined in 1992, and the league played its first season in 1993.
The six original schools which played in the 1993 season had previously sponsored football at the Division I, Division II and Division III levels.
========,3,Membership changes.
Original contraction In 1997, the league reduced to five members when the University of Evansville downgraded football from Division I to club status; Evansville explored upgrading football back to Division I in 2007, but decided against it.
2001 expansion In 2001, the conference nearly doubled in size and was reorganized with the five pre-2001 members forming the North Division, and newcomers Austin Peay State University, Davidson College, Jacksonville University and Morehead State University forming the South Division.
The reorganization spawned a new championship system in which the best record holders from each division would play in a title game for the conference championship.
2005–2008 membership changes On April 8, 2005, Austin Peay announced its departure from the league effective after the 2005 season; Austin Peay returned to scholarship-granting competition in 2007 as a member of the Ohio Valley Conference in which it competes in other sports.
As a result, the conference reverted to round-robin play; the divisions and championship game were abolished.
On April 7, 2006, Campbell University announced the reinstatement of football effective in 2008, and on December 5, 2007, accepted an invitation to the PFL.
In February 2008, Marist College announced that it would join the PFL for the 2009 season, after the MAAC stopped sponsoring football.
Although Campbell moved in 2011 from the Atlantic Sun Conference to the Big South Conference, which sponsors football, it did not join the Big South in football and remains in the PFL.
2013 membership changes & automatic playoff berth On June 13, 2011, Mercer University and Stetson University were announced as league members (effective 2013) bringing membership to 12 schools.
In addition, as of 2013, the league has an automatic bid into the FCS division I playoffs.
Soon after its PFL membership was announced, Mercer accepted an invitation to join the Southern Conference (scholarship-granting) effective July 1, 2014.
During its one season in the league, Mercer set a Division I win-loss record for start-up programs; Mercer finished the 2013 season with an overall record of 10–2 including an undefeated 8–0 record at home, also a Division I record held jointly with Auburn University, which likewise went undefeated at home in 2013.
On July 1, 2014, Mercer University joined the Southern Conference for all sports, including football.
========,2,Member schools.
========,3,Current members.
Campbell University has competed in the Big South Conference in non-football sports since 2011; it will depart the PFL following the 2017 season in favor of full membership in the Big South.
Valparaiso will change its primary conference affiliation to the Missouri Valley Conference in July 2017.
The Crusaders will remain in Pioneer League football.
========,2,Rivalries.
Three in-state rivalries currently exist in the PFL.
Butler and Valparaiso first played in 1927, and had nine meetings prior to 1951.
That year, the two teams began playing every year, and in 2006 began playing for the Hoosier Helmet Trophy.
Butler currently leads 47–24.
The two schools had an all-sports rivalry as well when both were in the Horizon League together from 2007–2012.
Campbell and Davidson began their rivalry in 2008 when the Fighting Camels joined the PFL.
Campbell and Davidson are tied 4–4 all-time through the 2016 season.
Jacksonville and Stetson started their football rivalry in 2013, when Stetson began PFL play.
The schools were already rivals in other sports, both being members of the ASUN Conference.
Butler and Dayton also have a rivalry based on proximity to each other.
The teams have met every year since 1977 with the exception of 1991 and 1992.
Dayton leads 26–11–1.
========,2,Postseason games.
The Pioneer Football League has had alliances with the Gridiron Classic and the Sports Network Cup.
In addition, league members are allowed to accept at-large invitations to other college bowl games and teams are eligible to compete in the FCS playoffs, and holds an automatic qualifier.
Starting in 2013, the Pioneer League joined ten other FCS conferences (Big Sky, Southern, Southland, MEAC, NEC, CAA, Big South, MVFC, OVC, Patriot League) that receive an automatic bid to compete in the Division I Football Championship as the playoffs expand from 20 teams to 24.
The PFL is 0–2 in the playoffs to date.
In 2013 Butler was defeated in the first round 31–0 by Tennessee State, while in 2014 San Diego was routed by Montana 52–14.
The PFL was a participant in the NCAA Division I FCS Consensus Mid-Major Football National Championship, along with the Northeast Conference and Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference, two other conferences without automatic playoff bids.
The Consensus championship has since been discontinued; the NEC first earned an automatic postseason bid in 2010, while the MAAC no longer sponsors football.
