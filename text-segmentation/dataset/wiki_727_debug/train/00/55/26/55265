========,1,preface.
A road train or land train is a trucking vehicle of a type used in rural and remote areas of Australia, Canada, Mexico and the United States, to move freight efficiently.
The term "road train" is mainly used in Australia.
In the United States, the terms "triples", "turnpike doubles", and "Rocky Mountain doubles" are commonly used for longer combination vehicles (LCVs).
A road train has a relatively normal tractor unit, but instead of towing one trailer or semi-trailer, it pulls two or more of them.
========,2,History.
Early road trains consisted of traction engines pulling multiple wagons.
The first identified road trains operated into South Australia's Flinders Ranges from the Port Augusta area in the mid 19th century, according to Basil Fuller in his book, "The Ghan".
They displaced bullock teams for the carriage of minerals to port and were, in turn, superseded by railways.
During the Crimean war a traction engine was used to pull multiple open trucks.
By 1898 steam traction engine trains with up to four wagons were employed in military manoeuvres in England.
In 1900, John Fowler & Co. provided armoured road trains for use by the British forces in the Second Boer War.
Lord Kitchener stated that he had around 45 steam road trains at his disposal.
There is an earlier road train built by its inventor in the United Kingdom.
It is shown in the No.
320 (No.
12, February 23, 1907) edition of "The Auto" Title: The Renard Road Train, page 242.
In the 1930s/40s, the government of South Australia operated an AEC 8×8 military truck to transport freight and supplies into the Northern Territory, replacing the Afghan camel trains that had been trekking through the deserts since the late 19th century.
This truck pulled two or three Dyson four-axle self-tracking trailers.
At , the AEC was grossly underpowered by today's standards, and drivers and offsiders (a partner or assistant) routinely froze in winter and sweltered in summer due to the truck's open cab design and the position of the engine radiator, with its cooling fan, behind the seats.
Australian Kurt Johansson is recognised as the inventor of the modern road train.
After transporting stud bulls to an outback property, Johansson was challenged to build a truck to carry 100 head of cattle instead of the original load of 20.
Provided with financing of about 2000 pounds and inspired by the tracking abilities of the Government roadtrain, Johansson began construction.
Two years later his first road train was running.
Johansson's first road train consisted of a U.S. Army World War II surplus Diamond-T tank carrier, nicknamed "Bertha", and two home-built self-tracking trailers.
Both wheel sets on each trailer could steer, and therefore could negotiate the tight and narrow tracks and creek crossings that existed throughout Central Australia in the earlier part of the 20th century.
Freighter Trailers in Australia viewed this improved invention and went on to build self-tracking trailers for Kurt and other customers, and went on to become innovators in transport machinery for Australia.
This first example of the modern road train, along with the AEC Government Roadtrain, forms part of the huge collection at the National Road Transport Hall of Fame in Alice Springs, Northern Territory.
========,2,Usage.
========,3,Australia.
Australia has the largest and heaviest road-legal vehicles in the world, with some configurations topping out at close to .
The majority are between .
Double (two-trailer) road train combinations are allowed on some roads in most states of Australia, including specified approaches to the ports and industrial areas of Adelaide, South Australia and Perth, Western Australia.
A double road train should not be confused with a B-double, which is allowed access to most of the country and in all major cities.
In South Australia, B-triples up to and two-trailer road trains to are only permitted to travel on approved routes in the north and west of the state, including access to Adelaide's north-western suburban industrial and export areas such as Port Adelaide, Gillman and Outer Harbour via Salisbury Highway, Port Wakefield Road and Augusta Highway.
Triple (three-trailer) road trains operate in western New South Wales, western Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory, with the last three states also allowing AB-quads (B double with two additional trailers coupled behind).
In South Australia, road trains up to are only permitted on the Stuart Highway and Olympic Dam Highway in the Far North.
Darwin is the only capital city in the world where triples and quads are allowed to within of the central business district (CBD).
Tasmania and Victoria do not allow the operation of road trains on any of their roads.
Victoria had previously allowed double road trains to operate around Mildura for the vintage grape harvest.
Strict regulations regarding licensing, registration, weights, and experience apply to all operators of road trains throughout Australia.
Road trains are used for transporting all manner of materials: common examples are livestock, fuel, mineral ores, and general freight.
Their cost-effective transport has played a significant part in the economic development of remote areas; some communities are totally reliant on regular service.
The multiple dog-trailers are unhooked, the dollies removed and then connected individually to multiple trucks at "assembly" yards when the road train gets close to populated areas.
When the flat-top trailers of a road train need to be transported empty, it is common practice to stack them.
This is commonly referred to as "doubled-up" or "doubling-up".
See illustration.
Sometimes, if many trailers are required to be moved at one time, they will be triple-stacked, or "tripled-up".
Higher Mass Limits (HML) Schemes are now piloting in all jurisdictions in Australia, allowing trucks to carry additional weight.
========,3,Canada.
In Canada, road trains are more commonly referred to as Long Combination Vehicles (LCVs), Extended Length Vehicles (ELVs), or Energy Efficient Motor Vehicles (EEMVs).
Four types of LCV are permitted: turnpike doubles, triples, rocky mountain doubles, and queen city triples.
Turnpike doubles consist of a tractor unit pulling a semi-trailer (up to long).
An A-type or C-type converter is connected to the rear of the trailer, and carries a second trailer.
Alternatively, the lead trailer may have a hideaway fifth wheel, which enables direct coupling of the second trailer without a converter.
The total permissible length is .
Triples may be up to in length when using A or C converters, or in B-train configuration.
Rocky mountain doubles are limited to in overall length, but have the advantage of being legal on two-lane, undivided roads.
A, B, and C-train variants are used.
Other LCVs may only be used on divided highways.
Queen city triples consist of a tractor unit pulling one semi-trailer up to long and two shorter "pup" trailers up to long.
Queen city triples are only permitted between the cities of Saskatoon and Regina, Saskatchewan.
These are the longest combinations allowed in North America on public highways.
========,4,Western Canada.
British Columbia restricts LCV operation to the Coquihalla Highway (formerly a toll road) between Hope and Merritt, with the exception of B-doubles (mainly used for hauling wood chips).
Alberta allows LCV operation on most major highways.
The Queen Elizabeth II Highway between Calgary and Edmonton carries the majority of turnpike doubles and triples.
Theoretically, these vehicles could be used on Highway 16 as far west as Hinton and Highway 43 as far north as Valleyview, but they are rarely used on these routes.
LCV operation north and west of Edmonton is limited to rocky mountain doubles, since the road is undivided north of Valleyview.
The destination of most rocky mountain doubles is Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories.
The Northwest Territories allows LCVs of up to in length.
These vehicles are restricted to specific destinations in Hay River and Yellowknife.
LCVs do not operate north of Yellowknife.
Saskatchewan mostly restricts LCVs to divided highways.
The short undivided section of Highway 11 around the village of Chamberlain is exempt from this restriction.
========,4,Licensing of LCV drivers.
(Information restricted to Alberta and NWT.)
Prospective LCV drivers must have held a licence for legal length articulated vehicles for two years (five years in the North West Territories).
They may have no more than two moving offences recorded within three years and may not have any vehicle-related criminal code violations.
They are required to pass a PDIC (professional driver improvement course) every four years.
They are required to pull an LCV at least once a year in order to keep their LCV licence.
========,3,United States.
In the United States, trucks on public roads are limited to two trailers (two and a dolly to connect; the limit is end to end).
Some states allow three trailers, although triples are usually restricted to less populous states such as Idaho, Oregon, and Montana, plus the Ohio Turnpike and Indiana East-West Toll Road.
Triples are used for long-distance less-than-truckload freight hauling (in which case the trailers are shorter than a typical single-unit trailer) or resource hauling in the interior west (such as ore or aggregate).
Triples are sometimes marked with "LONG LOAD" banners both front and rear.
"Turnpike doubles"—tractors towing two full-length trailers—are allowed on the New York Thruway and Massachusetts Turnpike (Interstate 90), Florida's Turnpike, Kansas Turnpike (Kansas City - Wichita route) as well as the Ohio and Indiana toll roads.
The term "road train" is not commonly used in the United States; "turnpike train" has been used, generally in a pejorative sense.
========,3,Europe.
In Finland, Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, and some roads in Norway, trucks with trailers are allowed to be long.
Elsewhere in the European Union, the limit is (Norway ).
The trucks are of a cab-over-engine design.
These have a flat front and a high floor about above ground with the engine below.
The Scandinavian countries are less densely populated than the other EU countries; and distances, especially in Finland and Sweden, are long.
Until the late 1960s, vehicle length was unlimited, giving rise to long vehicles to handle goods cost effectively.
As traffic increased, lengths became more of a concern and they were limited, albeit at a more generous level than in the rest of Europe.
In the United Kingdom in 2009, a two-year desk study of Longer Heavier Vehicles (LHVs) including options up to 11-axle, long, combinations, ruled out all road train type vehicles for the foreseeable future.
In 2010, Sweden was performing tests on log hauling trucks, weighing up to and measuring and haulers for two 40 ft containers, measuring in total.
========,3,Mexico.
Mexico allows LCVs consisting of double trailers around in length.
They must display a sign reading "Precaucion: Doble Semi-remolque" (Caution: Double Semi Trailer) on the rear, indicating that a double-length trailer is in use.
Mexico does not place special road restrictions on LCVs other than those already in place for conventional tractor-trailers.
Recently, regulations for road trains have been stiffened, limiting cargo to 60 tons among the two trailers.
Truck drivers have felt strain due to this change because previously some commercial drivers received company incentives to accept overloading of their double trailers.
========,2,Trailer arrangements.
========,3,A-double.
Eleven-axle coal tipping sets carrying to Port Kembla, Australia are described as A-doubles.
The set depicted has a tare weight of 35.5 tonne and is capable of carrying 50 tonne of coal.
Note the shield at the front of the second trailer to direct tipped coal from the first trailer downwards.
========,3,B-double.
A B-double (B-train) consists of a prime mover towing a specialised lead trailer that has a fifth-wheel mounted on the rear towing another semi-trailer, resulting in two articulation points.
Around container ports in Australia there may also have what is known as a super B-double, i.e.
a B-double with a quad axle lead trailer capable of holding one 40-foot shipping container or two 20-foot shipping containers, and the rear trailer being capable of the same with either a tri or quad rear axle set.
However, because of their length and low accessibility into narrow streets, these vehicles are restricted in where they can go and are generally used for terminal-to-terminal work, i.e.
wharf to container holding park or wharf-to-wharf.
The rear axle on each trailer can also pivot slightly while turning to prevent scrubbing out the edges of the tyres due to the heavy loads placed on them.
========,3,B-triple.
Same as a B-double but with an additional lead trailer behind the prime mover.
These are run in most states of Australia where double road trains are allowed.
There is one exception to that rule: B-triples are operated in Victoria, but by one operator, under a strict permit and on a dedicated route, between the Ford plants at Geelong and Campbellfield.
Australia's National Transport Commission proposed a national framework for B-triple operations that includes basic vehicle specifications and operating conditions that the commission anticipates will replace the current state-by-state approach, which largely discourages the use of B-triples for interstate operation.
========,3,C-train.
A C-train is a semi-trailer attached to a fifth-wheel on a C-dolly.
The C-dolly is connected to the tractor or another trailer in front of it with two drawbars, thus eliminating the drawbar connection as an articulation point.
One of the axles on a C-dolly is self-steerable to prevent tire scrubbing.
C-dollies are not permitted in Australia, due to the lack of articulation.
========,2,Rules and regulations.
========,3,Interstate Road Transport registration.
In 1991, at a Special Premiers Conference, Australian heads of government signed an inter-governmental agreement to establish a national heavy vehicle registration, regulation and charging scheme, otherwise known as FIRS.
This registration scheme is known as the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme.
The requirements of the scheme were as follows:
If the vehicle was purchased to be used for interstate trade, no stamp duty was payable on the purchase price of the vehicle.
The vehicle had to be subjected to an annual inspection for roadworthy standards, which had to be passed before registration could be renewed.
With the registration identification; the first letter of the 6 digit identified the home state: W, Western Australia; S, South Australia; V, Victoria; N, New South Wales; Q, Queensland; T, Tasmania; A, Australian Capital Territory and C, Northern Territory.
Due to the 'eastern' and 'western' mass limits in Australia, two different categories of registration were enacted.
The second digit of the registration plate showed what mass limit was allowed for that vehicle.
If a vehicle had a 'V' as the second letter, its mass limits were in line with the eastern states mass limits, which were:
***LIST***.
If a vehicle had an "X" as the second letter, its mass limits were in line with the western states mass limits, which were:
***LIST***.
The second digit of the registration being a "T" designates a trailer.
One of the main criteria of the registration was that intrastate operation was not permitted.
The load had to come from one state and be delivered to another state or territory.
Many grain carriers were reported and prosecuted for cartage from the paddock to the silos.
If, though, they went to a port silo, they were given the benefit of the doubt, as that grain was more than likely going overseas.
========,3,Signage.
Australian road trains have horizontal signs front and back with high black uppercase letters on a reflective yellow background reading "ROAD TRAIN".
The sign(s) must have a black border and be at least long and high and be placed between and above the ground on the fore or rearmost surface of the unit.
In the case of B-triples in Western Australia, they are signed front and rear with "Road-Train" until they cross the WA/SA border where they are then signed with "Long Vehicle" in the front and rear.
Converter dollies must have a sign affixed horizontally to the rearmost point, complying to the same conditions, reading "LONG VEHICLE".
This is required for when a dolly is towed behind a trailer.
========,3,Operating weights.
Operational weights are based on axle group masses, as follows:
***LIST***.
Therefore, a B-double would weigh ( + + + ).
A double road train would have an operational weight (without concessions) of ( + + + + ).
A triple is + ( + ), giving an all up weight of .
Quads weigh in at .
Concessional weight additions ( per group) can see a quad end up weighing .
If a tri-drive prime mover is utilised, along with tri-axle dollies, weights can reach nearly .
========,3,Speed limits.
The Australian national heavy vehicle speed limit is , excepting:
***LIST***.
In western Canada, LCVs are restricted to , or the posted speed limit.
Trucks of legal length () may travel at , or the posted speed limit.
========,2,World's longest road trains.
Below is a list of longest road trains driven in the world.
Most of these had no practical use, as they were put together and driven across relatively short distances for the express purpose of record-breaking.
***LIST***.
