The 1952 Summer Olympics (; ), officially known as the Games of the XV Olympiad, were an international multi-sport event held in Helsinki, Finland, in 1952.
Helsinki had been earlier selected to host the 1940 Summer Olympics, which were cancelled due to World War II.
It is the northernmost city at which a summer Olympic Games have been held.
These were the first games to be held in a non-Indo-European language speaking country.
It was also the Olympic Games at which the most number of world records were broken until surpassed by the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.
The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Indonesia, Israel, Thailand, and Saarland made their Olympic debuts in Helsinki 1952.

Japan and Germany were both reinstated and permitted to send athletes after being banned for 1948 for their instigation of World War II.
