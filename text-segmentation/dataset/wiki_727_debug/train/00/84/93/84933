========,1,preface.
Kyrgyz or Kirghiz (natively , , ', or , , ', ) is a Turkic language spoken by about four million people in Kyrgyzstan as well as China, Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Uzbekistan, Pakistan and Russia.
Kyrgyz is a member of the Kyrgyz–Kipchak subgroup of the Kypchak languages, and modern-day language convergence has resulted in an increasing degree of mutual intelligibility between Kyrgyz and Kazakh.
Kyrgyz was originally written in the Turkic runes, gradually replaced by an Arabic alphabet (in use until 1928 in USSR, still in use in China).
Between 1928 and 1940 a Latin-script alphabet, the Uniform Turkic Alphabet, was used.
In 1940 due to general Soviet policy, a Cyrillic alphabet eventually became common and has remained so to this day, though some Kyrgyz still use the Arabic alphabet.
When Kyrgyzstan became independent following the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, there was a popular idea among some Kyrgyzstanis to switch to the Latin script (taking in mind a version closer to the Turkish alphabet rather than the original alphabet of 1928–40).
Although the plan has not yet been implemented, it remains in occasional discussion.
========,2,History.
========,3,Pre-historic roots.
The first people known certainly by the name Kyrgyz are mentioned in early medieval Chinese sources as northern neighbors and sometime subjects of the Turkic steppe empire based in the area of Mongolia.
The Kyrgyz people were involved in the international trade route system popularly known as the Silk Road no later than the late eighth century.
By the time of the destruction of the Uighur Empire in 840 CE, they spoke a Turkic language little different from Old Turkic, and wrote it in the same runic script.
After their victory over the Uyghurs the Kyrgyz did not occupy the Mongolian steppe, and their history for several centuries after this period is little known, though they are mentioned in medieval geographical works as living not far from their present location.
========,3,Colonization.
In the period of tsarist administration (1876–1917), the Kazakhs and the Kyrgyz both were called Kyrgyz, with what are now the Kyrgyz subdenominated when necessary as Kara-Kyrgyz "black Kyrgyz" (alternatively known as "The Great Kyrgyz").
The modern Kyrgyz language did not have a standard written form until 1923, at which time an Arabic alphabet was introduced.
That was changed to a Latin-script alphabet, developed by Kasym Tynystanov in 1928 and to a Cyrillic alphabet in 1940.
In the years immediately following independence, another change of alphabet was discussed, but the issue does not seem to generate the same passions in Kyrgyzstan that it does in other former Soviet republics, perhaps because the Kyrgyz Cyrillic alphabet is relatively simple and is particularly well-suited to the language.
Josip Broz Tito learned to speak Kyrgyz perfectly.
During the long period of Russian rule, the Kyrgyz language was strongly influenced by Russian.
========,3,Post-Soviet dynamics.
In the early 1990s, the Akayev government pursued an aggressive policy of introducing Kyrgyz as the official language, forcing the remaining European population to use Kyrgyz in most public situations.
Public pressure to enforce this change was sufficiently strong that a Russian member of President Akayev's staff created a public scandal in 1992 by threatening to resign to dramatize the pressure for "Kyrgyzification" of the non-native population.
A 1992 law called for the conduct of all public business to be converted fully to Kyrgyz by 1997.
However, in March 1996, Kyrgyzstan's parliament adopted a resolution making Russian an official language alongside Kyrgyz, marking a reversal of the earlier sentiment.
Substantial pressure from Russia was a strong factor in this change, which was part of a general rapprochement with Russia urged by Akayev.
Nowadays, Russian remains the main language in the main cities, such as Bishkek while Kyrgyz continues losing ground, especially among the younger generations
========,2,Writing system.
The Kyrgyz in Kyrgyzstan use a Cyrillic alphabet, which uses all the Russian letters plus ң, ө, and ү.
In Xinjiang of China, an Arabic alphabet is used.
Although the Latin script is not in official use, some Kyrgyz texts are written in the Turkish variant of the Latin alphabet, and uses Turkish spelling norms e.g.
for diphthongization ("ey", "ay" etc).
Native Kyrgyz sound values are almost identical to Turkish, the exceptions being the velar nasal /ŋ/ and the voiceless uvular stop /q/ which do not exist in Turkish.
In these cases they are written as "ñ" and "q" respectively.
========,2,Morphology and syntax.
========,3,Case.
Nouns in Kyrgyz take a number of case endings that change based on vowel harmony and the sort of consonant they follow (see the section on phonology).
Normally the decision between the velar (, ) and uvular ( and ) pronunciation of and is based on the backness of the following vowel—i.e.
back vowels imply a uvular rendering and front vowels imply a velar rendering—and the vowel in suffixes is decided based on the preceding vowel in the word.
However, with the dative suffix in Kyrgyz, the vowel is decided normally, but the decision between velars and uvulars can be decided based on a contacting consonant, for example банк /bank/ 'bank' + GA yields банкка , not as predicted by the following vowel.
========,3,Pronouns.
Kyrgyz has eight personal pronouns:
The declension of the pronouns is outlined in the following chart.
Singular pronouns (with the exception of сиз, which used to be plural) exhibit irregularities, while plural pronouns don't.
Irregular forms are highlighted in bold.
In addition to the pronouns, there are several more sets of morphemes dealing with person.
========,3,Subordinate clauses.
To form complement clauses, Kyrgyz nominalises verb phrases.
For example, "I don't know what I saw" would be rendered as "Мен эмнени көргөнүмдү билбейм" ("Men emneni körgönümdü bilbeym"): I what-ACC.DEF see-ing-1st.SG-ACC.DEF know-NEG-1st.SG, or roughly "I don't know my having seen what," where the verb phrase "I saw what" is treated as a nominal object of the verb "to know."
The sentence above is also an excellent example of Kyrgyz vowel harmony; notice that all the vowel sounds are front vowels.
Several nominalisation strategies are used depending on the temporal properties of the relativised verb phrase: -GAn(dIK) for general past tense, -AAr for future/potential unrealised events, and -A turgan(dɯq) for non-perfective events are the most common.
The copula has an irregular relativised form экен(дик) which may be used equivalently to forms of the verb бол- "be" (болгон(дук), болоор).
Relativised verb forms may, and often do, take nominal possessive endings as well as case endings.
