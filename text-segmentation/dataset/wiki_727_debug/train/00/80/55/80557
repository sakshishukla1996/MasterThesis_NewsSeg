========,1,preface.
Kern County is a county in the U.S. state of California.
As of the 2010 census, the population was 839,631.
Its county seat is Bakersfield.
Kern County comprises the Bakersfield, CA Metropolitan statistical area.
The county spans the southern end of the Central Valley.
Covering , it ranges west to the southern slope of the Coast Ranges, and east beyond the southern slope of the eastern Sierra Nevada into the Mojave Desert, at the city of Ridgecrest.
Its northernmost city is Delano and its southern reach expands just beyond Lebec to Grapevine and the northern tip of the parallel Antelope Valley.
The county's economy is heavily linked to agriculture and to petroleum extraction.
There is also a strong aviation, space, and military presence, such as Edwards Air Force Base, the China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station, and the Mojave Air and Space Port.
It is one of the fastest growing areas in the United States in terms of population growth, and suffers from significant water supply issues and poor air quality.
========,2,History.
========,3,Spanish era.
The area was claimed by the Spanish in 1769, and in 1772 Commander Don Pedro Fages became the first European to enter it, from the south by way of the Grapevine Canyon.
Kern County was the site of the Battle of San Emigdio, in March 1824, between the Chumash Indians of the Santa Barbara Mission who rebelled against the Mexican government's taking over mission property and ejecting the natives.
This battle with Mexican forces from Monterey under the command of Carlos Carrillo took place at the canyon where San Emigdio Creek flows down San Emigdio Mountain and the Blue Ridge south of Bakersfield near today's Highway 166.
It was a low-casualty encounter, with only four Indians killed, and no Mexicans; the surviving Indians were pacified and brought back to Santa Barbara in June 1824 after a pursuit and negotiation in which many were allowed to keep their arms for the return march over the mountains.
========,3,American era.
In the beginning, the area that became Kern County was dominated by mining in the mountains and in the desert.
In 1855 an attempt to form a county in the area was made when the California legislature took the southeastern territory of Tulare County on the west of the Sierra Nevada Mountains for Buena Vista County, but it was never officially organized prior to 1859, when the time of the enabling legislation ran out.
The south of Tulare County was later organized as Kern County in 1866, with additions from Los Angeles and San Bernardino Counties.
Its first county seat was in the mining town of Havilah, in the mountains between Bakersfield and Tehachapi.
The flatlands were considered inhospitable and impassable at the time due to swamps, lakes, tule reeds and diseases such as malaria.
This changed when settlers started draining lands for farming and constructing canals, most dug by hand by hired Chinese laborers.
Within 10 years the valley surpassed the mining areas as the economic center of the county, and the county seat was moved as a result from Havilah to Bakersfield in 1874.
The discovery well of the Kern River Oil Field was dug by hand in 1899.
Soon the towns of Oil City, Oil Center and Oildale came into existence.
========,4,Etymology.
The county derives its name from the Kern River, which was named for Edward Kern, cartographer for General John C. Frémont's 1845 expedition, which crossed Walker Pass.
The Kern River was originally named Rio Bravo de San Felipe by Father Francisco Garces when he explored the area in 1776.
========,4,Earthquakes.
Severe earthquakes have struck Kern County within historical times, including the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake.
On July 21, 1952, an earthquake occurred with the epicenter about south of Bakersfield.
It measured 7.3 on the moment magnitude scale and killed 12 people.
In addition to the deaths, it was responsible for hundreds of injuries and more than $60 million in property damage.
The main shock was felt over much of California and as far away as Phoenix, Arizona and Reno, Nevada.
The earthquake occurred on the White Wolf Fault and was the strongest to occur in California since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.
Tehachapi suffered the greatest damage and loss of life from the earthquake, though its effects were widely felt throughout central and southern California.
The event had a significant aftershock sequence that persisted into July and August with the strongest coming on August 22, an M5.8 event with a maximum perceived intensity of VIII (Severe) and resulted in two additional deaths and an additional $10 million in property damage.
Repercussions of the sequence of earthquakes were still being felt in the heavily damaged downtown area of Bakersfield well into the 1990s as city leaders attempted to improve safety of the surviving non-reinforced masonry buildings.
Following the event, a field survey was conducted along the fault zone with the goal of estimating the peak ground acceleration of the shock based on visually evaluating precarious rock formations and other indicators.
Ground disturbances that were created by the earthquakes were also surveyed, both in the valley and in the foothills, with both vertical and horizontal displacements present in the epicenter area.
The strong motion records that were acquired from the event were significant, and a reconnaissance report was recognized for its coverage of the event, and how it set a standard for those types of engineering or scientific papers.
========,4,Abuse trials.
Between 1983 and 1986, several ritual sex ring child abuse cases occurred in Kern County, resulting in numerous long prison sentences, all of which were overturned—some of them decades later, because the prosecutors had coerced false testimonies from the purported child victims.
The details of these false accusations are covered extensively in the 2008 documentary "Witch Hunt", narrated by Sean Penn.
========,4,Music and Film.

========,3,Petroleum.
========,4,Discovery and development.
Oil development began with the 1894 discovery of the Midway-Sunset Oil Field, now the third-largest in the United States, in the southwestern portion of Kern County near Maricopa.
Yet it was an 1899 discovery along the Kern River, today part of the giant Kern River Oil Field, that was the breakthrough in Kern's oil production.
Oil was refined here even before the establishment of the county.
The Buena Vista Petroleum Company was organized and incorporated in 1864.
Soon thereafter a refinery was built that operated until April 1867 when work ceased because of high freight charges.
It was in the Midway-Sunset Oil Field that well drillers brought about the 1910 Lakeview Gusher, the largest recorded oil strike in U.S. history.
The well spewed approximately nine million barrels for 18 months onto the adjacent terrain before workers finally were able to cap it.
Other big oil fields in southwestern Kern County discovered early in the 20th century include the Buena Vista, the South Belridge and the Cymric fields.
The latter is the fastest-growing field in California in terms of barrels produced per year.
Later large fields include the Kern River Oil Field, the fifth-largest in the U.S., the adjacent Kern Front Oil Field, the Mount Poso Oil Field in the lower foothills of the Sierra north-northeast of Bakersfield and the Fruitvale Oil Field, which underlies much of the city of Bakersfield, along and north of the Kern River.
On July 22, 2009, Occidental Petroleum announced it had discovered the equivalent of 150 million to 250 million barrels of oil in Kern County, which the company called the largest oil discovery in California in 35 years.
The find added about 10 percent to California's known reserves.
Occidental's Ray Irani said it is likely that more oil would be found in the areas outside the initial six wells that tapped the discovery.
Occidental has not revealed the exact location of the find, two-thirds of which is natural gas.
BNET, an industry web publication, said the find would add to the company's 708 million barrels of proven reserves in California.
========,4,Petroleum today.
The county today contributes more than three-quarters of all the oil produced onshore in California.
Some of the large oil fields in Kern County which are still active include:

========,3,Aviation and space.
Department of Defense facilities include Edwards Air Force Base and China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station.
As home to Edwards Air Force Base the Air Force's main flight test facility, Kern has been the site of many milestones, including the first supersonic flight and the first landing of the Space Shuttle.
The base has brought prosperity to the railroad towns of Mojave and Rosamond.
Kern County is also the home of the first inland spaceport in the United States, the Mojave Spaceport.
========,3,Air pollution.
Kern County suffers from severe air pollution.
Particulates cause poor visibility, especially in the winter.
Western Kern County lies in the San Joaquin Valley and the topography traps pollutants.
Although the topography is not as unfavorable in eastern Kern County, eastern Kern County is a non-attainment area for particulates.
========,2,Recreation.
Outdoor recreational activities include horseback riding, water skiing (Lake Isabella, Lake Buena Vista, Lake Ming, and private ski ranches).
