========,1,preface.
ISO 216 specifies international standard (ISO) paper sizes used in most countries in the world today, although not in Canada or the United States.
The standard defines the "A" and "B" series of paper sizes, including A4, the most commonly available size.
Two supplementary standards, ISO 217 and ISO 269, define related paper sizes; the ISO 269 "C" series is commonly listed alongside the A and B sizes.
All ISO 216, ISO 217 and ISO 269 paper sizes (except some envelopes) have the same aspect ratio, 1:, at least to within the rounding to whole numbers of millimetres.
This ratio has the unique property that when cut or folded in half widthwise, the halves also have the same aspect ratio.
Each ISO paper size is one half of the area of the next larger size.
========,2,C series.
The C series formats are geometric means between the B series and A series formats with the same number (e.g., C2 is the geometric mean between B2 and A2).
The width to height ratio is as in the A and B series.
The C series formats are used mainly for envelopes.
An A4 page will fit into a C4 envelope.
C series envelopes follow the same ratio principle as the A series pages.
For example, if an A4 page is folded in half so that it is A5 in size, it will fit into a C5 envelope (which will be the same size as a C4 envelope folded in half).
The lengths of ISO C series paper are therefore times those of A-series paper – i.e., about 9% larger.
A, B, and C paper fit together as part of a geometric progression, with ratio of successive side lengths of , though there is no size half-way between B"n" and A("n" − 1): A4, C4, B4, "D4", A3, …; there is such a D-series in the Swedish extensions to the system.
The exact millimetre measurement of the long side of C"n" is given by ***formula***.

The tolerances specified in the standard are:

These are related to comparison between series A, B and C.
========,2,Application.
The ISO 216 formats are organized around the ratio 1:; two sheets next to each other together have the same ratio, sideways.
In scaled photocopying, for example, two A4 sheets reduced to A5 size fit exactly onto one A4 sheet, and an A4 sheet in magnified size onto an A3 sheet; in each case, there is neither waste nor want.
The principal countries not generally using the ISO paper sizes are the United States and Canada, which use the Letter, Legal and Executive system.
Although they have also officially adopted the ISO 216 paper format, Mexico, Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, the Philippines, and Chile also use mostly U.S. paper sizes.
Rectangular sheets of paper with the ratio 1: are popular in paper folding, such as origami, where they are sometimes called "A4 rectangles" or "silver rectangles".
In other contexts, the term "silver rectangle" can also refer to a rectangle in the proportion 1:(1 + ), known as the silver ratio.
