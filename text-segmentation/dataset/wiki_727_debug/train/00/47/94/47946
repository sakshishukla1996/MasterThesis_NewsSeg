========,2,History.
========,3,Early history.
According to folklore, Bhopal was founded in 11th century by the Paramara king Bhoja, who ruled from his capital at Dhar.
This theory states that Bhopal was originally known as Bhojpal after a dam ("pal") constructed by the king's minister.
No archaeological evidence, inscriptions or historical texts support the claim about an earlier settlement founded by Bhoja at the same place, although the Bhojeshwar Temple ascribed to him exists at Bhojpur, which is 28 km from Bhopal.
An alternative theory says that the city is named after another king called Bhupala (or Bhupal).
In the early 18th century, Bhopal was a small village in the Gond kingdom.
The modern Bhopal city was established by Dost Mohammad Khan (1672–1728), a Pashtun soldier in the Mughal army.
After the death of the emperor Aurangzeb, Khan started providing mercenary services to local chieftains in the politically unstable Malwa region.
In 1709, he took on the lease of Berasia estate and later annexed several territories in the region to establish the Bhopal State.
Khan received the territory of Bhopal from the Gond queen Kamlapati in lieu of payment for mercenary services and usurped her kingdom after her death.
In the 1720s, he built the Fatehgarh fort in the village, which developed into the city of Bhopal over the next few decades.
========,3,Begum rule.
Bhopal became a princely state after signing a treaty with the British East India Company in 1818.
Between 1819 and 1926, the state was ruled by four women, Begums — unique in the royalty of those days — under British suzerainty.
Qudsia Begum was the first woman ruler (between 1819-1837), who was succeeded by her granddaughter, Shah Jehan.
Between the years 1844-1860, when Shah Jehan was a child, her mother Sikandar (only daughter of Qudsia) ruled as regent, and was then recognized as ruler in 1860.
She ruled until 1868, when Shah Jehan succeeded her and was Begum until 1901.
In 1901, Shah Jehan's daughter Kaikhusrau Jahan became Begum, ruled until 1926, and was the last of the female line of succession.
In 1926, she abdicated in favor of her son, Hamidullah Khan, who ruled until 1947, and was the last of the sovereign Nawab Begums.The rule of Begums gave the city its waterworks, railways, a postal system, and a municipality constituted in 1907.
========,3,Post independence.
Bhopal State was the second-largest Muslim-ruled princely state: the first being Hyderabad.
After the independence of India in 1947, the last Nawab expressed his wish to retain Bhopal as a separate unit.
Agitations against the Nawab broke out in December 1948, leading to the arrest of prominent leaders including Shankar Dayal Sharma.
Later, the political detainees were released, and the Nawab signed the agreement for Bhopal's merger with the Union of India on 30 April 1949.
The Bhopal state was taken over by the Union Government of India on 1 June 1949.
========,3,Bhopal disaster.
On December 1984, a Union Carbide India Limited pesticide plant in Bhopal leaked around 32 tons of toxic gases, including methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas which led to the worst industrial disaster to date.
The official death toll was initially recorded around 4,000.
A Madhya Pradesh government report stated 3,787 deaths, while other estimates state the fatalities were significantly higher (16,000) from the accident and the medical complications caused by the accident in the weeks and years that followed.
The higher estimates have been challenged.
The impact of the disaster continues to this day in terms of psychological and neurological disabilities, blindness, skin, vision, breathing, and birth disorders.
The soil and ground water near the factory site have been contaminated by the toxic wastes.
The Bhopal disaster continues to be the part of the socio-political debate; the clean-up of environmental contamination and rehabilitation of those affected continues to challenge the people of Bhopal.
December 3rd is annually observed as the official day of mourning, and every year, all government offices in Bhopal are closed.
