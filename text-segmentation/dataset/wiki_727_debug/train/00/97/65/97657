Webster Parish (French: "Paroisse de Webster") is a parish located in the northwestern section of the U.S. state of Louisiana.
The seat of the parish is Minden.
As of the 2010 census, the Webster Parish population was 41,207.
In 2017, the population estimate was 39,710, a decline of nearly 3.8 percent since the 2011 estimated count of  41,259.
The decline represents an average loss of 258 persons per year.
Public officials who have long sought to increase the industrial potential of the parish, expressed concern over the downward spiral.
Jim Bonsall, the president of the Webster Parish Police Jury, the parish governing body, cited the ending of the Haynesville Shale boom as the primary reason for the population losses.
The parish has long depended on jobs in the petroleum and natural gas fields.
The parish is named for 19th-century American statesman Daniel Webster of Massachusetts and New Hampshire.
It was created on February 27, 1871 from lands formerly belonging to Bienville, Bossier, and Claiborne parishes.
The parish centennial celebration was held in May 1971.
Speakers included Police jury president Leland Garland Mims and Judge Enos McClendon of the Louisiana 26th Judicial District Court, who gave a biographical sketch of Daniel Webster.
Many officials and parish employees dressed in period costume of the 1870s for the event.
Webster Parish is part of the Shreveport-Bossier City, LA Metropolitan Statistical Area.
Among the first settlers in Webster Parish was Newett Drew, a native of Virginia, who about 1818 established a grist mill at the former Overton community near Minden.
At this time the area was Natchitoches Parish and later Overton became the Parish Seat of Claiborne Parish in 1836 until it moved in 1848.
His son, Richard Maxwell Drew was born in Overton and served as a district judge state representative prior to his death in 1850 at the age of twenty-eight.
R. M. Drew's descendants held judicial or legislative positions in Webster Parish as well, Richard Cleveland Drew, Harmon Caldwell Drew, R. Harmon Drew, Sr., and Harmon Drew, Jr.
========,2,Law, government, and politics.
The existing Webster Parish Court House in Minden, built at a cost of $876,000, was dedicated on May 1, 1953, with Governor Robert F. Kennon, who was reared in Minden and formerly served as its mayor, as the featured speaker.
Planning on the courthouse began in 1950, when it was determined that the previous structure had become obsolete.
At the time of its establishment in 1904, the previous courthouse, built at a cost of $45,000, was said to have "rivaled any other in north Louisiana for its graceful, domed architectural style and marbled hallways."
A modern multi-level jail was added to that courthouse in 1906 at a cost of $16,000.
The new jail enabled constituents coming to the sheriff's tax office to avoid passing through the jail.
When Webster Parish was carved from Claiborne Parish in 1871, the state representative was John Sidney Killen, a native of Darlington County, South Carolina, who beginning in 1849 operated a farm and cattle spread north of Minden.
He was the great-grandfather of a later mayor of Minden, Floyd D. Culbertson, Jr., who served from 1940 to 1942, and the father-in-law of Webster Parish pioneer William G. Stewart, a farmer and president of the Webster Parish School Board, for whom the former William G. Stewart Elementary School was named.
W. W. Carloss, who fought in the Siege of Port Hudson, was the Webster Parish state representative from 1874 to 1888, but he thereafter moved to Lafayette County in southwestern Arkansas.
From 1896 to 1900, Thomas Wafer Fuller of Minden, a descendant of a prominent area family, served as the state senator freom Webster and the surrounding parishes of Bossier and Bienville.
He was also a newspaper publisher, twice the owner of the former "Webster Signal".
From 1908 until his death in 1920, he was the second school superintendent in Webster Parish.
Leland G. Mims, a Minden businessman, served as a Webster Parish police juror (the parish governing body) from 1953–1976, president of the jury each year from 1956–1973, and president of the Police Jury Association of Louisiana from 1965-1967.
Mims' father-in-law, W. Matt Lowe, served on the police jury between 1940 and 1954 and was the mayor of Minden from 1916 to 1920.
From 1992 to 2012, Webster Parish was represented in the Louisiana House of Representatives by a member of the Doerge family.
Democrat Everett Doerge, a retired educator and native of Minden, unseated the short-term Republican incumbent Eugene Eason and held the seat until his death in 1998.
His widow, Jean M. Doerge, also a former educator, a Democrat, and a native of Natchitoches Parish, won the special election as his successor.
She was reelected three times, twice without opposition but was term-limited in 2011.
The Webster Parish representative effective in 2012 is Democrat Harlie Eugene Reynolds, a retired educator from Dubberly.
In 1996, the Webster Parish Police Jury approved a $1,849,000 bid to the firm Finney Co. of Shreveport for construction of a new parish library facility on Est and West Street in Minden.
Webster Parish is generally competitive in most contested elections.
The parish voted for Republican Barry Goldwater for president in 1964 and George Wallace in 1968, when the former governor of Alabama ran on the American Independent Party ticket.
