Washington Parish (French: "Paroisse de Washington") is a parish located in the U.S. state of Louisiana.

========,2,History.
Washington Parish was formed in 1819 by splitting off from St. Tammany Parish.
Franklinton became the parish seat on February 10, 1821.
Washington Parish is the most northeasterly of what are called the "Florida Parishes".
Great Britain took over control of French territory east of the Mississippi River in 1763 after defeating France in the Seven Years' War.
But France had ceded some territory to Spain.
This area was under contention, and English and American settlers tried to set up an independent state in 1810.
The United States annexed it, later settling with Spain in a treaty.
Through much of this period, the French influence remained strong in the region, especially in its former colonial cities.
This area was rural and forested with virgin longleaf pine ("Pinus palustris" L.) In the early 20th century, entrepreneurial brothers Frank and Charles W. Goodyear, already successful businessmen from Buffalo, New York]], purchased hundreds of thousands of acres of forest in this area and in southwestern Mississippi.
They established the Great Southern Lumber Company, constructed a huge sawmill (the largest in the world at the time in the middle of the forest, and developed Bogalusa, Louisiana, as a company town.
It had housing for workers (with sections for Americans and another for "colored" and foreign workers) and supervisors, several hotels, churches, a YMCA and YWCA, schools, and other services in a year, opening facilities in 1907.
To access the timber and transport processed lumber from the mill to markets, they built the New Orleans Great Northern Railroad, connecting Bogalusa to the port.
Before World War II, the virgin forest was harvested, and the sawmill run by Great Southern Lumber Company closed in 1938.
The paper mill and chemical operations continued.
Gradually in the late 20th century, these operations declined; as jobs left, the population dropped in such industrial towns.
Some people moved to new or emerging industries in New Orleans and other major cities.

========,2,Economy.
Washington Parish is currently known for its agriculture, particularly watermelons.
Through much of the 20th century, its economy was based on its timber and paper industry.
In 1906, The Great Southern Lumber Company, founded by the Goodyear brothers from New York, purchased huge tracts of forest and established a sawmill in Bogalusa to harvest the local virgin pine forests.
This company was the first to introduce reforestation in order to sustain the timber industry locally.
Taken over by Crown Zellerbach, it later started a paper mill and chemical businesses in the area.
The local business passed through several hands as the lumber and related industries restructured through the late 20th century.
In the 21st century, Temple-Inland Corporation is the largest employer in the parish.
