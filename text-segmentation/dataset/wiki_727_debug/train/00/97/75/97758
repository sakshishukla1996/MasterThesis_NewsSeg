========,1,preface.
Doctor Zhivago (Italian: "Il dottor Zivago") is a 1965 British-Italian epic romantic drama film directed by David Lean.
It is set in Russia between the years prior to World War I and the Russian Civil War of 1917–1922, and is based on the Boris Pasternak novel of the same name.
While immensely popular in the West, the book was banned in the Soviet Union for decades.
For this reason, the film could not be made in the Soviet Union and was instead filmed mostly in Spain.
The film stars Omar Sharif in the title role as Yuri Zhivago, a married physician whose life is irreversibly altered by the Russian Revolution and subsequent Civil War, and Julie Christie as his, also married, love interest Lara Antipova.
The supporting cast includes Geraldine Chaplin, Rod Steiger, Alec Guinness, Tom Courtenay, Ralph Richardson, Siobhán McKenna and Rita Tushingham.
Contemporary critics were generally disappointed, complaining of its length at over three hours, and claiming that it trivialized history, but acknowledging the intensity of the love story and the film's treatment of human themes.
Over time, however, the film's reputation has improved greatly.
At the 38th Academy Awards, "Doctor Zhivago" won five Oscars: Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design; it was nominated for five others (including Best Picture and Best Director), but lost four of these five to "The Sound of Music".
It also won five awards at the 23rd Golden Globe Awards including Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama for Sharif.
As of 2016, it is the eighth highest-grossing film of all time in the United States and Canada, adjusted for ticket-price inflation.
It was ranked by the American Film Institute in 1998 as the 39th greatest film on their 100 Years..100 Movies list, and by the British Film Institute the following year as the 27th greatest British film of all time.
========,2,Plot.
***LIST***.
The film takes place mostly against a backdrop of the pre-World War I years, World War I itself, the Russian Revolution of 1917, and the Russian Civil War.
A narrative framing device, set in the late 1940s or early 1950s, involves KGB Lieutenant General Yevgraf Andreyevich Zhivago (Alec Guinness) searching for the daughter of his half brother, Doctor Yuri Andreyevich Zhivago (Omar Sharif), and Larissa ("Lara") Antipova (Julie Christie).
Yevgraf believes a young woman, Tanya Komarova (Rita Tushingham), may be his niece and tells her the story of her father's life.

While the train is stopped early one morning, Zhivago wanders away.
He stumbles across the armoured train of Strelnikov sitting on a hidden siding.
Yuri is summoned before Strelnikov, whom he recognizes as the former Pasha Antipov.
During a tense interview, Strelnikov informs Yuri that his estranged wife Lara is now living in the town of Yuriatin, then occupied by the anti-Communist White Army forces.
He permits Zhivago to return to his family, although it is hinted by Strelnikov's right-hand man that most people interrogated by Strelnikov end up being shot.
========,2,Production.
========,3,Background.
Boris Pasternak's 1957 novel was published in the West amidst celebration and controversy.
Parts of Pasternak's book had been known in Samizdat since some time after World War II.
However, the novel was not completed until 1956.
The book had to be smuggled out of the Soviet Union by an Italian called D'angelo to whom Pasternak had entrusted the book to be delivered to Giangiacomo Feltrinelli, a left-wing Italian publisher who published it shortly thereafter.
Helped by a Soviet campaign against the novel, it became a sensation throughout the non-communist world.
It spent 26 weeks atop the "New York Times" best-seller list.
A great lyric poet, Pasternak was awarded the 1958 Nobel Prize for Literature.
While the citation noted his poetry, it was understood that the prize was mainly for "Doctor Zhivago", which the Soviet government saw as an anti-Soviet work, thus interpreting the award of the Nobel Prize as a gesture hostile to the Soviet Union.
A target of the Soviet government's fervent campaign to label him a traitor, Pasternak felt compelled to refuse the Prize.
The situation became an international "cause célèbre" and made Pasternak a Cold War symbol of resistance to Soviet communism.
========,3,Development and casting.
The film treatment by David Lean was proposed for various reasons.
Pasternak's novel had been an international success, and producer Carlo Ponti was interested in adapting it as a vehicle for his wife, Sophia Loren.
Lean, coming off the huge success of "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962), wanted to make a more intimate, romantic film to balance the action- and adventure-oriented tone of his previous film.
One of the first actors signed onboard was Omar Sharif, who had played Lawrence's right-hand man Sherif Ali in "Lawrence of Arabia".
Sharif loved the novel, and when he heard Lean was making a film adaptation, he requested to be cast in the role of Pasha (which ultimately went to Tom Courtenay).
Sharif was quite surprised when Lean suggested that he play Zhivago himself.
Peter O'Toole, star of "Lawrence of Arabia", was Lean's original choice for Zhivago, but turned the part down; Max von Sydow and Paul Newman were also considered.
Michael Caine tells in his autobiography that he also read for Zhivago and participated in the screen shots with Christie, but (after watching the results with David Lean) was the one who suggested Omar Sharif.
Rod Steiger was cast as Komarovsky after Marlon Brando and James Mason turned the part down.
Audrey Hepburn was considered for Tonya, while Robert Bolt lobbied for Albert Finney to play Pasha.
Lean was able to convince Ponti that Loren was not right for the role of Lara, saying she was "too tall" (and confiding in screenwriter Robert Bolt that he could not accept Loren as a virgin for the early parts of the film), and Yvette Mimieux, Sarah Miles and Jane Fonda were considered for the role.
Ultimately, Julie Christie was cast based on her appearance in "Billy Liar" (1963), and the recommendation of John Ford, who directed her in "Young Cassidy" (1965).
Sharif's son Tarek was cast as the young Zhivago in the film and Sharif directed his son as a way to get closer to his character.
========,3,Filming.
 Because the book was banned in the Soviet Union, it could not be filmed there.
Lean's experience filming a part of Lawrence of Arabia in Spain, access to CEA studios, and the guarantee of snow in some parts of Spain led to his choosing the country as the primary location for filming.
However, the weather predictions failed and David Lean's team found the warmest winter in Spain in 50 years.
As a result, some scenes were filmed in interiors with artificial snow made with dust from a nearby marble quarry.
The team filmed some locations with heavy snow, such as the snowy landscape in Strelnikov's train sequence, somewhere in Campo de Gómara near Soria.
The film was shot over ten months, with the entire Moscow set being built from scratch outside Madrid.
Most of the scenes covering Zhivago's and Lara's service in World War I were filmed in Soria, as was the Varykino estate.
The "ice-palace" at Varykino was filmed in Soria as well, a house filled with frozen beeswax.
The charge of the partisans across the frozen lake was filmed in Spain, too; a cast iron sheet was placed over a dried river-bed, and fake snow (mostly marble dust) was added on top.
Some of the winter scenes were filmed in summer with warm temperatures, sometimes of up to 25 °C (77 °F).
Other locations include the "Estación de Madrid-Delicias" in Madrid and "El Moncayo".
The initial and final scenes were shot at the Aldeadávila Dam between Spain and Portugal.
Although uncredited, most of those scenes were actually shot on the Portuguese side of the river, overlooking the Spanish side.
Other winter sequences, mostly landscape scenes and Yuri's escape from the partisans, were filmed in Finland.
Winter scenes of the family traveling to Yuriatin by rail were filmed in Canada.
The locomotives seen in the film are Spanish locomotives like the RENFE Class 240 (ex-1400 MZA), and Strelnikov's armoured train is towed by the RENFE Class 141F Mikado locomotive.
One train scene became notorious for the supposed fate that befell , a Hungarian actress, who slipped clambering onto a moving train.
Although she fell under the wagon, she returned to work within three weeks (and did not perish or lose a limb).
Lean appears to have used part of her accident in the film's final cut.
Nicolas Roeg was the original Director of Photography and worked on some scenes, but after an argument with Lean, left and was replaced by Freddie Young.
========,2,Release.
Released theatrically on 22 December 1965, the film went on to gross $111.7 million in the United States and Canada across all of its releases and is the eighth highest-grossing film of all time adjusted for inflation.
The film was also entered into the 1966 Cannes Film Festival.
In 2002 Warner Bros. released the 35th Anniversary version of "Doctor Zhivago" on DVD (two-disc set), and another Anniversary Edition in 2010 on Blu-ray (a three-disc set that includes a book).
========,3,Critical reception.
Upon its initial release, "Doctor Zhivago" was criticized for its romanticization of the revolution.
Bosley Crowther of the "New York Times" felt that the film's focus on the love story between Zhivago and Lara trivialized the events of the Russian Revolution and the resulting civil war, but was impressed by the film's visuals.
Also critical of the film was "The Guardian"'s Richard Roud, who wrote: "In the film the revolution is reduced to a series of rather annoying occurrences; getting firewood, finding a seat on a train, and a lot of nasty proles being tiresome.
Whatever one thinks of the Russian Revolution it was certainly more than a series of consumer problems.
At least it was to Zhivago himself.
The whole point of the book was that even though Zhivago disapproved of the course the revolution took, he had approved of it in principle.
Had he not, there would have been no tragedy".
In a positive review, Time Magazine called the film "Literate, old-fashioned, soul-filling and thoroughly romantic".
Reviewing it for its 30th anniversary, film critic Roger Ebert regarded it as "an example of superb old-style craftsmanship at the service of a soppy romantic vision", and wrote that "the story, especially as it has been simplified by Lean and his screenwriter, Robert Bolt, seems political in the same sense "Gone With the Wind" is political, as spectacle and backdrop, without ideology", concluding that the political content is treated mostly as a "sideshow".
Geoffrey Macnab of "The Independent" reviewed the film for its 50th anniversary and noted director David Lean's "extraordinary artistry" but found the film bordering on "kitsch".
Macnab also felt that the musical score by Maurice Jarre still stood up but criticised the English accents.
