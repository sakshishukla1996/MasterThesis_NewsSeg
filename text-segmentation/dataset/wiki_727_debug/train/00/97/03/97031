========,2,History.
In the late years of the western Roman empire, a small town called Otmus was settled on a site where the Soissons-Troyes road crossed the Marne river.
During the 8th century, Charles Martel kept king Theuderic IV prisoner in the castle of Otmus.
At this time, the town took the name of Castrum Theodorici, later transformed in Château-Thierry ("Castle of Thierry", Thierry is the French or early Roman language translation of Theuderic).
In 946, the castle of Château-Thierry was the home of Herbert le-Vieux, Count of Omois (Fr: "comte d'Omois") of the House of Vermandois & Soissons.
Château-Thierry was the site of two important battles.
The Battle of Château-Thierry (1814) in the Napoleonic Wars between France and Prussia, and Battle of Château-Thierry (1918) in World War I, between the United States and Germany.
In 1918, a mounting for the infamous Paris Gun was found near the castle, though the cannon itself had apparently been moved prior to the emplacement's discovery.
