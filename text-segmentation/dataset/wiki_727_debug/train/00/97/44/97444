Phillips County is a county located in the eastern part of the U.S. state of Arkansas, in what is known as the Arkansas Delta along the Mississippi River.
As of the 2010 census, the population was 21,757.
The county seat is Helena-West Helena.
Phillips County is Arkansas's seventh county, formed on May 1, 1820, and named for Sylvanus Phillips, the area's first-known white settler and representative to the first Territorial Legislature of the Arkansas Territory.
This lowland area was developed for cotton plantations in the antebellum area and is still largely rural.
The Helena-West Helena, AR Micropolitan Statistical Area includes all of Phillips County.
In 1919 during the Elaine race riot in Phillips County, 237 African Americans were killed, attacked by armed whites trying to suppress the Progressive Farmers and Household Union of America which was organizing in the county.
Because of the white mob action, the deaths were classified as lynchings by the Equal Justice Institute in its 2015 report.
Phillips County thus ranks as the county with the highest number of lynchings in U.S. history.
