========,3,Civil War and Reconstruction.
A large Democratic majority was ardently split into a "town or country" dichotomy at the local level.
Further, the county was split between Union and Confederate sympathizers, with deep grudges being held by both sides for grievances committed during the opposite's rule during the war.
After the war, Republicans controlled local government and the Democrats controlled the county economy.
The political situation and cultural differences kept tensions high between the groups, occasionally resulting in violence.
The most violent episode came to be known as the Pope County Militia War, a six-month drama involving robbery, plundering and murder.
