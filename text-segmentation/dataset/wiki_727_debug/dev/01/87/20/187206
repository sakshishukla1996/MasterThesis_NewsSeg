========,1,preface.
Stanley is a town and a tourist attraction in Hong Kong.
It is located on a peninsula on Hong Kong Island.
It is east of Repulse Bay and west of Shek O, adjacent to Chung Hom Kok.
Administratively, it is part of the Southern District.
The Chinese name "Chek Chue" refers to the original village-town but "Stanley" generally refers to all the surrounding areas of the peninsula.
========,2,Name.
There are two possible origins of the name "Chek Chue".
Legend has it that the notorious pirate Cheung Po Tsai was active in Stanley.
That is why the district became known in Cantonese as Chak Chue ().
There was once a Cheung Po Tsai Cave near the Tin Hau Temple west of Stanley, but the cave was filled in the early 1950s.
The original Cantonese name of the village was believed to be based on a big tall cotton tree ("Bombax malabaricum", "Bombax ceiba" ) often covered with bright red blossoms at the time, hence red pillar () in Hakka language.
It was given an English name after Lord Stanley (subsequently Earl of Derby), British Colonial Secretary at the time of the cession of Hong Kong to the United Kingdom, and subsequently Prime Minister.
========,2,History.
After the annexation of Hong Kong in 1842, the British made Stanley the temporary administrative centre, before moving it to the newly founded Victoria City (present day Central) on Hong Kong Island.
Stanley Fort was where British and Canadian troops mounted a last stand during the Battle of Hong Kong.
The survivors surrendered to Japanese forces in December 1941.
The fort, which was the former British Army barracks in Stanley, is now occupied by the People's Liberation Army following the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China in 1997.

========,3,Stanley Market and Pat Kan Uk.
Stanley Market is situated in Stanley New Street near the Stanley food market.
It is an array of small shops and street stalls.
Pat Kan Uk is a row of eight houses.
Many people think they are abandoned pre-war buildings but each of them is still a home to local elders.
There were eight houses belonging to farming families in Wong Ma Kok before the Sino-Japanese War.
The government recovered the land to develop barracks and a terrace of eight houses was built here as relocation homes for the local residents.
========,3,Stanley Main Street.
Stanley has many bars and restaurants on its waterfront along Stanley Main Street.
To the west of Stanley Main Street, past the amphitheatre in Stanley Plaza is the Tin Hau Temple (Temple of the Queen of Heaven).
Built by Cheung Po Tsai in 1767, it is one of the oldest temples in Hong Kong.
========,3,Stanley Plaza.
Adjacent to Murray House and Lung Tak Court, Stanley Plaza opened in 2001.
It includes a shopping arcade and an outdoor community amphitheatre.
The complex is owned by The Link REIT.
Numerous free concerts and events are held in the amphitheatre throughout the year.
In November 2011 Stanley Plaza reopened after a major renovation which was part of the transfer from government ownership to Link REIT ownership.
A number of Asian and western restaurants, a good supermarket, Starbucks, Macdonald and a variety of shops can be found in Stanley Plaza.
Well integrated with the Stanley Main Street waterfront and historic Murray House, Stanley Plaza provides convenient access to nearby tourist spots such as Tin Hau Temple and Stanley Ma Hang Park.
========,3,Stanley's beaches.
Stanley is famous for its two beaches: Stanley Main Beach, located on the eastern side of the peninsular, and St. Stephen's Beach, on the western side.
Both beaches are sandy and have areas designed for barbecues.
Like many beaches in Hong Kong, they also have netted perimeters to protect swimmers from sharks.
The larger of the two beaches - Stanley Main Beach, which is also popular with windsurfers and other watersport enthusiasts, hosts the Stanley Dragon Boat Championships each year in June to celebrate the Tuen Ng Festival.
========,3,St Stephen's College.
St. Stephen's College is a primary and secondary school that has been located in Stanley for over 100 years.
It has both day students and boarding facilities.
Originally a private school, St. Stephen's College became a government-funded public school during the late 1900s.
The College recently announced its intention to become a Direct Subsidy Scheme (DSS) School, an historic change to the College as it will free the school from the centralised funding system that currently administers secondary education in Hong Kong.
If the plan is widely accepted by students, parents and alumni, this new plan will be implemented during the 2008-2009 academic year.
Pupils enrolled in the 2006 Primary 4 class at St. Stephen's College Preparatory School, also based in Stanley, will be the first group to enter the DSS system.
In order to upgrade the school administrative level, this is the first secondary school in Hong Kong to employ a Registered Professional Housing Manager on its staff to manage and handle all property and facilities-related issues for and on behalf of the school.

It is extremely easy to reach with several buses that go back and forth from all over Hong Kong, for example the bus routes 6, 6A, 6X, 66 and 260 (Citybus) from Central Exchange Square.
In addition to the many bus routes, Stanley is also served by a taxi stand, which is often full of taxis awaiting customers.
Although there is no MTR routes serve the Stanley area directly, nor there is currently a proposal for a line to serve this area.
The opening of South Island Line provides an alternative option for Stanley, as passengers can use Ocean Park Station and change to bus and minibus services to avoid traffic congestion in north Hong Kong island and Aberdeen Tunnel.
