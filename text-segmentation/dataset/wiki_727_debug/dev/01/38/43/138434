Ripley was originally owned and settled by William, John, and Lewis Rodgers.

The land was later sold to Jacob (and Ann) Starcher, most probably in 1803.
Jacob Starcher erected a grist mill in 1824 and laid out the town in 1830, naming it in honor of Harry Ripley, a young minister who was to be married, but drowned in Big Mill Creek, about one and a half miles north of the town, shortly before the ceremony took place.
When Jackson County was formed in 1831, the residents of the county could not decide where to locate the county seat.
The people who lived along the Ohio River near the Ravenswood settlement favored that location.
The people who lived farther inland objected.
The Virginia General Assembly appointed an independent commission to make the final decision which selected Ripley.
