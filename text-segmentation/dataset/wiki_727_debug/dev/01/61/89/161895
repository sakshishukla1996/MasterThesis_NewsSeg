========,2,Early life.
Arkin was born Alan Wolf Arkin in Brooklyn, New York City on March 26, 1934, the son of David I. Arkin, a painter and writer, and his wife, Beatrice (Wortis), a teacher.
He was raised in a Jewish family with "no emphasis on religion".
His grandparents were immigrants from Ukraine, Russia, and Germany.
His parents moved to Los Angeles when Alan was 11, but an 8-month Hollywood strike cost his father his job as a set designer.
During the 1950s Red Scare, Arkin's parents were accused of being Communists, and his father was fired when he refused to answer questions about his political ideology.
David Arkin challenged the dismissal, but he was vindicated only after his death.
========,2,Career.
========,3,Early work.
Arkin, who had been taking acting lessons since age 10, became a scholarship student at various drama academies, including one run by the Stanislavsky student Benjamin Zemach, who taught Arkin a psychological approach to acting.
Arkin attended Los Angeles City College from 1951 to 1953.
He also attended Bennington College.
With two friends, he formed the folk music group The Tarriers, in which Arkin sang and played guitar.
The band members co-composed the group's 1956 hit "The Banana Boat Song", a reworking, with some new lyrics, of a traditional, Jamaican calypso folk song of the same name, combined with another titled "Hill and Gully Rider".
It reached #4 on the "Billboard" magazine chart the same year as Harry Belafonte's better-known hit version.
The group appeared in the 1957 Calypso-exploitation film "Calypso Heat Wave", singing "Banana Boat Song" and "Choucoune".
From 1958 to 1968, Arkin performed and recorded with the children's folk group, The Baby Sitters.
He also performed the role of Dr. Pangloss in a concert staging of Leonard Bernstein's operetta "Candide", alongside Madeline Kahn's Cunegonde.
Arkin was an early member of the Second City comedy troupe in the 1960s.
========,3,Acting.
Arkin is one of only six actors to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his first screen appearance (for "The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming" in 1966).
Two years later, he was again nominated, for "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter".
In 1968, he appeared in the title role of "Inspector Clouseau" after Peter Sellers disassociated himself from the role, but the film was not well received by Sellers' fans.
Arkin and his second wife Barbara Dana appeared together on the 1970–1971 season of "Sesame Street" as a comical couple named Larry and Phyllis who resolve their conflicts when they remember how to pronounce the word "cooperate."
Arkin and Dana later appeared together again in 1987 on the ABC sitcom "Harry", which was canceled after four low-rated episodes.
His best known films include "Wait Until Dark" as the erudite killer stalking Audrey Hepburn; "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter," "Catch-22," "The Seven-Per-Cent Solution," "Little Murders," "The In-Laws," "Glengarry Glen Ross", and "Little Miss Sunshine", for which he won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar; and "Argo".
His portrayal of Dr. Oatman, a scared and emotionally conflicted psychiatrist treating John Cusack's hit man character Martin Q. Blank in "Grosse Point Blank" was also well received.
His role in "Little Miss Sunshine", as Grandfather Edwin, who was foul-mouthed and had a taste for snorting heroin, won him the BAFTA Film Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.
On receiving his Academy Award on February 25, 2007, Arkin said, "More than anything, I'm deeply moved by the open-hearted appreciation our small film has received, which in these fragmented times speaks so openly of the possibility of innocence, growth, and connection".
At 72 years old, Arkin was the sixth oldest winner of the Best Supporting Actor Oscar.
In 2006–2007, Arkin was cast in supporting roles in "Rendition" as a U.S. senator and "" as Bud Newman (Carol's Father), starring with Tim Allen, Martin Short, Elizabeth Mitchell, Judge Reinhold, and Wendy Crewson.
On Broadway, Arkin starred in "Enter Laughing" (for which he won a Tony Award) and "Luv".
He also directed "The Sunshine Boys", among others.
========,3,Directing.
In 1969, Arkin's directorial debut was a 12-minute children's film titled "People Soup", starring his sons Adam and Matthew Arkin.
Based on a story of the same name he published in "Galaxy Science Fiction" in 1958, "People Soup" is a fantasy about two boys who experiment with various kitchen ingredients until they concoct a magical soup which transforms them into different animals and objects.
His most acclaimed directorial effort is "Little Murders", released in 1971.
Written by cartoonist Jules Feiffer, "Little Murders" is a black comedy film starring Elliott Gould and Marcia Rodd about a girl, Patsy (Rodd), who brings home her boyfriend, Alfred (Gould), to meet her severely dysfunctional family amidst a series of random shootings, garbage strikes and electrical outages ravaging the neighborhood.
The film opened to a lukewarm review by Roger Greenspan, and a more positive one by Vincent Canby in the New York Times.
Roger Ebert's review in the Chicago Sun Times was more enthusiastic, saying, "One of the reasons it works and is indeed a definitive reflection of America's darker moods, is that it breaks audiences down into isolated individuals, vulnerable and uncertain."
Arkin also directed "Fire Sale" (1977), "Samuel Beckett Is Coming Soon" (1993) and "Arigo" (2000).
========,3,Writing.
Arkin is the author of many books, including "Tony's Hard Work Day" (illustrated by James Stevenson, 1972), "The Lemming Condition" (illustrated by Joan Sandin, 1976), "Halfway Through the Door: An Actor's Journey Toward Self" (1979), and "The Clearing" (1986 continuation of "Lemming").
In March 2011, he released his memoir, "An Improvised Life".
