========,1,preface.
Northville Township, officially the Charter Township of Northville, is a charter township of Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan and a suburb in Metro Detroit.
The population was 28,497 at the 2010 census.
The City of Northville is adjacent to the northern part of the township but is administratively autonomous.
Portions of Northville Township were incorporated into the Village of Northville, which later incorporated as the City of Northville.
Portions of the township have also since been annexed to the city.
The most recent annexation was property owned by the City of Northville as part of the Rural Hill Cemetery.
A majority of the township is served by Northville Public Schools.
A small portion of the township is served by Plymouth-Canton Community Schools.
The entire township is served by the Northville District Library and by its own police and fire departments.
========,2,History.
While the village of Northville developed within the borders of Plymouth Township from the 1820s, Northville Township itself did not exist until 1898.
At that time, local residents, allegedly feeling slighted by Plymouth Township officials being more focused on Plymouth Village, decided to split off into a separate township.
In this way, the former Plymouth "SuperTownship" (which formerly included all of Canton, Plymouth, and Northville Townships) became split into Plymouth Township and Northville Township.
Northville Township later became a charter township in 1985.
========,3,ZIP code.
In response to the rapid growth of the township, a new 48168 ZIP code was introduced in June 2005 to those living south of Seven Mile Road.
Those living on or north of the road (as well as those living in the city of Northville) kept the 48167 zip code, as well as any residents with a 48170 ZIP code (Plymouth).
========,3,2009 budget crisis and proposed public safety layoffs.
In late September 2009, just more than a month after the hospital property purchase, the Northville Township Board of Trustees stated that they were operating with a budget deficit.
The Board began the process of asking department heads and directors to find ways to cut their budgets.
One of the proposed cuts was the laying off of 5 police officers and 2 public safety dispatchers, roughly a 15-20% reduction in police manpower.
The Northville Township police union went door-to-door passing out flyers to educate the public on the board proposed cuts and to invite the public to voice their opinions on the issue to the township Board of Trustees.
On October 1, 2009, Northville Township residents voiced their displeasure over proposed public safety cuts on the 2010 budget.
Several of the residents in attendance criticized the Township Board of Trustees for not doing more to maintain the public safety department.
Board members came under scrutiny for supporting the August ballot initiative to buy the of the former Northville Regional Psychiatric Hospital property, knowing that there was a budget shortfall.
Several residents argued that the Board should have asked for a millage to support their current level of service, instead of asking voters to support the land purchase.
Township trustees stated that the two issues were unrelated.
On October 15, 2009, a little more than two months after the Psychiatric Hospital property vote, the Northville Township Board of Trustees approved the 2010 fiscal budget.
The budget, as approved, authorized the laying off of 5 police officers and 2 public safety dispatchers.
The budget also required many of the township's non-union employees to take mandatory furlough days.
In an attempt to prevent police layoffs, a local lottery winner proposed to give Northville Township the money necessary to make up for the alleged public safety budget deficit, approximately $640,000.
The Board of Trustees turned down the offer stating that one of its conditions, the maintenance of current public safety staffing, was not a condition they could legally accept.
The Board of Trustees stated that if the police officers’ union were to agree to concessions, then the layoffs would be avoided.
Residents continued to publicly voice their displeasure with the Board’s decision, with some residents even suggesting a possible campaign to recall the members of the township board.

========,2,Northville Regional Psychiatric Hospital.
The Northville Regional Psychiatric Hospital (NRPH) is located on a large (400+ acres) property on 7 Mile Road on the eastern side of the township.
It was built in 1952 and was closed in 2003.
As of 2011, the NRPH is standing and there are plans to demolish the buildings and clean the property.
However, there is no date set for this to take place.
========,3,2002-2006.
It was announced that the NRPH was to be closed by the Department of Community Health (DCH) on November 18, 2002.
By May 2003 all patients had been transferred to a community setting or another state run psychiatric facility.
Due to ineffective controls and oversight of the NRPH's closing in 2003, and purchasing, receiving, and payment processes, there is still much unused and used equipment left in the buildings that lost all value during storage.
The hospital was closed because of several reasons.
First, a declining number of patients in the statewide mental health system.
Second, a decline in the workforce, resulting from an early retirement rate, caused the hospital to be shut down.
At the time of the closing NPH had 536 employees and 239 patients.
The property was sold in a May 2005 auction to REI/Schostak (REIS) for $31.5 million.
========,3,2007-2008.
In October 2007, the sale of the property to REIS was closed.
REIS planned to develop the property into an $800 million, mixed-use residential, office, and retail development called 'Highwood'.
Due to the fact that Northville Township would only allow a scaled-down version of Highwood, REIS moved employees to the property in mid-October 2007 for security and to vote to annex the property into neighboring Livonia on August 5, 2008, which approved the original plans for Highwood.
Northville and Northville Township residents largely opposed the annexation, which was possible without their consent.
Only residents of the area being annexed and the city/township trying to annex the area could vote in the annexation.
Residents of the Township started an organization known as 'Stop Annexation'.
On August 5, 2008, the residents of the property and Livonia voted against annexation.
========,3,2009-present.
On August 4, 2009, residents of Northville Township voted to purchase a majority of the property for $23.5 million.
REIS will retain to develop into or less of retail.
An owner of a house worth $300,000 would see a tax increase of $144 (per year).
Using REIS tax dollars, Northville Township will clean the property extensively.
The property will become open, natural space with trails.
