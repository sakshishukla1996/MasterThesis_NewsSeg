========,2,History.
Originally called Rock Hall Crossroads, the town is now a quaint fishing, sailing and recreational boating town situated picturesquely on the upper Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay.
It is the center of Kent County’s maritime industries and is also a popular destination for art, music, culture and wildlife enthusiasts.
Even before the Town’s establishment in 1707, the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries have shaped the economic and cultural development of the Town.
In the early years, the Bay served as a commercial link to other populated areas on the western shore, such as Baltimore, Annapolis and Virginia, as well as northern areas such as Philadelphia and New York.
The town was named for a mansion made of white sandstone, and was incorporated in 1908.
Rock Hall served as a shipping point for tobacco, seafood and other agricultural products, as well as a passenger transport connection for travelers during the Colonial era.
Famous Americans, such as George Washington, James Madison and others have passed through Rock Hall numerous times traversing between Virginia and their northbound destinations.
Later, fishing and seafood processing became the Town’s largest industry, providing an economic base for commerce and town community life.
Maryland blue crabs, oysters, rockfish and more, although less plentiful today, have comprised the bountiful seasonal harvests of the Upper Chesapeake Bay.
Rock Hall Harbor continues to be a working harbor with an active fleet of commercial watermen who leave the dock each day.
Rock Hall has three museums including a Waterman's museum.
This is presently located in the Town Hall with many artifacts to preserve the heritage of the iconic way of life associated with the Chesapeake Bay waterman.
In recent years, recreational interests, shopping and tourism have emerged as a strong economic transformation with Rock Hall serving as one of the larger charter boat fishing and sailing centers on the Eastern Shore.
Hinchingham and Trumpington are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
