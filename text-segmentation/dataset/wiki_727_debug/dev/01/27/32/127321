========,2,History.
The hamlet of Mastic Beach was originally formed in 1928 by the Mastic Beach Property Owners Association (MBPOA), a private membership civic organization.
In 2010, a group of residents sought to incorporate Mastic Beach as a village.
Petitioners blamed the town of Brookhaven for not doing enough code enforcement on blighted streets and eyesore buildings, believing more diligent code enforcement under village control would improve the community aesthetics.
Opponents were concerned that creating the village would increase taxes, and that estimates for the proposed village's total budget were low.
At $549,500 annually, the village would take up building code enforcement, leaving police, fire, and sanitation to Brookhaven.
After a vote on August 31, 2010, incorporation was approved.
The proposed incorporation needed to be passed by a majority in order for the hamlet to become a village.
The first elected mayor was Paul Breschard.
The boundaries of the village of Mastic Beach differ from those of the previous census-designated place (CDP).
The village does not include the William Floyd House grounds as well as a few blocks in the extreme southwest of the CDP, but it adds several blocks west of Mastic Road and Commack Road.
Residents voted 1,922 to 1,215 on November 8, 2016, to revert to an unincorporated area with services handled by the Town of Brookhaven.
A formal dissolution plan was developed over several months and approved by the village board (4–1) at a special meeting on March 16, 2017.
The expected date of dissolution is January 1, 2018 at 12:01am.
This is the first dissolution of a village in New York State in recent history where property taxes will go up as a result.
