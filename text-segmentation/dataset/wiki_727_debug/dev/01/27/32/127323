========,2,History.
The Long Island Rail Road established the Medford Station in 1843 in a flat wilderness in the Long Island Central Pine Barrens.
The station connected to the Patchogue Stage Road between Patchogue and Port Jefferson, and a post office was established.
In 1850 the LIRR auctioned the land around the station.
The O.L.
Schwenke Land & Investment Co. bought and then subdivided the land into lots which sold for $10 to $75.
The land remained poor for farming.
According to legend, in a marketing attempt a mock factory with a phony roof was built near the tracks, and when a train neared, tar paper was burned to give the impression that a booming industry existed in the community.
In 1907 the LIRR established the Medford Prosperity Farm (officially called Experimental Station #2) on to show that crops could be raised in the Pine Barrens.
Theodore Roosevelt visited the station in August 1910.
As the car drove across a trail between Medford and Wading River, it got stuck in the mud and Roosevelt was said to take a "flying leap" to get out.
