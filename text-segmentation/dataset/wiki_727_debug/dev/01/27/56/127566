========,1,preface.
Irvington, sometimes known as Irvington-on-Hudson, is an affluent suburban village in the town of Greenburgh in Westchester County, New York, United States.
It is located on the eastern bank of the Hudson River, north of midtown Manhattan in New York City, and is served by a station stop on the Metro-North Hudson Line.
To the north of Irvington is the village of Tarrytown, to the south the village of Dobbs Ferry, and to the east unincorporated parts of Greenburgh, including East Irvington.
Irvington includes within its boundaries the community of Ardsley-on-Hudson, which has its own ZIP code and Metro-North station, but which should not be confused with the nearby village of Ardsley, New York.
The population of Irvington at the 2010 census was 6,420.
Because many of Irvington's residents – especially those in the upper income brackets – live in Irvington and work in New York City, the village has a reputation as a "commuter town" or a "bedroom community".
The village's Main Street area has been designated an historic district by New York State and on January 15, 2014 was added to the National Register of Historic Places.
In 2010, "Westchester Magazine" ranked Irvington as the "Best Place to Live in Westchester".
========,2,History.
Before the area where Irvington is now located was settled by Europeans, it was inhabited by the Wickquasgeck Indians, a band of the Wappingers, related to the Lenape (Delaware) tribes which dominated lower New York state and New Jersey.
The Wickquasgeck still lived in the area as late as 1775.
After the Dutch came to the area, the land was part of the Bisightick tract of the Van der Donck grant, which was purchsed by Frederick Philipse in 1682, after the British had taken over the area in 1664.
At first it was settled by tenant farmers, and but by the 1700s, most of the settlers were artisans.
The King's Highway, which connected New York City with Albany, was built through the settlement by the 1720s, which created a need for inns and taverns.
In 1785, the state of New York confiscated the Phillipse's land from his grandson, Frederick Philipse III, after he sided with the British in the American Revolution, and sold it to local patriot farmers who had been tenants of the Phillipse family.
This is presumably how part of it came to be the farm of William Dutcher.
Dutcher sold half of his farm to Justus Dearman in 1817, who then sold it to Gustavo F. Sacchi in 1848 for $26,000.
Sacchi sold the parcel to John Jay – the grandson of the American Founding Father by the same name – that same year, and Jay laid it out as a village which he called "Dearman", after Justus Dearman, and sold lots at auction in New York City starting on April 25, 1850.
The organization of the streets into a right-angled grid pattern was criticized by Andrew Jackson Downing, who was at the time the foremost expert on landscape design.
Downing condemned the use of the street grid outside of cities and saw the hilly and heavily wooded site of Dearman as particularly suited to his own theories, which called for curvilinear roads and irregular lots which followed the contours of the land.
With the frequent steamboat, stagecoach, and train transportation available, he felt that Dearman could have been an ideal suburb, instead of "mere rows of houses upon streets crossing each other at right angles and bordered with shade trees".
The side streets off the village's Main Street – or "Main Avenue", as an 1868 map has it – were originally designated "A", "B", "C", and so forth, but are today named after many of the area's early settlers, such as Barent and William Dutcher, Captain John Buckhout (who lived to 103) and Wolfert Ecker (or "Acker").
========,3,American Revolution.
Wolfert Ecker's house, then owned by Jacob van Tassel, was burned by the British in the Revolutionary War because it had become a notorious hang-out for American patriots.
Washington Irving later wrote about it under the name of "Wolfert's Roost" ("roost" meaning "rest"), and purchased and re-modeled another house on the land to become "Sunnyside".
Another early settler was Capt.
Jan Harnse, and the Harnse-Conklin-Odell Tavern on Broadway was built in 1693 and became an inn in 1743.
(See below) It was at Odell's Tavern that the Committee of Safety, the executive committee of the legislature of the new State of New York, officially received the news that George Washington had lost the Battle of Long Island, and, later, British troops camped nearby, putting Jonathan Odell into custody in the Old Dutch Church in Tarrytown.
No major battles of the Revolutionary War were fought in the area, only minor skirmishes between residents and soldiers.
With the capture of New York City by the British, Irvington and the rest of southern Westchester County became the "Neutral ground", an unofficial wide zone separating British-occupied territory from that held by the Americans, and the people of the area who remained – many of the Patriot population had fled – traded with both sides to great profit.
However, there was also a great deal of pillaging and plundering, even of Tory households, both by the regular British army and loyalist militias and irregulars, all in the name of hunting down rebels.
By the time the war was over, the countryside had been ravaged:
The country is rich and fertile, and the farms appear to have been advantageously cultivated, but it now has the marks of a country in ruins, a large portion of the proprietors having abandoned their homes.
On the high road where heretofore was a continuous stream of travelers and vehicles, not a single traveler was seen from week to week, month to month.
The countryside was silent.
The very tracks of the carriages were grown over with grass or weeds.
Travelers walked along bypaths.
The villages are abandoned, the residents having fled to the north, leaving their homes, where possible, in charge of elder persons and servants.
Eventually, the area recovered and continued to develop.
The Hudson River Railroad reached the settlement on September 29, 1849; the first passengers on a regularly scheduled run through the village paid fifty cents to travel from Peekskill to Chambers Street in Manhattan on September 29, 1849.
By 1853, a ferry ran across the Hudson from Dearman to Piermont on the west bank, the village had a population of around 600, a hotel, six stores, a lumber yard and around 50 houses, and the hamlet of "Abbotsford" – which would later become Ardsley-on-Hudson – was forming along Clinton Avenue.
========,3,A change of name.
In 1854 the Dearman and Abbotsford combined, and by popular vote adopted the common name "Irvington", to honor the American author Washington Irving, who was still alive at that time and living in nearby "Sunnyside" – which is today preserved as a museum.
Influential residents of the village prevailed upon the Hudson River Railroad, which had reached the village by 1849, to change the name of the train station to "Irvington", and also convinced the Postmaster to change the name of the local post office as well.
It was thus under the name of "Irvington" that the village incorporated on April 16, 1872.
By the census of 1860, the population of the village was 599.
A few years later, in 1863, Irvington was touched by the New York Draft Riots.
Fearing that the violence in the city, which had to be put down by Federal troops, would spread to Westchester, special police were brought in and quartered in a schoolhouse on Sunnyside Lane.
They were commanded by James Hamilton – the third son of Alexander Hamilton – whose estate, Nevis, was on South Broadway.
The presence of this special force deterred any violence a group of draft protestors which passed through Greenburgh on their way to Tarrytown may have intended.
This was the only instance in which Civil War-related activity directly affected Irvington.
With convenient rail transportation now available, the village's cool summer breezes off the Hudson and the rural riparian setting began to attract wealthy residents of New York City – businessmen, politicians and professionals – to the area to buy up farms and build large summer residences on their new estates, setting a pattern which would hold until the early 20th century.
Still, the village continued to expand, with various commercial enterprises opening along the waterfront.
Pateman & Lockwood, a lumber, coal and building supply company, opened in the village in 1853, and Lord & Burnham, which built boilers and greenhouses, in 1856.
Both expanded to newly created land across the railroad tracks, in 1889 and 1912 respectively, and the Cypress Lumber Company opened on a nearby site in 1909.
Nothwithstanding this commercial activity, for many years, through the 19th and early 20th centuries, Irvington was a relatively small community surrounded by numerous large estates and mansions where millionaires, aristocrats and captains of industry lived – the population was reported as 2,299 in 1890 and 2,013 in 1898.
After World War I, some of the bigger estates in the area were broken up into smaller lots.
Many of the estates and mansions are now gone, having been replaced by suburban sub-divisions, although a small number still exist.
After World War II, cooperative apartment complexes were built in the village, but despite these changes, Irvington still has many large houses, and is still an overwhelmingly well-heeled community.
========,3,Recent events.
In June 2016, Irvington Fire Chief Christopher D. DePaoli was one of 23 recipients of the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission medal for heroism.
In April 2015, DePaoli stepped in when he saw a woman being attacked by a man with a knife at the Irvington Metro-North Station.
DePaoli was able get between the man and the woman, the man's girlfriend, who was on the ground being stabbed, and distract him with a baseball bat until the police arrived.
The man was arrested and the woman survived the attack.
Since 2014, Irvington has held a "Celebrate Irvington" festival on the village's Main Street in the early summer.
========,2,Geography.
The village has a total area of , of which or about is land and , or 30.94%, is water.
The village's main thoroughfare is Broadway (Route 9) originally an Indian footpath which gradually became a horse track and then a dirt road.
It came to be called the "King's Highway" around the time that it reached Albany.
Later, it was called the "Queen's Highway", after Queen Anne, the "Highland Turnpike" after 1800 – a name still preserved in the nearby town of Ossining – the "Albany Post Road" and, after 1850, "Broadway".
The stretch that runs through Irvington was completed by 1723.
During his tenure as Postmaster General, Benjamin Franklin had sandstone milestone markers placed along the Broadway, inscribed with the distance from New York City.
Milestone #27 is still in place in Irvington, near the driveway to 30 South Broadway.
Broadway runs north-south parallel to the river, and connects Irvington to Dobbs Ferry in the south and Tarrytown in the north.
All of the village's major streets, including Main Street, extend east and west from Broadway, and are designated as such.
Broadway is designated "North Broadway" above Main Street, and "South Broadway" below it.
Main Street begins at the Metro-North train station, just off the Hudson River, and travels uphill to Broadway.
Side streets off of Main, which were originally designated A Street, B Street, C Street, etc.
when the village grid was laid out, now have names, most of which come from local history: Astor, Buckhout, Cottenet, Dutcher, Ecker, Ferris and Grinnell.
The southbound Saw Mill River Parkway can be reached via Harriman Road/Cyrus Field Road, past the village reservoir, or East Sunnyside Lane/Mountain Road through East Irvington.
The northbound Saw Mill and the New York State Thruway are accessible via Ardsley, and the Tappan Zee Bridge is nearby in Tarrytown.
Commuter train service to New York City is available at the Irvington and Ardsley-on-Hudson train stations, served by the Metro-North Railroad of the MTA.
Bus service is provided on Broadway by the Westchester County Beeline Bus System via route #1T (The Bronx-Yonkers-Tarrytown) and #1W (The Bronx-Yonkers-White Plains).
As with all river communities in Westchester, Irvington is traversed by a stretch of the old Croton Aqueduct, about long, which is now part of the Old Croton Trailway State Park.
The Aqueduct is a National Historic Landmark.

The Hudson Gateway Multiple Listing Service reported that the median sale price for a single-family home was $1.080 million, up from $790,000 in 2008.
Co-ops went from $223,000 to $263,000 and condos went down from $592,000 to $549,000.
========,2,Government and politics.
Irvington is governed by a Mayor, who is elected every two years in odd-numbered years, and four Trustees, who also serve two year terms.
Two of the Trustees are elected in odd-numbered years with the Mayor, and the other two in even-numbered years.
Each year, the Mayor appoints one of the Trustees to be Deputy Mayor.
A paid Village Administrator is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the village, assisted by a Clerk-Treasurer.
The administration is divided into eleven departments:

Irvington is protected by its own 22-person police department, along with a volunteer fire department and volunteer ambulance corps, all of which are located on Main Street.
Irvington's government communicates with the village's citizens through a newsletter, e-mail notifications and the village website.
========,3,2005 mayoral election.
The controversial 2005 Irvington mayoral election was held on March 15, 2005, but was not decided until October 27, 2005.
The race between Republican incumbent Dennis P. Flood and Democratic challenger Erin Malloy ended up being decided "by lots", as required by New York state law when a village election is tied (847 votes for each candidate).
The count that took place on election night gave Flood a one-vote lead.
On March 18, the Westchester County Board of Elections recounted the votes, giving Malloy a one-vote lead.
Turning to two unopened absentee ballots, the board found that one was for Flood, resulting in a tie.
The other absentee ballot was not opened as the name on the envelope did not match any names on the voter-registration list.
Susan B. Morton, who had registered to vote as Susan Brenner Morton, stepped forward three days later and demanded that her vote for Malloy be counted.
For several months afterward, various suits, motions, and appeals were filed in state courts.
On October 20, the Court of Appeals, New York State's highest court, denied requests by Malloy and Morton, leaving the election in a tie.
To comply with state law, the village had to use random lots to decide the winner.
State law does not specify the method of drawing lots, so the village opted to draw quarters from a bag.
Eight quarters were used.
Four had a bald eagle on the back and represented Malloy.
Flood was represented by four quarters with the Statue of Liberty on the back.
Village Trustee/Deputy Mayor Richard Livingston, a Republican, drew a quarter from the bag.
It was handed to Village Clerk Lawrence Schopfer, who declared Flood to be the winner.
Flood was then sworn in for his sixth two-year term as mayor of Irvington.
Months later, to complicate the situation even more, it was learned that an Irvington resident who has two houses and was registered to vote in both Irvington and a Long Island suburb, inadvertently broke the law by voting in both elections, although his intent was to cancel his Irvington voter registration.
He was an adamant supporter of Flood.
Erin Malloy was elected mayor in the election of 2007, but resigned in 2008 to spend more time with her injured daughter.
========,3,Infrastructure.
Irvington is one of 83 communities in New York State which are being considered by the New York State Energy and Research Development Authority for the installation of a microgrid system, which would run under Main Street.
The village's power lines would be moved underground and solar and natural gas generators would be utilized to make it 80% power self-sufficient.
In the initial phase, the Board of Trustees is in discussion with a possible technology provider.
There are no current community microgrids in New York.
========,2,Education.
========,3,Primary and secondary schools.
Irvington Union Free School District<br> Irvington is part of the Irvington Union Free School District, which also includes East Irvington, an unincorporated area of the Town of Greenburgh, and the Pennybridge section of Tarrytown, Irvington's northern neighbor.
The schools are Dows Lane School (K-3), Main Street School (4&5), Irvington Middle School (6-8), and Irvington High School (9-12).
The Middle School and High School are sited together on a combined campus on Heritage Hill Road off of North Broadway, on the site where the Stern castle, "Greystone", once stood.
Stern purchased the property from Augustus C. Richards in the late nineteenth century.
The school system, the student population of which was around 1,900 in 2013, is known for its small class size and emphasis on academics; and about 98% of graduates go on to higher education.
In 2012, the average SAT scores were 571 (reading), 583 (math) and 573 (writing), compared to the statewide averages of 496.
514 and 488, and 74.7 percent of fourth grade students met state standards in English, and 66.1 percent in math, compared to statewide averages of 30.3 and 36.3 percent.
In 2015, "U.S. News & World Report" rated Irvington High School as number 32 in New York State, making it the ninth-best in Westchester, while the next year it was ranked as #198 in the United States, and #35 in New York, with a college readiness index of 70.3, and a student-teacher ratio of 12:1.
In 2016, Niche.com, a rating and ranking website, listed Irvington High School as the #83 high school in New York, and #595 in the country.
The next year, in 2017, "U.S.News" ranked the high school as #45 in New York state, and #377 in the country, which won it a gold medal for being in the top 500 nationally.
In June 2016, Niche rated the Irvington school district as #42 in New York State.
In October of that year, Niche also listed Irvington as New York State's #16 best school district to teach in.
In January 2017, Niche rated the Irvington school system as #29 among all the public school systems in New York state.
Abbott School<br> Located in Irvington, but not part of the regular public school district, was the Abbott School, which served homeless, neglected, abused, or developmentally disabled boys in grades 2 through 9.
The students came both from the residential Abbott House, where the school was located, and as day students from community schools in Westchester County, [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]], and New York City.
The school graduated its last class in 2011, and as of 2013 legislation is pending to dissolve the special school district, and the 15-acre property is listed for sale.
Abbot House's administrative offices remain in the former school building in Irvington.
Immaculate Conception School<br> The Immaculate Conception School, a Catholic elementary school located in Irvington, was closed by the [[Archdiocese of New York]] in June 2008, after 100 years of existence.
In the 2009-2010 school year, John Cardinal O'Connor School, a Catholic non-denominational school for students in grades 2 through 8 with learning disabilities, which had formerly been St. Ursula's Learning Center in [[Mount Kisco]], moved into the vacant building.
========,3,Colleges.
There are no colleges located totally in Irvington, although part of the campus of [[Mercy College (New York)|Mercy College]], founded in 1950, is located in Irvington, while the majority is just over the southern border in [[Dobbs Ferry, New York|Dobbs Ferry]], very close to Irvington's Ardsley-on-Hudson train station, which is sub-labelled "Mercy College".
In 1890, Mary F. Bennett founded [[Bennett College (New York)|Bennett College]] in the village, but in 1907 it moved to [[Millbrook, New York|Millbrook]] in [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess County]].
In that same year, [[Marymount College, Tarrytown|Marymount College]] was founded in [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]], north of the village.
It later became a campus of [[Fordham University]], but closed in 2007.
[[Columbia University]] maintains its [[Nevis Laboratories]] in Irvington, along with an agricultural research center and offices of [[Columbia University Press]].
[[File:Irvington Presb from S jeh.jpg|thumb|225px|The village's Presbyterian Church]]
========,2,Religion.
Irvington has four Christian churches.
Three of them, the Irvington Presbyterian Church ([[Presbyterian]]), the Immaculate Conception Church ([[Roman Catholic]]) and The Church of St. Barnabas ([[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]]), are clustered together on Broadway, just north of Main Street.
The Calvary Chapel of Westchester ([[Calvary Chapel|Evangelical]]) is located in the [[#Trent|Trent Building]] on South Buckhout Street.
The Jewish community of Irvington is served by three nearby [[synagogue]]s: the traditional/non-denominational Chabad of the Rivertowns, the conservative Greenburgh Hebrew Center in Dobbs Ferry and the dual reform/conservative synagogue Temple Beth Abraham in Tarrytown.
Irvington itself features a "chavruah," or member-led Jewish congregation that follows in the conservative tradition, known as Rosh Pinah Chavruah of the Rivertowns.
Irvington is also the location of the Westchester Buddhist Center, whose Executive Director is interior designer Stacy T. Curchak.
Irvington is home to a number of members of the [[Unification Church]], including several high-ranking families.
There are several Church-owned estates and buildings located in Irvington and in the neighboring village of [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]].
Reverend [[Sun Myung Moon]], the founder and, until his death in 2010, the spiritual leader the Church, had a large private estate of , the former Frederic Clark Sayles estate, on East Sunnyside Lane.
As of 2012, the estate was still owned by the church, under its legal name "Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity".
========,2,Local media.
From 1912 to 1998, Irvington's daily newspaper was the "Tarrytown Daily News".
In 1998, the [[Gannett Company]], the last owner of the newspaper, folded all their area local papers, including the "Daily News", into "[[The Journal News]]", which serves Westchester, [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]] and [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam]] counties, an area also referred to as the [[Hudson Valley|Lower Hudson Valley]].
In the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, the village was also served by the "Irvington Gazette", a weekly newspaper which was published on Aqueduct Street.
From 1975 to the present, the "Rivertowns Enterprise", a weekly newspaper, has reported on local government, schools, sports, arts and business in Irvington as well as [[Ardsley, New York|Ardsley]], [[Dobbs Ferry, New York|Dobbs Ferry]], and [[Hastings-on-Hudson, New York|Hastings-on-Hudson]].
Additionally, the "Hudson Independent", a monthly free newspaper begun in 2006, serves Irvington, [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], and [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]], an area also covered by the "River Journal", an online news site.
========,2,Quality of life.
In an October 2010 ranking of the "Best Places to Live", "Westchester Magazine" listed Irvington as #1, remarking that the village is:
Charming, quiet, green, with a darling Main Street, stunning river views, [and] a [[#Restaurants|burgeoning dining scene]] ... this unassuming rivertown is pretty near perfect.
... [The village] scored the highest in our tally, getting a perfect 10 for safety and proximity to water ... a 9 for its [[#Education|schools]] ... and an 8 for its [[#Parks and recreation|green space]] ... All in all, a great mix.
Factors in which Irvington did not score well in this ranking were "Diversity" and "Property tax", both with a score of four out of ten, and "Housing cost", which earned a five.
In May 2015, the village released a report which indicated that its water supply exceeded the requirements laid down by the State of New York, and later that year, it was reported that Irvington ranked #6 on a list of the safest places in New York based on FBI crime data.
On the other hand, in February 2016 the website "RoadSnacks", in an article which made clear that it was "opinion based on fact" and intended as "infotainment", not as serious science, listed Irvington as the third most boring place in New York State, after [[Briarcliff Manor, New York|Briarcliff Manor]] and [[Rye Brook, New York|Rye Brook]] in Westchester, and just above [[Croton-on-Hudson, New York|Croton-on-Hudson]], also in Westchester, and [[Chestnut Ridge, New York|Chestnut Ridge]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]].
In November 2016, Irvington was rated as #17 on a list of the "30 Safest Places To Live In New York – 2016".
Its violent crime rate per 1000 was 0.2, and its property crime rate, also per 1000, was 2.7.
[[Niche (company)|Niche.com]], a rating and ranking website, listed Irvington as #16 of all New York locations on its list of "Best Suburbs to Live in America", although it was not listed in the top 100 in the U.S., nor was any location in New York.
Factors considered for the April 2017 list included the quality of the schools, the crime rate, employment, amenities, using data from the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]].
the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]].
In May 2017, Niche rated Irvington as "A+" in their list of the best and worst places to live in New York.
========,3,Parks and recreation.
As of 2013 about a third of Irvington's land is undeveloped public land, and, as of 2010, 23 percent of the land in Irvington is set aside for parks and recreation.
Three of Irvington's parks, Memorial Park "(Dows Lane or Station Road)", Matthiessen Park "(Bridge Street off Astor Street)", and Halsey Pond Park, are open only to village residents with a permit, but others are accessible by the general public.
The Irvington Parks and Recreation Department is located in the Isabel K. Benjamin Community Center on Main Street.

***LIST***.
========,3,Restaurants.
In 2009, "Westchester Magazine" named Irvington as the best place for "foodies" to live on the west side of Westchester County, although the article named only two restaurants in the village itself – "Red Hat" and "Chutney Masala" – as well as others in nearby [[Dobbs Ferry, New York|Dobbs Ferry]], [[Hastings, New York|Hastings]] and [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]].
In May 2012, chef Michael Psilakis opened "MP Taverna" in an old warehouse near the river.
In 2013, the Sixty One Bistro opened at 61 Main Street, and in November 2014, "Wolfert's Roost" – named after the original name of Washington Irving's Sunnyside estate – opened at 100 Main Street with an "exuberant" menu, which includes a 38-ounce steak for $129 that "looks like something Fred Flintstone might have slapped on the grill"; in October 2016 it was announced that it would be closing as a full-time restaurant in favor of catering and occasional "pop up" restaurants.
The owner, Eric Korn, was also opening a traditional pizza shop on the same block.
Also on Main Street is "La Chinita Poblana", which also opened in 2014, a strong, un-"kitschy" Mexican restaurant decorated with paintings by [[Diego Rivera]], and "Chutney Masala", a [[Tandoori]] restaurant, which moved in 2016 from the Irvington waterfront to 76 Main Street.
In October 2016, the owner of "Chutney Masala" opened "Sambal Thai and Malaysian" on Main Street.
In addition, [[Irvington (Metro-North station)|Irvington's former New York Central Railroad station house]], which was a ticket office from 1889 to 1957, is now, in 2016, with the addition of an outdoor garden, "Brrzaar", a 20-seat café serving [[frozen yogurt]].
