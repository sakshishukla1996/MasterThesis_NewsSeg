========,1,preface.
The University of Queensland (UQ) is an Australian research university primarily located in Queensland's capital city, Brisbane.
As one of Australia's leading universities, UQ is consistently ranked first for business administration, mining engineering and life sciences in Australasia.
UQ also admits the majority of its state's top achievers.
The main campus occupies much of the riverside inner suburb of St Lucia, southwest of the Brisbane central business district.
Other UQ campuses and facilities are located throughout Queensland, the largest of which are the Gatton campus and the Herston medical school.
UQ's overseas establishments include the Brunei Clinical School and the UQ-Ochsner Clinical School in Louisiana, United States.
Founded in 1909 by the state parliament, UQ is one of Australia's oldest universities colloquially known as a sandstone university.
The University of Queensland is a founding member of online higher education consortium edX, Australia's research-intensive Group of Eight, and the global Universitas 21 network.
The university offers associate, bachelor, master and doctoral degrees through a college, a graduate school and six faculties.
As a research university, UQ incorporates over one hundred research institutes and centres, such as the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, the Queensland Brain Institute and the Institute for Molecular Bioscience.
Recent research achievements of the university include pioneering the invention of the HPV vaccine that prevents cervical cancer and the development of high-performance superconducting MRI magnets for portable scanning of human limbs.
Two Nobel laureates have been associated with UQ as alumni and staff.
Over recent decades, UQ has produced notable alumni across a range of professions, including Nobel laureate in Physiology or Medicine Peter C. Doherty, Triple Crown of Acting winner Geoffrey Rush, triple Grammy Award winner Tim Munro, and the Presidents of General Electric-Europe, Dow Chemical, King's College London and University of California, San Francisco.
========,2,History.
========,3,Foundation of the university.
Proposals for a university in Queensland began in the 1870s.
A royal commission in 1874, chaired by Sir Charles Lilley, recommended the immediate establishment of a university.
Those against a university argued that technical rather than academic education was more important in an economy dominated by primary industry.
Those in favour of the university, in the face of this opposition, distanced themselves from Oxford and Cambridge and proposed instead a model derived from the mid-western states of the United States.
A second royal commission in 1891 recommended the inclusion of five faculties in a new university; arts, law, medicine, science and applied science.
Education generally was given a low priority in Queensland's budgets, and in a colony with a literacy rate of 57% in 1861, primary education was the first concern well ahead of secondary and technical education.
The government, despite the findings of the royal commissions, was unwilling to commit funds to the establishment of a university.
In 1893, the Queensland University Extension Movement was begun by a group of private individuals who organised public lecture courses in adult education, hoping to excite wider community support for a university in Queensland.
In 1894, 245 students were enrolled in the extension classes and the lectures were described as practical and useful.
In 1906 the University Extension Movement staged the University Congress, a forum for interested delegates to promote the idea of a university.
Opinion was mobilised, a fund was started and a draft bill for a Queensland university was prepared.
Stress was laid on the practical aspects of university education and its importance for the commerce of Queensland.
The proceedings of the congress were forwarded to the Premier of Queensland, William Kidston.
In October 1906, sixty acres in Victoria Park were gazetted for university purposes.
The University of Queensland was established by an act of state parliament on 10 December 1909 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Queensland's separation from the colony of New South Wales.
The act allowed for the university to be governed by a senate of 20 men and Sir William MacGregor, the incoming governor, was appointed the first chancellor with Reginald Heber Roe as the vice chancellor.
Government House (now Old Government House) in George Street was set aside for the university following the departure of the governor to the Bardon residence, "Fernberg", sparking the first debates about the best location for the university.
In 1910 the first teaching faculties were created.
These included engineering, classics, mathematics and chemistry.
In December of the same year, the senate appointed the first four professors; Bertram Dillon Steele in chemistry, John Lundie Michie in classics, Henry James Priestley in mathematics and Alexander James Gibson in engineering.
In 1911 the first students enrolled.
The university's first classes in the Government House were held in 1911 with 83 commencing students and Sir William MacGregor is the first chancellor (with Reginald Heber Roe as vice-chancellor).
The University of Queensland began to award degrees to its first group of graduating students in 1914.
========,3,1920s to 1990s.
The development of the university was delayed by World War I, but after the first world war the university enrollments for education and research took flight as demand for higher education increased in Australia.
Thus, in the early 1920s the growing university had to look for a more spacious campus as its original site in George Street, Brisbane, had limited room for expansion.
In 1927, James O'Neil Mayne and his sister, Mary, provided a grant of approximately £50,000 to the Brisbane City Council to acquire of land in St Lucia and provided it to the University of Queensland as its permanent home.
In the same year, the pitch drop experiment was started by Thomas Parnell.
The experiment has been described as the world's oldest and continues to this day.
Lack of finance delayed development of the St Lucia campus.
Hence, the construction of the university's first building in St Lucia only began in 1938.
It was later named the Forgan Smith Building, after the premier of the day and it was completed in 1939.
During World War II, the Forgan Smith Building was used as a military base and it served first as advanced headquarters for the Allied Land Forces in the South West Pacific.
The first Doctor of Science was awarded in 1942.
The first PhD was awarded in 1952.
========,3,1990s to present day.
In 1990, Australia reorganised its higher education system by abolishing the binary system of universities and colleges of advanced education.
Under this transition, the university merged with Queensland Agricultural College, to establish the new UQ Gatton campus.
In 1999, UQ Ipswich began operation as one of the completely Web-enabled campuses in Australia.
In 2010, the University of Queensland was a recipient of the Queensland Greats Awards.
In May 2013, UQ joined edX, an international consortium of massive open online courses (MOOCs).
Due to start in May 2014, the initial four UQx courses will cover hypersonics, tropical coastal ecosystems, biomedical imaging and the science of everyday thinking.
========,2,Campuses and facilities.
The University of Queensland maintains a number of campuses and facilities throughout Queensland.
UQ has its main campus in the suburb of St Lucia in Brisbane, bordered by a meander in the Brisbane River to the north, east, and south.
UQ's main campus has been recognized for its beauty by a number of sources.
Its other campuses include Gatton and Herston.
========,3,St Lucia campus.
In 1927, the land on which the St Lucia campus is built was resumed by the Brisbane City Council using money donated by James O'Neil Mayne and his sister Mary Emelia Mayne to replace the less spacious city campus.
The city campus is now home to the Gardens Point campus of the Queensland University of Technology.
Construction of the new university at St Lucia began in 1937.
========,4,Great Court.
At its centre is the heritage-listed Great Court – a open area surrounded by Helidon sandstone buildings with grotesques of great academics and historic scenes, floral and faunal motifs and crests of universities and colleges from around the world.
This central semi-circular quadrangle features a connected arcade so students could reach any section under cover.
The Great Court was added to the Queensland Heritage Register in 2002.
========,4,Transport and other amenities.
The campus includes sporting fields, gardens, duck ponds, and cycling tracks.
The Ring Road which runs from Sir William McGregor Drive to Chancellor's place running past the Union Complex and the Bookshop and the JD Story Building enables access close to most of the built areas on campus for dropping off from vehicles.
The university is served by the University of Queensland ferry wharf, the westernmost stop and terminus of the CityCat service.
TransLink also operates two bus stations on campus: the University of Queensland bus station at Chancellor's Place in the west, connecting passengers to Brisbane's inner west suburbs such as Indooroopilly, Toowong and Milton; and the UQ Lakes busway station in the east, the western terminus of the Eastern Busway, with services to Brisbane's inner south suburbs such as Woolloongabba, Carindale and Mount Gravatt via the Eleanor Schonell Bridge.
This bridge also allows pedestrians and cyclists to cross the Brisbane River, to reach Dutton Park.
The closest stops of the Queensland Rail City network are the Toowong railway station, Park Road railway station, and Dutton Park railway station.
There are 3 refectories that provide food for students.
These are the Main Refectory in the Student Union Complex, the Biological Sciences Refectory under the Biological Sciences Library, and the Physiology Refectory under the Physiology Lecture Theatres.
The Student Union Complex houses the Student Union and other student services.
========,4,Museums.
The University of Queensland Art Museum is located in the James and Mary Emelia Mayne Centre on the St Lucia campus.
The Art Museum was established in the Forgan Smith Tower in 1976 to house the artworks collected by The University of Queensland since the 1940s, relocating to its present site in 2004.
Today, with more than 3,000 artworks, the University's Art Collection is Queensland's second largest public art collection.
The university also houses the R.D.
Milns Antiquities Museum in the Michie building (bldg 9, level 2) which contains Queensland's only publicly accessible collection of antiquities from ancient Rome, Greece, Egypt and the Near East.
The museum supports research and teaching at the university.
The UQ Anthropology museum (also in the Michie Building on level 1) contains a significant collection of ethnographic material.
It is also open to the public.
========,3,Gatton campus.
The UQ Gatton Campus is a 1068-hectare campus which is located at Lawes, Queensland, near the town of Gatton, Queensland, about west of Brisbane on the Warrego Highway.
The campus was opened in 1897 next to the site of the Queensland Agricultural College which was then amalgamated with UQ in 1990.
UQ Gatton is the core campus for research, learning and teaching activities and facilities in agriculture, animals, veterinary science and the environment.
In 2008 the Centre for Advanced Animal Science (CAAS) was opened at the Gatton campus – a collaborative venture between UQ and the Queensland Government.
========,3,Herston campus.
UQ Mayne Medical School and the Queensland Institute of Medical Research is the core campus for clinical health teaching and research.
The campus is situated in Herston and operates within Queensland Health system of the Royal Brisbane Hospital, Royal Children's Hospital, Royal Women's Hospital and the Queensland Institute of Medical Research.
It is home to the Faculty of Medicine, the School of Population Health, the Herston Health Sciences Library, the Centre for Clinical Research and clinical research and learning activities of the School of Nursing and Midwifery.
The medical school building was added to the Queensland Heritage Register in 1999.
The Marks-Hirschfeld Museum of Medical History is located in the Mayne Medical School at the Herston campus.
Operated by volunteers and supported by the University of Queensland Alumni, it has a collection of over 7,000 items of medical memorabilia, medical and surgical instruments.
The focus is on the study of medical history in Queensland, but the collection includes items with broader significance to Australia and internationally.

========,3,Ipswich campus.
The Ipswich campus was made up of nearly 20 buildings and more than 5001 students on nearly .
Courses offered included: arts, business, medicine and social sciences as well as Interaction design.
It is located near central Ipswich, Queensland, just south of the CBD.
Nearby landmarks include Limestone Park, Workshops Rail Museum and RAAF Base Amberley.
The site dates back to 1878 with the opening of the Ipswich branch of the Woogaroo Lunatic Asylum.
Operations continued until 1910 when it became the Ipswich Hospital for the Insane.
In 1938 it was renamed the Ipswich Mental Hospital and in 1964 it was renamed again as the Ipswich Special Hospital.
It was finally named the Challinor Centre in 1968 in honour of Dr Henry Challinor, the ship's surgeon on the "Fortitude".
From 1968-97 the Challinor Centre served as an institution for people with intellectual disabilities.
In late 1997 the Challinor Centre began its first stage of transformation as the new UQ Ipswich campus.
In 2014, UQ sold the Ipswich Campus to the University of Southern Queensland, believing that this regional teaching campus would be better utilised by USQ.
========,3,Satellite teaching and research centres.
