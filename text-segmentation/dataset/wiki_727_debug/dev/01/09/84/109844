========,2,History.
The town's name is a corruption of "Lockchoppe", derived from the Muskogee "lokchapi" ("lokcha" (acorn) / "api" (stem)), which was the old name of the nearby river.
Sopchoppy came into existence in 1894.
After the CT&G Railroad Company had built a railway through the area, it platted the town on property it already owned in the area, across the river from Greenough.
To encourage people to settle there, the railroad engaged in a significant advertising campaign, exaggerating the quality of the soil and climate.
========,2,Festivals.
The town is home to the annual Worm Grunting Festival, a town celebration named in honor of a worm grunting — also known as worm charming — a method for driving worms to the surface of the earth.
Worm charmers hammer wooden stakes into the ground, then rub them with metal slabs.
The resulting vibrations cause worms to surface, whereupon they are typically gathered and used or sold for fishing bait.
Sopchoppy is one of the settings and worm grunting a plot element in the 2017 novel "Clownfish Blues" by Tim Dorsey.
