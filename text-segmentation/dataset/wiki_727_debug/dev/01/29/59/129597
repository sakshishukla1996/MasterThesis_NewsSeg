========,2,History.
Medina was founded in 1818 as part of the Connecticut Western Reserve.
It was originally named Mecca, but an unincorporated community in Ohio already had that name, so the name was changed.
Both Mecca and Medina are cities in Saudi Arabia and particularly significant to Islam.
Most early residents were farmers.
In the 1830s, growth of the community was aided by the completion of the Ohio and Erie Canal, which helped transport agricultural products to markets.
In 1835, Medina was incorporated as a village and as the county seat of Medina County, Ohio.
By 1855, the town's quarries were producing over $200,000 worth of stone per year.
In 1857, many of the canal workers started a strike for higher wages; the striking workers were fired, and the four workers who started it were jailed in Albion, Ohio.
In 1869, Amos Root founded the A.I.
Root Company in Medina as a manufacturer of beehives and beekeeping equipment, and the town became a center for beehive manufacturing.
The Root company had 97 workers in 1886, making it the townâ€™s largest employer.
In the mid-1800s, two disastrous fires hit the village.
The fire of 1848 destroyed the entire business district.
In 1870, another large fire, which started at a wooden building with a barber shop, consumed all but two blocks of the business district, and nearly wiped out the entire town.
The fire was particularly fierce because all the town's buildings were made of wood.
With no facilities for extinguishing fires, the residents attempted to put out the fire using a bucket brigade, but to no avail, as the fire burned for four hours.
None of the town's 1,159 residents perished from the fire.
It took almost ten years to rebuild this area which would become known as Public Square.
It is now considered a historic district that includes nine blocks of stores and draws many visitors for its various festivals and private and public events.
In 1952, Medina had over 5,000 residents, and on May 6, 1952 it was chartered as a city.
