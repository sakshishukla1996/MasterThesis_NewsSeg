========,2,History.
The birth of the town, and its name, are related to the first set of lock gates that one would have encountered heading north on the Miami and Erie Canal.
The canal served as a major transportation route linking commerce from as far as New Orleans to New York City.
Many people and industry were attracted to the western Ohio area by the idea of connecting Lake Erie to the Ohio River.
Lockland provided an abundance of water power, having a difference in water tables.
This allowed for a water mill which ground flour for local farmers.
A large reservoir pond allowed boats to dock for repairs or layover.
Even today a section of Lockland is still referred to as "Bud-Town" which was the bedding and entertainment area of the day.
Despite the locomotive boom the canal remained semi-operational until 1929.
The canal sat still for a few years during the thirties.
The Mill Creek Expressway reused some portions of the dead canal as well as the Wright-Lockland Highway.
The National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956 created today's interstate system, including Interstate 75 along the Mill Creek Expressway.
Lockland's past and future are directly related to the growth of national transportation and commerce.
Lockland was home to the Stearns and Foster Mattress company, which was founded in Cincinnati in 1846 and moved to Lockland in 1880.
The original factory and office building still stand in the downtown area of the village.
However, after a fire in 2004 the two factory buildings, which sit on approximately , began to be demolished.
