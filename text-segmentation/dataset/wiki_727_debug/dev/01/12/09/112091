========,2,History.
Native American tribes originally inhabited the region.
Stephen Mack, Jr. was the first white settler in the Rockton area.
He was married to Hononegah, a respected Native American woman from one of the surrounding tribes.
His original outpost (c. 1830s) eventually became Macktown.
William Talcott arrived to the area later and, after a disagreement with Mack, settled on the other side of the nearby river within the present village of Rockton.
Citizens who lived in Macktown would frequently travel across the river to Rockton but in 1851, the bridge from Macktown to Rockton washed away.
The bridge had been built with funding from Stephen Mack and its destruction, along with Mack's death in 1850, led citizens to permanently move to Rockton.
In northern Illinois, Macktown is the only community from the 1830s that is still standing without subsequent development.
