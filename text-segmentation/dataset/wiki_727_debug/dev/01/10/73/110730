========,2,History.
Bovill was named for a settler.
Hugh Bovill was an Englishman who bought the Warren Meadows homestead in 1901 to ranch.
With the rapid infusion of loggers, homesteaders, and sportsmen, Bovill and his wife Charlotte opened a hotel in 1903, which included a store and post office in 1907.
The railroad arrived that same year and as logging activity increased nearby, the town became too wild for the couple and their two daughters, and they left in 1911 (Hugh died in 1935 in Oregon, Charlotte in 1947 in California).
On 15 April 1912, the workers at the Number 4 and Number 8 camp near Bovill of the Potlatch Lumber Company went on strike for better rations and a twenty-five cent per day pay raise.
Notice of the strike was published in the "Industrial Worker", a weekly newspaper of the Industrial Workers of the World which was published out of Spokane, Washington at the time.
