Spaghetti squash is relatively easy to grow, thriving in gardens or in containers.
The plants are monoecious, with male and female flowers on the same plant.

Female flowers are shorter, with a small round growth underneath the petals.
This round growth turns into the squash if the flower is successfully pollinated.
Spaghetti squash plants may cross-pollinate with zucchini plants.
