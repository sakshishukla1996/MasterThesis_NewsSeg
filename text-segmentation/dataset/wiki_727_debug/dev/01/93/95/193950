========,1,preface.
Point of Know Return is the fifth studio album by American rock band Kansas, released in 1977.
The album was reissued in remastered format on CD in 2002, and reissued as "Playlist: Cool Songs".
========,2,Time of recording.
Singer/songwriter Steve Walsh left the group briefly.
He would admit that, at this point, he had been something of a prima donna in an interview with nationally syndicated radio host Redbeard on the weekly rockumentary series "In the Studio with Redbeard" (edition #849, week of September 27, 2004 and again on the 30th Anniversary Episode for "Point of Know Return" in 2007).
========,2,Background.
The album is criticized for singles like "Point of Know Return".
"Point of Know Return" was a later addition to the album.
"Portrait (He Knew)" was written about Albert Einstein.
In 1988, Livgren released an updated version of "Portrait (He Knew)" titled "Portrait II" as part of the album "Prime Mover" credited to his band AD.
He changed the subject of the song from Einstein to Jesus Christ.
"Closet Chronicles" is a Howard Hughes allegory.
"Dust in the Wind" is known for its sparse acoustic nature.
The guitar line for the song was written by Kerry Livgren as a finger exercise for learning fingerpicking.
His wife, Vicci, heard what he was doing, remarked that the melody was nice, and encouraged him to write lyrics for it.
Livgren was unsure whether his fellow band members would like it, since it was a departure from their signature style.
However he did offer it to them, and the song was accepted and then recorded.
========,2,Reception.
"Rolling Stone" gave the album a mixed review, saying that though the transition to shorter songs generally works, the lyrics are "a wan and ridiculous rehash of the bargain-basement exoticism employed by the British art-rock crowd."
They commented that though the band lacks a virtuoso soloist, the band's ensemble playing is strong and purposeful.
"Point of Know Return" would be Kansas' highest charting album in the US, peaking at #4 in January 1978, and would sell four million copies in the US and be certified Quadruple Platinum by the RIAA.
========,2,Cultural impact.
 During a debate of greatest "Song 1 Side 1" in history among the lead characters in the movie "High Fidelity", Jack Black's character criticizes one of John Cusack's character's proposals as "too obvious, like 'Point of Know Return'".
The album cover has become an iconic image from the album rock era, appearing on the background of the set of VH1 Classic, on tee shirts worn by characters in movies and on TV, and in other places.
In October 2009, a live version of the title track was released as a downloadable add-on to the Harmonix video game "Rock Band".
The title track has also been used in a 2009 State Farm commercial, in which a man sings along to it in his parked car.
In the 2008 movie "The Rocker", Rainn Wilson's character Robert Fishman is seen wearing a "Point of Know Return" T-shirt.
"Nobody's Home" is sampled by rapper J Dilla on the song "So Far" on his 2016 posthumous release "The Diary".
The sample is not the Kansas version of the song.
========,2,Track listing.
The remix of "Portrait (He Knew)" marks the third time the song has been remixed.
A remix appeared on the original 45 of the song.
A different remix appeared on the bonus disc of a Europe-only collection from the late 1990s.
