========,2,Geology.
The Border Ranges region, which includes the McPherson Range, Tweed Range, Lamington Plateau and Levers Plateau, were formed from the erosion of the Tweed Volcano over many years.
A number of volcanic plugs remain in the Border Ranges National Park.
Notable for extensive stands of "Nothofagus moorei" (Antarctic beech), the park offers a gravel road circuit through sub tropical, cool and warm temperate rainforest types.
The area was extensively logged during the 20th century, providing timber to a number of nearby sawmills.
The Lions Road and the Sydneyâ€“Brisbane rail corridor pass through the park at its narrow middle section.
========,2,Flora and fauna.
Border Ranges and Lamington National Park are recognised as a biodiversity hotspot, containing a mixture of northern and southern flora species (the McPherson-Macleay overlap) with a number of endemic, rare and endangered species.
Fauna is similarly diverse and species like the Hastings River mouse, have been rediscovered in the park in recent years.
Lower areas of the park contain eucalypt forests that provide habitat for eastern grey kangaroos, red-necked wallabies and koalas.
Pademelons and potoroo are also found in the park as well as a diverse array of birdlife including the rare Albert's lyrebird.
The park is part of the Scenic Rim Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance in the conservation of several species of threatened birds.
