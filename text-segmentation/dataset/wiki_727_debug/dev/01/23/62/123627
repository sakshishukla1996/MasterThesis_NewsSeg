========,2,History.
Walkerville was a suburb of Butte, Montana and is home to some of the earliest mining sites in the area.
These sites attracted many investors to Walkerville in the late 1800s.
There were many different types of materials mined depending on the location of a given site.
Copper and silver were two of the most commonly mined materials.
In 1893, silver prices dropped, but the town's economy continued to thrive due to its copper production.
Walkerville's economic success continued until 1918 when the end of World War I caused copper prices to drop as well.
In 2015, nearly all of the town's many mines are abandoned.
Some of these sites have become very dangerous and plans are being made to restore or remove them.
