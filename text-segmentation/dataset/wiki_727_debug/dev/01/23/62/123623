The first business in Plentywood opened in 1900, and a post office was established two years later.
The city incorporated in 1912, following the arrival of a Great Northern Railway branch line that eventually ran from Bainville to Opheim.
Local folklore suggests that the name of the nearby Plentywood Creek, after which the city was named, comes from a search for firewood.
One day, according to the story, a group of cowboys watched in exasperation as the chuck wagon cook attempted to start a fire with damp buffalo chips.
Finally, in frustration, Dutch Henry said, "If you’ll go 2 miles up this creek, you’ll find plenty wood."
