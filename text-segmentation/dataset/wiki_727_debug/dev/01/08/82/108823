========,2,History.
The portion of the territory of the Saybrook Colony east of the Connecticut River was set off as the plantation of East Saybrook in February 1665.
This area included present-day Lyme, Old Lyme, and the western part of East Lyme.
In 1667, the Connecticut General Court formally recognized the East Saybrook plantation as the town of Lyme, named after Lyme Regis, a coastal town in Southern England.
The eastern portion of Lyme (bordering the town of Waterford) separated from Lyme and became East Lyme in 1823, and the southern portion of Lyme (along Long Island Sound) separated as South Lyme in 1855 (renamed to Old Lyme in 1857).
These two changes were consistent with the then-existing laws in the state of Connecticut.
