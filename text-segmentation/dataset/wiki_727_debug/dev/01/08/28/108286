========,1,preface.
Alpaugh is a census-designated place (CDP) in Tulare County, California, United States.
The population was 1,026 at the 2010 census, up from 761 at the 2000 census.
It is named for John Alpaugh, one of the officers of the Home Extension Colony which reclaimed (or land speculated on) the land the town is built on.
========,2,Geography.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land.
The site is located on the historic shoreline of Tulare Lake, once the largest freshwater lake in the USA outside of the Great lakes.
Other towns built on its historic shores include Lemoore and Kettleman City.
========,2,History.
Alpaugh's location (once also called Hog Island, Root Island, and Atwell's Island) was once either on an island or a narrow peninsula near the south end of the huge and rich Tulare Lake.
A.J.
Atwell was a Visalia attorney (and newspaper owner) who raised hogs on the island.
The lake at different times supported a very large Indian population, a commercial fishery, herds of tule elk, countless game birds, and much more.
The island was a regular port of call for the lake's commercial ferry service.
The last time the lake was brim full and overflowed into the San Joaquin River to the sea was 1878.
Water diversions of its source waters have since caused the lake to shrink into the tiny remnant of today.
Local efforts are underway (in 2011) to increase the lake's size for water storage and wildlife.
Los Angeles real estate developers, "the California Home Extension", promoted, developed or founded Alpaugh, nearby Wasco, and several other California towns.
It has also been referred to as "W.H.
Wilber's Second Home Extension Coloney [that] purchased eight-thousand acres of land surrounding [Alpaugh]."
Los Angeles newspaper articles of the time explained that they were not the original landowners.
"The California Home Extension association does not represent land owners; it has no lands of its own for sale.'."
On 17 December 1905, an article headlined "BUY IN TOWN OF ALPAUGH, CAL" ran in the Los Angeles Herald.
Subheadline: "PURCHASE OF 11,000 ACRES BY COLONISTS."
It says in part: 
Eight Hundred Families to Settle in the Beautiful and Productive San Joaquin Valley for Homes and Profit <br> <br>
Alpaugh is the name of the new town In Tulare county, that was selected by the board of directors of the California Home Extension association and was visited by 200 members last week, all of whom are delighted with the choice of their governing board.
<br> On 21 January 1906 — Page 19, an article headlined "ALL ABOARD FOR ALPAUGH" ran in the Los Angeles Herald.
Subheadline: "Day Fixed for Distribution of Town Lots to Enthusiastic Colonists" It says: 
The acreage lots will not be distributed until a few days afterwards, and another circular will be sent out from the Home Extension office as soon as the Tulare county surveyor sends down the official map.
It was decided best to get the town lot distribution out of the way of the acreage distribution, as the latter is likely to take up a whole day.
<br> <br>  The town lot distribution will also allow the merchants, hotel and restaurant men to go ahead and erect accommodations on the lots they select and have things in good shape for an orderly and well arranged incoming of the acreage holders.
There are, about thirty or forty people on the grounds at Alpaugh and they want to select their lots so that they can abandon their temporary tent camp and put up good accommodations for the people soon to come in.
<br>  This colonization plan has been done to attract attention to California.
The first colony established by the association at Clark City, now Greenfield, in Monterey county, has rapidly grown in population and substantial improvements.
There are now many business houses and over sixty cottages erected at Greenfield.
<br> <br> Alpaugh colonists assert that their town will boom at once, and that the Gordon Harris vegetable concentrating industry will be an important factor in the line of speedy development.
Many colonists have already completed arrangements to go to Alpaugh soon after the lots are distributed.
However, just one week before, that newspaper printed this, headline <br> NEW INDUSTRY AT ALPAUGH 
Colonists Will Find a Profitable Market at Home for AII Their Products <br> <br>
The California Home Extension association has purchased a fertile tract of land in Tulare county, comprising 11,000 acres [17.2 sq.mi.
], in the center of which the town of Alpaugh is to be located.
<br> <br> The Second Home Extension "Produce" company has been organized with a capital stock of $50,000.
"The purpose of this company" is to establish at once a fully equipped factory plant where concentrated vegetables and fruit products will be manufactured.
This will create a market for all vegetables and fruits raised during the year by the colonists...
In 1920 and 1921 both oil and large gas fields were found near Alpaugh.
