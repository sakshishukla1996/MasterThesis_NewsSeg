========,1,preface.
Hiawatha (Ioway: "Hári Wáta" pronounced ) is the largest city and county seat of Brown County, Kansas, United States.
As of the 2010 census, the city population was 3,172.
========,2,History.
Hiawatha was founded in 1857, making it one of the oldest towns in the state.
John M. Coe, John P. Wheller, and Thomas J. Drummond were instrumental in organizing the city, and the site was staked out February 17, 1857.
B.L.
Rider reportedly was responsible for naming Hiawatha, taking the young Indian's name from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem, "The Song of Hiawatha".
Hiawatha became the Brown County Seat in 1858, and the first school opened in 1870.
The main street was designated Oregon Street after the Oregon Trail.
Parallel streets north of it were named after Indian tribes north of the Trail, and streets south carried tribal names of those south of the Trail.
Hiawatha is named after a poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow called "The Song of Hiawatha".
In the poem is legendary Onondaga and Mohawk Indian leader Hiawatha.
Adjacent to the former Ioway-Sac reservation and the present-day Ioway Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska, Hiawatha is called "Hári Wáta" in Ioway, meaning "I am looking far away".
This name may be the result of choosing Ioway words that sound like the English name.
It has nothing to do with the Onondaga-Mohawk leader.
The city is also home to the longest running continuous Halloween parade in the nation, starting in 1914.
According to The "New York Times" in 2012, "the cartoonist Bob Montana inked the original likenesses of Archie and his pals and plopped them in an idyllic Midwestern community named Riverdale because Mr. [John] Goldwater, a New Yorker, had fond memories of time spent in Hiawatha, Kan." Goldwater had hitchhiked to the community at the age of 17 and started working at the Hiawatha Daily World.

***LIST***.
The Davis Memorial is a monument in the Mount Hope Cemetery, built by John Milburn Davis in honor of his wife Sarah after her death.
Begun soon after her death in 1930 and completed in 1934, the monument consists of statues of the couple and a small shelter, carved from Italian marble.
Its cost (approximately $200,000) led many in the community to criticize Davis for his free spending during the Great Depression.
Today, the monument benefits the community financially because of the thousands of tourists who visit it.
The memorial was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.

========,3,Mascot.
In December 2000, the Hiawatha USD 415 School District voted 4-3 to eliminate the American Indian mascots from the schools.
The high school had the nickname 'Redskins', similar to 'Indians' when the school was in its early years.
The middle school was the 'Warriors' and the elementary school, the 'Braves'.
The District received much praise for its transition, including the National Congress of American Indians and organizations as far away as Washington, D.C. After narrowing down many potential new nicknames, the high school decided to retain its red pride, renaming itself the 'Red Hawks'.
The middle school obtained the name 'Hawks' and the elementary school, 'Junior Hawks'.
Hiawatha avoided potential lawsuits and controversy by making a quick move to a nickname from which racism cannot be inferred.
