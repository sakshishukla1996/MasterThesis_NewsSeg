========,1,preface.
Keep the Faith is the fifth studio album by American rock band Bon Jovi, released on November 3, 1992 by Mercury Records.
It is the last album to feature original bass guitarist Alec John Such, before his dismissal from the band in 1994.
It was also Bon Jovi's first album since 1985's "7800° Fahrenheit" not to be produced by Bruce Fairbairn.
It is the first album to have a title track.
The album was produced by Bob Rock and was recorded at the Little Mountain Sound Studios in Vancouver, Canada.
"Keep the Faith" represents the beginning of a new chapter in the history of Bon Jovi, marking a change of both the band's image and sound.
Moving away from their early glam metal roots in previous albums, it introduced a more "rock n roll" driven groove to Bon Jovi's sound.
The album turned away from heavy drums and wild guitar solos, but instead introduced a new sound of Bon Jovi which consisted of piano ballads and long epic guitar solos.
"Keep The Faith" peaked at number five on the US "Billboard" 200 chart while topping the charts in the UK and Australia.
The album was certified double-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
The album produced several hits for the band, including "Keep the Faith", "Bed of Roses" and "In These Arms".
The album was ranked No.
21 on "Kerrang!
'"s "100 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die" and in 2006, the album featured in the "Classic Rock & Metal Hammer's" "The 200 Greatest Albums of the 90's".
========,2,Background.
Following the completion of the New Jersey tour, the band went on hiatus.
During their time off, Jon Bon Jovi wrote the soundtrack for "Young Guns II", which was released in 1990 as the "Blaze of Glory" album and Richie Sambora released his first solo album called "Stranger in This Town".
By this time, Jon Bon Jovi fired his longtime manager, Doc McGhee and created Bon Jovi Management.
Jon Bon Jovi decided to take on a larger role, and more responsibilities within the band.
In October 1991 the band went to the Caribbean island of St. Thomas to discuss plans for the future; the band's internal problems were solved and they were ready to have a go at a comeback.
========,2,Recording and production.
In January 1992 the band headed to Little Mountain Studios in Vancouver.
They spent seven months making the album with Bob Rock producing.
Originally the band had approached Bruce Fairbairn to produce the album who produced "Slippery When Wet" and "New Jersey", but he was working on Aerosmith's "Get a Grip" album at the time.
Most of the recording was done in Vancouver, although a couple of tracks were laid down in Los Angeles along with some over-dubs.
According to an interview with Jon Bon Jovi, the album's original title was to be "Revenge".
Of the thirty songs written for the album, couple were written with Desmond Child and a couple were by David Bryan, with the rest being made up of Jon Bon Jovi/Richie Sambora compositions and those written solely by Jon Bon Jovi.
14 songs made it to the final cut.
Jon Bon Jovi alone wrote most of the album because, as he says, "This was my way of trying to keep things together."
According to Richie Sambora, his own input had to be limited, because he'd been supporting his solo album.
Before the band reunited in the studio, Jon Bon Jovi spent the summer of 1991 in anonymity, riding his bike in places like Arizona, gaining experiences that inspired him to write "Dry County" and "Bed of Roses".
He later commented "It would never have been possible [for me] to write songs like "Bed of Roses" or "Dry County" five years ago."
========,2,Release and reception.
"Keep the Faith" was released on November 3, 1992.
To promote "Keep The Faith", Bon Jovi returned to their roots playing a few dates at the small New Jersey clubs where they had started their career.
The band appeared on "MTV Unplugged", but that was different from the other episodes of the MTV Unplugged series.
The performance captures Bon Jovi in an intimate, "in the round" experience, performing acoustic and electric renditions of classic hits (Bon Jovi and non-Bon Jovi tracks) and new material from "Keep the Faith".
The concert was released commercially in 1993 as "".
========,2,Commercial performance.
In the US, "Keep the Faith" debuted at number five on the "Billboard" 200 Top Albums on November 1992 while peaking at number one in the UK and Australia.
Six singles were released from "Keep the Faith" between November 1992 and April 1994, with four singles issued in the United States, and two others released only outside the US.
But the album sold a less of a fraction from their previous predecessors of Slippery When Wet and New Jersey due to the pop and music culture alternations by having Nirvana and Pearl Jam on the scene and Gangsta rap hitting the airways.
But the album did incredibly well in Europe, Austrailia, and the U.K. At the end of 1993, Keep The Faith sold 13 million copies worldwide.

========,3,Singles.
The album’s first single, “Keep The Faith”, was released on October 1992 a month before the album.
On the US Billboard charts, the song topped the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart while reaching number twenty nine on the "Billboard" Hot 100; elsewhere, it reached top ten on the singles charts in UK, Ireland, Canada, Switzerland, Germany, Sweden, Norway, The Netherlands and Australia.
“Bed of Roses” was released as the second single.
On the US Billboard charts, the song reached number ten on the Hot 100.
Elsewhere, it reached number two in Canada and number ten in Australia and Germany.
Three more commercial singles were released in 1993.
"In These Arms", released in May, reached number six in Canada, number nine in the UK, and number ten in Australia and Ireland.
It also hit the Top 40 in the US "Billboard" Hot 100.
“I'll Sleep When I'm Dead”, released in August, reached number seventeen in the UK.
“I Believe” was released only in Europe and Australia; it reached number eleven on the UK Singles Chart in October.
In April 1994, the album's last single, “Dry County”, was released only in Europe and Australia; it reached number nine on the UK Singles Chart.
By the end of 1993, "Keep the Faith" had sold eight million copies worldwide.
In October 1994, the album was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
"Keep the Faith" is the third most-represented album in Bon Jovi’s concert setlists behind "Slippery When Wet" and "New Jersey".
This representation is due entirely to the singles, of which “I’ll Sleep When I’m Dead” and the title track have been live staples.
Of the pure album tracks, “Blame It on the Love of Rock and Roll” and “I Want You” were each only played once during 1993, whilst “If I Was Your Mother” was performed live only twice during the Keep the Faith Tour and not subsequently.
“Little Bit of Soul” has appeared live only twice during special radio sessions and Bon Jovi have performed “Fear” live only six times, all during the French and Spanish legs of the album’s supporting tour in April 1993.
