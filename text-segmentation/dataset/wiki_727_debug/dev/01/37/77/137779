Originally named Jerusalem by English colonists, the town was given its present name in 1888.

This town was formed in 1791 on the north shore of the Nottoway River, on a parcel of ten acres (40,000 m²) beside the courthouse.
In 1831, the town became notorious as the site of the trials and subsequent executions of Nat Turner and some of his cohort who had planned a major slave rebellion.
According to a letter written by Solon Borland to the governor of North Carolina, the village was a small hamlet of approximately 175 people, with only three stores, one saddler, one carriage maker, two hotels, two attorneys and two physicians.
The town was the boyhood home of Confederate Major General William Mahone, whose father Fielding Mahone ran a tavern.
General George H. Thomas, "Rock of Chickamauga", and a native of Southampton County, was a Union general and graduate of the United States Military Academy, likely visited his uncle James Rochelle here.
Rochelle was clerk of court for Southampton County, and lived three houses from Mahone's Tavern.
