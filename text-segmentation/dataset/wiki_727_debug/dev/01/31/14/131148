The township derives its name from the Palace of Versailles.
========,2,History.
North Versailles Township was formed September 18, 1869, by a division of (the original) Versailles Township into North and South Versailles townships.
Versailles Township was one of the original seven townships of Allegheny County formed in 1788 from Westmoreland County.
Additionally, the land which encompasses the present day North Versailles Township was disputed territory between Pennsylvania and Virginia, which claimed the area as part of Yohogania County of the District of West Augusta.
The territory designated in 1788 as Versailles Township now contains the townships of North Versailles and South Versailles; the boroughs of White Oak, East McKeesport, Wall, Versailles, and portions of Wilmerding and Trafford; as well as the major portion (excluding 10th ward) of the city of McKeesport.
North Versailles was further divided with the formation of the boroughs of East McKeesport (1893), Wall (1904), and portions of the boroughs of Wilmerding (1890) and Trafford (1904).
The section of Wilmerding on the north side of Turtle Creek was originally part of the former Patton Township, and the majority of Trafford is situated in Westmoreland County.
An area of North Versailles (Allequippa Grove, later known as North McKeesport and Highland Grove) was annexed by the city of McKeesport.
Early villages and population centers in North Versailles included Port Perry, Saltsburgh and Allequippa Grove along the Monongahela River; Pleasant Hill near to what is now East McKeesport; Point Pleasant located near the present intersections of Route 30 and McKee and Naser roads; and Stewart's Station, Spring Hill, Mosside Station, Wall Station, and Wilmerding Station along Turtle Creek, a tributary of the Monongahela River.
North Versailles has a number of named neighborhoods, including the following which roughly correspond to the township's seven wards:

At one time, North Versailles was served by eight volunteer fire departments.
Each ward was served by one department, with the exception of Ward 3, which had both the Sunset and South Wilmerding VFDs.
Ward 4 and 6's fire departments were the Green Valley VFD and Dixon VFD respectively.
Currently, three fire departments serve the township.
Crestas VFD (with one station) serves Crestas Terrace, West Wilmerding VFD serves west wilmerding.
The remaining five wards of the township are served by the Fire Department of North Versailles (FDNV) with three stations.
The stations are respectively the former Sunset-Central VFD, Green Valley VFD, and Dixon Hollow VFD.
The North Versailles Township Police department also patrols the borough of Wilmerding.
========,2,Schools.
North Versailles, East McKeesport, Wilmerding, and Wall consolidated school systems in the early 1960s to form the East Allegheny School District.
East Allegheny High School (the Wildcats – 1969) is situated off Route 48 (Jack's Run Road) near the intersection of U.S. Route 30.
Green Valley School (1955) is the only surviving school of the former North Versailles School District which included (but is not limited to) the following other schools during the township's history:
***LIST***.
Prior to the formation of the East Allegheny School District, North Versailles high school age students were able to choose to go to one of several high schools in other districts including: East McKeesport High School (the Rams), Westinghouse Memorial High School (the Wildcats), Turtle Creek High School (the Creekers), McKeesport Area High School (the Tigers), and East Pittsburgh High School (the Shamrocks).
At the formation of the East Allegheny School District (known as Westinghouse Valley Area Schools from 1962 to 1966), Westinghouse Memorial High School became the district's official high school until the building of East Allegheny High School in 1969.
The former East McKeesport High School was transformed into a Junior High serving East McKeesport, Wilmerding, Wall and certain portions of North Versailles near East McKeesport.
Park Terrace Junior High (1955—the Bobcats) served the township.
During the 1968–69 school year, Park Terrace was designated a middle school serving all seventh and eighth graders in the district and East McKeesport served only 9th grade students for this one year; it would serve other populations until its closure in 1982.
Neither school building exists today.
The North Versailles Police Department currently staffs police officers in East Allegheny High School and Logan Middle School.
