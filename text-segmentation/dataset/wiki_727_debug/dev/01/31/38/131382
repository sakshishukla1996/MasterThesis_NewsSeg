Maxatawny Township was served by the Berks-Lehigh Regional Police.
On April 16, 2012, the Berks-Lehigh Regional Police announced it was disbanding at the end of 2012.
On December 28, 2012, it was announced Maxatawny Township would form its own police department.
The new department would be led by one officer for the time being who would be in charge of ordinance enforcement and traffic studies, with the Pennsylvania State Police handling emergency calls and arrests in the township.
The ordinance that was passed put the framework in place for a department to be created in the future.
In May 2013, supervisors mailed a survey to residents to gauge whether they supported funding a township police department, at a total cost near $2 million.
Out of 1,622 surveys mailed out, 1,040 were returned, and over 80% of the residents who responded voted no, leaving the township's police coverage to the state police for the foreseeable future.
