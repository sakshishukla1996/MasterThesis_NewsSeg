========,2,History.
Holdenville traces its origin to a Creek settlement called "echo", which means deer in English.
George B. Fentress operated a general store there.
A post office called "Fentress" opened there on May 24, 1895.
During the same year, the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad (CO&G), later the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway, built a line from McAlester to Oklahoma City.
On November 15, 1895, the Fentress post office was renamed Holdenville, in honor of J. F. Holden, an employee of the CO&G.
The town of Holdenville was incorporated by order of the U.S. District Court at Muskogee.

Red was elected mayor at the first municipal election, held December 27, 1898.

The Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad was constructed in the 1890s from Arkansas to Indian Territory.
Between 1895 and 1897, the construction passed through the Creek Nation.
During this period, a railroad camp was set up to service the railroad construction.
The railroad workers called the camp "Holden" in honor of J.F.
Holden, the Auditor and Traffic Manager of Choctaw, Oklahoma, and Gulf Railroad.
In 1895, a request was delivered to the U.S. Congress to establish a post office in Holden.
The request was rejected because the name was too similar to another post office called "Holder."

In 1898, settlers petitioned Indian Territory to incorporate Holdenville as a town.
A hearing was granted and on November 14, 1898, Holdenville was incorporated as part of Indian Territory.

This time, Holdenville won the election.
