========,1,preface.
The University of Manchester is a public research university in Manchester, England, formed in 2004 by the merger of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology and the Victoria University of Manchester.
The University of Manchester is a red brick university, a product of the civic university movement of the late-19th century.
The main campus is south of Manchester city centre on Oxford Road.
In , the university had students and 10,400 staff, making it the largest university in the UK (out of including the Open University), and the largest single-site university.
The university had a consolidated income of £987.2 million in 2015–16, of which £273.5 million was from research grants and contracts.
It has the third largest endowment of any university in England, after the universities of Cambridge and Oxford.
It is a member of the worldwide Universities Research Association, the Russell Group of British research universities and the N8 Group.
The University of Manchester is ranked 34th in the world and 7th in the UK by QS World University Rankings 2018.
In the 2015 Academic Ranking of World Universities, Manchester was ranked 35th in the world and 5th in the UK.
It is ranked joint 55th in the world and 8th in the UK in the 2016 Times Higher Education World University Rankings.
In an employability ranking published by Emerging in 2015, where CEOs and chairmen were asked to select the top universities they recruited from, Manchester was placed 24th in the world and 5th nationally.
The Global Employability University Ranking conducted by THE places Manchester at 27th worldwide and 10th in Europe, ahead of academic powerhouses such as Cornell, UPenn and LSE.
In the 2014 Research Excellence Framework, Manchester came fifth in terms of research power and seventeenth for grade point average quality when including specialist institutions.
More students try to gain entry than to any other university in the country, with more than 55,000 applications for undergraduate courses in 2014 resulting in 6.5 applicants for every available place.
According to the 2017 High Fliers Report, Manchester is the second most targeted university by the largest number of leading graduate employers in the UK.
The university owns and operates major cultural assets such as the Manchester Museum, Whitworth Art Gallery, John Rylands Library and Jodrell Bank Observatory and its Grade I listed Lovell Telescope.
The University of Manchester has 25 Nobel laureates among its past and present students and staff, the fourth-highest number of any single university in the United Kingdom.
Four Nobel laureates are currently among its staff – more than any other British university.
========,2,History.
========,3,Origins.
The University of Manchester traces its roots to the formation of the Mechanics' Institute (later UMIST) in 1824, and its heritage is linked to Manchester's pride in being the world's first industrial city.
The English chemist John Dalton, together with Manchester businessmen and industrialists, established the Mechanics' Institute to ensure that workers could learn the basic principles of science.
John Owens, a textile merchant, left a bequest of £96,942 in 1846 (around £5.6 million in 2005 prices) to found a college to educate men on non-sectarian lines.
His trustees established Owens College in 1851 in a house on the corner of Quay Street and Byrom Street which had been the home of the philanthropist Richard Cobden, and subsequently housed Manchester County Court.
The locomotive designer, Charles Beyer became a governor of the college and was the largest single donor to the college extension fund, which raised the money to move to a new site and construct the main building now known as the John Owens building.
He also campaigned and helped fund the engineering chair, the first applied science department in the north of England.
He left the college the equivalent of £10 million in his will in 1876, at a time when it was in great financial difficulty.
Beyer funded the total cost of construction of the Beyer building to house the biology and geology departments.
His will also funded Engineering chairs and the Beyer Professor of Applied mathematics.
The university has a rich German heritage.
The Owens College Extension Movement based their plans after a tour of mainly German universities and polytechnics.
Manchester mill owner, Thomas Ashton, chairman of the extension movement had studied at Heidelberg University.
Sir Henry Roscoe also studied at Heidelberg under Robert Bunsen and they collaborated for many years on research projects.
Roscoe promoted the German style of research led teaching that became the role model for the redbrick universities.
Charles Beyer studied at Dresden Academy Polytechnic.
There were many Germans on the staff, including Carl Schorlemmer, Britain's first chair in organic chemistry, and Arthur Schuster , professor of Physics.
There was even a German chapel on the campus.
In 1873 the college moved to new premises on Oxford Road, Chorlton-on-Medlock and from 1880 it was a constituent college of the federal Victoria University.
The university was established and granted a Royal Charter in 1880 becoming England's first civic university; it was renamed the Victoria University of Manchester in 1903 and absorbed Owens College the following year.
By 1905, the institutions were large and active forces.
The Municipal College of Technology, forerunner of UMIST, was the Victoria University of Manchester's Faculty of Technology while continuing in parallel as a technical college offering advanced courses of study.
Although UMIST achieved independent university status in 1955, the universities continued to work together.
However, in the late-20th century, formal connections between the university and UMIST diminished and in 1994 most of the remaining institutional ties were severed as new legislation allowed UMIST to become an autonomous university with powers to award its own degrees.
A decade later the development was reversed.
The Victoria University of Manchester and the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology agreed to merge into a single institution in March 2003.
Before the merger, Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST counted 23 Nobel Prize winners amongst their former staff and students.
Manchester has traditionally been strong in the sciences; it is where the nuclear nature of the atom was discovered by Ernest Rutherford, and the world's first stored-program computer was built at the university.
Notable scientists associated with the university include physicists Ernest Rutherford, Osborne Reynolds, Niels Bohr, James Chadwick, Arthur Schuster, Hans Geiger, Ernest Marsden and Balfour Stewart.
Contributions in other fields such as mathematics were made by Paul Erdős, Horace Lamb and Alan Turing and in philosophy by Samuel Alexander, Ludwig Wittgenstein and Alasdair MacIntyre.
The author Anthony Burgess, Pritzker Prize and RIBA Stirling Prize-winning architect Norman Foster and composer Peter Maxwell Davies all attended, or worked at, Manchester.
========,3,2004 to present.
The current University of Manchester was officially launched on 1 October 2004 when Queen Elizabeth handed over its Royal Charter.
The university was named the "Sunday Times" University of the Year in 2006 after winning the inaugural "Times Higher Education Supplement" University of the Year prize in 2005.
The founding president and vice-chancellor of the new university was Alan Gilbert, former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Melbourne, who retired at the end of the 2009–2010 academic year.
His successor was Dame Nancy Rothwell, who had held a chair in physiology at the university since 1994.
One of the university's aims stated in the "Manchester 2015 Agenda" is to be one of the top 25 universities in the world, following on from Alan Gilbert's aim to "establish it by 2015 among the 25 strongest research universities in the world on commonly accepted criteria of research excellence and performance".
In 2011, four Nobel laureates were on its staff: Andre Geim, Konstantin Novoselov, Sir John Sulston and Joseph E. Stiglitz.
The EPSRC announced in February 2012 the formation of the National Graphene Institute.
The University of Manchester is the "single supplier invited to submit a proposal for funding the new £45m institute, £38m of which will be provided by the government" – (EPSRC & Technology Strategy Board).
In 2013, an additional £23 million of funding from European Regional Development Fund was awarded to the institute taking investment to £61 million.
In August 2012, it was announced that the university's Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences had been chosen to be the "hub" location for a new BP International Centre for Advanced Materials, as part of a $100 million initiative to create industry-changing materials.
The centre will be aimed at advancing fundamental understanding and use of materials across a variety of oil and gas industrial applications and will be modelled on a hub and spoke structure, with the hub located at Manchester, and the spokes based at the University of Cambridge, Imperial College London, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
========,2,Campus.
The university's main site contains most of its facilities and is often referred to as "campus", however Manchester is not a campus university as the concept is commonly understood.
It is centrally located in the city and its buildings are integrated into the fabric of Manchester, with non-university buildings and major roads between.
The campus occupies an area shaped roughly like a boot: the foot of which is aligned roughly south-west to north-east and is joined to the broader southern part of the boot by an area of overlap between former UMIST and former VUM buildings; it comprises two parts:
***LIST***.
The names are not officially recognised by the university, but are commonly used, including in parts of its website and roughly correspond to the campuses of the old UMIST and Victoria University respectively.
Fallowfield Campus is the main residential campus in Fallowfield, approximately 2 miles (3 km) south of the main site.
There are other university buildings across the city and the wider region, such as Jodrell Bank Observatory in Cheshire and One Central Park in Moston, a collaboration between the university and other partners which offers office space for start-up firms and venues for conferences and workshops,
========,3,Major projects.
Following the merger, the university embarked on a £600 million programme of capital investment, to deliver eight new buildings and 15 major refurbishment projects by 2010, partly financed by a sale of unused assets.
These include:
***LIST***.
========,3,Old Quadrangle.
The buildings around the Old Quadrangle date from the time of Owens College, and were designed in a Gothic style by Alfred Waterhouse and his son Paul Waterhouse.
The first to be built was the John Owens Building (1873), formerly the Main Building; the others were added over the next thirty years.
Today, the museum continues to occupy part of one side, including the tower.
The grand setting of the Whitworth Hall is used for the conferment of degrees, and part of the old Christie Library (1898) now houses Christie's Bistro.
The remainder of the buildings house administrative departments.
The less easily accessed Rear Quadrangle, dating mostly from 1873, is older in its completed form than the Old Quadrangle.
========,3,Contact.
Contact stages modern live performance for all ages, and participatory workshops primarily for young people aged 13 to 30.
The building on Devas Street was completed in 1999 incorporating parts of its 1960s predecessor.
It has a unique energy-efficient ventilation system, using its high towers to naturally ventilate the building without the use of air conditioning.
The colourful and curvaceous interior houses three performance spaces, a lounge bar and "Hot Air", a reactive public artwork in the foyer.
========,3,Chancellors Hotel and Conference Centre.
The Chancellors Hotel & Conference Centre was built around The Firs, a house built in 1850 for Sir Joseph Whitworth by Edward Walters, who also designed Manchester's Free Trade Hall.
Whitworth used the house as a social, political and business base, entertaining radicals such as John Bright, Richard Cobden, William Forster and T.H.
Huxley at the time of the Reform Bill of 1867.
Whitworth, credited with raising the art of machine-tool building to a previously unknown level, supported the Mechanics Institute – the birthplace of UMIST – and was a founder the Manchester School of Design.
Whilst living there, Whitworth used land at the rear (now the site of the University's botanical glasshouses) for testing his "Whitworth rifle".
In 1882, The Firs was leased to C.P.
Scott, editor of the Manchester Guardian and after Scott's death became the property of Owens College.
It was the Vice-Chancellor's residence until 1991.
The house now forms the western wing of the Chancellors Hotel & Conference Centre.
The eastern wing houses the circular Flowers Theatre, six conference rooms and most of the hotel's bedrooms.
========,2,Organisation and administration.
========,3,Faculties and schools.
The University of Manchester was divided into four faculties, but from 1 August 2016 it was restructured into three faculties, each sub-divided into schools.
On 25 June 2015 Manchester University announced the results of a review of the position of life sciences as a separate faculty.
As a result of this review the Faculty of Life Sciences was to be dismantled, most of its personnel to be incorporated into a single medical/biological faculty, with a substantial minority being incorporated into a science and engineering faculty.
========,4,Faculty of Biology Medicine and Health.
The faculty is divided into the School of Biological Sciences, the School of Medical Sciences and the School of Health Sciences.
Biological Sciences have been taught at Manchester as far back as the foundation of Owens College in 1851.
At UMIST, biological teaching and research began in 1959, with the creation of a Biochemistry department.
The present school, though unitary for teaching, is divided into a number of sections for research purposes.
The medical college was established in 1874 and is one of the largest in the country, with more than 400 medical students trained in each clinical year and more than 350 students in the pre-clinical/phase 1 years.
The university is a founding partner of the Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, established to focus high-end healthcare research in Greater Manchester.
In 1883, a department of pharmacy was established at the university and, in 1904, Manchester became the first British university to offer an honours degree in the subject.
The School of Pharmacy benefits from links with Manchester Royal Infirmary and Wythenshawe and Hope hospitals providing its undergraduate students with hospital experience.
The Pharmacy School's Centre for Pharmacy Postgraduate Education (CPPE) is considered a centre of excellence.
Manchester Dental School was rated the country's best dental school by "Times Higher Education" in 2010 and 2011 and it is one of the best funded because of its emphasis on research and enquiry-based learning approach.
The university has obtained multimillion-pound backing to maintain its high standard of dental education.
The University Dental Hospital of Manchester is part of Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.
It was established in 1884 in association with the School of Medicine at Owens College.
In 1905 the university established a degree and a diploma in dental surgery (first awarded in 1909 and 1908 respectively).
========,4,Faculty of Science and Engineering.
The Faculty of Science and Engineering comprises the schools of "Chemical Engineering and Analytical Science";"Chemistry"; "Computer Science"; "Earth and Environmental Science"; "Physics and Astronomy"; "Electrical and Electronic Engineering"; "Materials"; "Mathematics"; and "Mechanical, Aerospace and Civil Engineering".
The Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics comprises the university's astronomical academic staff in Manchester and Jodrell Bank Observatory on rural land near Goostrey, about ten miles (16 km) west of Macclesfield away from the lights of Greater Manchester.
The observatory's Lovell Telescope, named after Sir Bernard Lovell, a professor at the Victoria University of Manchester who first proposed the telescope.
Constructed in the 1950s, it is the third largest fully movable radio telescope in the world.
It has played an important role in the research of quasars, pulsars and gravitational lenses, and in confirming Einstein's theory of General Relativity.
A £1.2 billion Square Kilometre Array with 50 times more sensitivity and the ability to search space 10,000 times faster than any other telescope in existence will become operational in 2020.
========,4,Faculty of Humanities.
The Faculty of Humanities includes the School of Arts, Languages and Cultures (incorporating Archaeology; Art History & Visual Studies; Classics and Ancient History; Drama; English and American Studies; History; Linguistics; Modern Languages; Museology; Music; Religions and Theology and the University Language Centre) and the Schools of Combined Studies; Education; Environment and Development; Architecture; Law; Social Sciences and the Manchester Business School.
The Faculty of Humanities also jointly administers the Manchester School of Architecture (MSA) in conjunction with Manchester Metropolitan University and MSA students are classified as students of both universities.
Additionally, the faculty comprises a number of research institutes: the Centre for New Writing, the Institute for Social Change, the Brooks World Poverty Institute, Humanitarian and Conflict Response Institute, the Manchester Institute for Innovation Research, the Research Institute for Cosmopolitan Cultures, the Centre for Chinese Studies, the Institute for Development Policy and Management, the Centre for Equity in Education and the Sustainable Consumption Institute.
========,3,Finances.
In the financial year ending 31 July 2011, the University of Manchester had a total income of £808.58 million (2009/10 – £787.9 million) and total expenditure of £754.51 million (2009/10 – £764.55 million).
Key sources of income included £247.28 million from tuition fees and education contracts (2009/10 – £227.75 million), £203.22 million from funding body grants (2009/10 – £209.02 million), £196.24 million from research grants and contracts (2009/10 – £194.6 million) and £14.84 million from endowment and investment income (2009/10 – £11.38 million).
During the 2010/11 financial year the University of Manchester had a capital expenditure of £57.42 million (2009/10 – £37.95 million).
At year end the University of Manchester had endowments of £158.7 million (2009/10 – £144.37 million) and total net assets of £731.66 million (2009/10 – £677.12 million).
========,2,Academic profile.
The University of Manchester has the largest number of full-time students in the UK, unless the University of London's colleges are counted as a single university.
It teaches more academic subjects than any other British university.
Well-known figures among the university's current academic staff include computer scientist Steve Furber, economist Richard Nelson, novelist Jeanette Winterson (who succeeded Colm Tóibín in 2012) and biochemist Sir John Sulston, Nobel laureate of 2002.
========,3,Research.
The University of Manchester is a major centre for research and a member of the Russell Group of leading British research universities.
In the first national assessment of higher education research since the university's founding, the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise, the university was ranked third in terms of research power (after Cambridge and Oxford) and sixth for grade point average quality among multi-faculty institutions (eighth when including specialist institutions) Manchester has the fifth largest research income of any British university (after Oxford, Imperial, UCL and Cambridge).
(these five universities have been informally referred to as the "golden diamond" of research-intensive UK institutions).
Manchester has a strong record in terms of securing funding from the three main UK research councils, EPSRC, MRC and BBSRC, being ranked fifth, seventh and first respectively.
In addition, the university is one of the richest in the UK in terms of income and interest from endowments: a recent estimate placed it third, surpassed only by Oxford and Cambridge.
Despite recent severe cuts in higher education Manchester remains at second place behind Oxford nationally in terms of total recurrent grants allocated by the HEFCE.
Historically, Manchester has been linked with high scientific achievement: the university and its constituent former institutions combined had 25 Nobel laureates among their students and staff, the third largest number of any single university in the United Kingdom (after Oxford and Cambridge) and the ninth largest of any university in Europe.
Furthermore, according to an academic poll two of the top ten discoveries by university academics and researchers were made at the university (namely the first working computer and the contraceptive pill).
The university currently employs four Nobel Prize winners amongst its staff, more than any other in the UK.
The Langworthy Professorship, an endowed chair at the University's School of Physics and Astronomy, has been historically given to a long line of academic luminaries, including Ernest Rutherford (1907–19), Lawrence Bragg (1919–37), Patrick Blackett (1937–53) and more recently Konstantin Novoselov, all of whom have won the Nobel Prize.
In 2013 Manchester was given the Regius Professorship in Physics, the only one of its kind in the UK; the current holder is Andre Geim.
========,3,University of Manchester Library.
The University of Manchester Library is the largest non-legal deposit library in the UK and the third-largest academic library after those of Oxford and Cambridge.
It has the largest collection of electronic resources of any library in the UK.
The John Rylands Library, founded in memory of John Rylands by his wife Enriqueta Augustina Rylands as an independent institution, is situated in a Victorian Gothic building on Deansgate, in the city centre.
It houses an important collection of historic books and other printed materials, manuscripts, including archives and papyri.
The papyri are in ancient languages and include the oldest extant New Testament document, Rylands Library Papyrus P52, commonly known as the "St John Fragment".
In April 2007 the Deansgate site reopened to readers and the public after major improvements and renovations, including the construction of the pitched roof originally intended and a new wing.
========,3,Collections.
========,4,Manchester Museum.
The Manchester Museum holds nearly 4.25 million items sourced from many parts of the world.
The collections include butterflies and carvings from India, birds and bark-cloth from the Pacific, live frogs and ancient pottery from America, fossils and native art from Australia, mammals and ancient Egyptian craftsmanship from Africa, plants, coins and minerals from Europe, art from past civilisations of the Mediterranean, and beetles, armour and archery from Asia.
In November 2004, the museum acquired a cast of a fossilised "Tyrannosaurus rex" called "Stan".
The museum's first collections were assembled in 1821 by the Manchester Society of Natural History, and subsequently expanded by the addition of the collections of Manchester Geological Society.
Due to the society's financial difficulties and on the advice of evolutionary biologist Thomas Huxley, Owens College accepted responsibility for the collections in 1867.
The college commissioned Alfred Waterhouse, architect of London's Natural History Museum, to design a museum on a site in Oxford Road to house the collections for the benefit of students and the public.
The Manchester Museum was opened to the public in 1888.
========,4,Whitworth Art Gallery.
The Whitworth Art Gallery houses collections of internationally famous British watercolours, textiles and wallpapers, modern and historic prints, drawings, paintings and sculpture.
It contains 31,000 items in its collection.
A programme of temporary exhibitions runs throughout the year and the Mezzanine Court displays sculpture.
The gallery was founded by Robert Darbishire with a donation from Sir Joseph Whitworth in 1889, as "The Whitworth Institute and Park".
In 1959 the gallery became part of the Victoria University of Manchester.
In October 1995 the Mezzanine Court in the centre of the building was opened.
It was designed to display sculptures and won a RIBA regional award.
========,3,Rankings and reputation.
According to "The Sunday Times", "Manchester has a formidable reputation spanning most disciplines, but most notably in the life sciences, engineering, humanities, economics, sociology and the social sciences".
As of 2016, Manchester is ranked as the 8th, 10th and 49th most reputable university in the UK, Europe and the world respectively.
Manchester was also given a prestigious award for Excellence and Innovation in the Arts by the "Times Higher Education Awards 2010".
In an employability ranking published by Emerging, where CEOs and chairmen were asked to select the top universities which they recruited from, Manchester placed 24th in the world and 5th nationally, ahead of academic powerhouses such as Cornell, UPenn and LSE.
The QS World University Rankings 2016-17 placed Manchester 29th in the world.
The Academic Ranking of World Universities 2016 ranked Manchester 5th in the UK and 35th in the world.
Manchester is ranked 56th in the world (and 8th in the UK) in the 2016 "Round University Ranking".
In 2011, the Manchester Business School was ranked 29th worldwide (4th nationally) by the Financial Times in its Global MBA ranking.
However, while world rankings (such as QS, ARWU, THE) typically place the university within the top 10 in the UK, in national studies the university ranks less favourably.
In "The Sunday Times" 10-year (1998–2007) average ranking of British universities based on consistent league table performance, Manchester was ranked 17th overall in the UK.
The Times/Sunday Times 'Good University Guide 2015' ranked Manchester 28th out of universities in the UK, 'The Complete University Guide 2016' placed it at 28th, whilst 'The Guardian University Guide 2016' ranked Manchester at 29th in the UK.
This apparent paradox is mainly a reflection of the different ranking methodologies employed by each listing: global rankings focus on research and international reputation, whereas national rankings are largely based on entry standards, graduate prospects and student satisfaction with teaching at the university.
========,3,Admissions.
Manchester had the 17th highest average entry qualification for undergraduates of any UK university in 2015, with new students averaging 431 UCAS points, equivalent to just above ABBab in A-level grades.
According to the 2017 "Times" and "Sunday Times" Good University Guide, approximately 18% of Manchester's undergraduates come from independent schools.
The university gives offers of admission to 73.4% of its applicants, the 10th lowest amongst the Russell Group.
========,3,Manchester University Press.
Manchester University Press is the university's academic publishing house.
It publishes academic monographs, textbooks and journals, most of which are works from authors based elsewhere in the international academic community, and is the third-largest university press in England after Oxford University Press and Cambridge University Press.
========,2,Student life.
========,3,Students' Union.
The University of Manchester Students' Union is the representative body of students at the university and the UK's largest students' union.
It was formed out of the merger between UMIST Students' Association and University of Manchester Union when the parent organisations UMIST and the Victoria University of Manchester merged on 1 October 2004.
Unlike many other students' unions in the UK, it does not have a president, but is run by an 8-member executive team who share joint responsibility.
========,3,Sport.
The University of Manchester operates sports clubs via the Athletics Union while student societies are operated by the Students' Union.
The university has more than 80 health and fitness classes while over 3,000 students are members of the 44 various Athletic Union clubs.
The sports societies vary widely in their level and scope.
Many more popular sports operate several university teams and departmental teams which compete in leagues against other teams within the university.
Teams include: lacrosse, korfball, dodgeball, hockey, rugby league, rugby union, football, basketball, netball and cricket.
The Manchester Aquatics Centre, the swimming pool used for the Manchester Commonwealth Games is on the campus.
The university competes annually in 28 different sports against Leeds and Liverpool universities in the Christie Cup, which Manchester has won for seven consecutive years.
The university has achieved success in the BUCS (British University & College Sports) competitions, with its men's water polo 1st team winning the national championships (2009, 2010, 2011) under the tutelage of coach Andy Howard.
It was positioned in eighth place in the overall BUCS rankings for 2009/10 The Christie Cup is an inter-university competition between Liverpool, Leeds and Manchester in numerous sports since 1886.
After the Oxford and Cambridge rivalry, the Christie's Championships is the oldest Inter–University competition on the sporting calendar: the cup was a benefaction of Richard Copley Christie.
Every year elite sportsmen and sportswomen are selected for membership of the "XXI Club", a society formed in 1932 to promote sporting excellence at the university.
Most members have gained a Full Maroon for representing the university and many have excelled at a British Universities or National level.
========,3,"University Challenge" quiz programme.
In the eight years up to 2013 Manchester have won the BBC2 quiz programme "University Challenge" four times, drawing equal with Magdalen College, Oxford, for the highest number of series wins.
Since merging as the University of Manchester, the university has consistently reached the latter stages of the competition, progressing to at least the semi-finals every year since 2005.
In 2006, Manchester beat Trinity Hall, Cambridge, to record the university's first win in the competition.
The next year, the university finished in second place after losing to the University of Warwick in the final.
In 2009, the team battled hard in the final against Corpus Christi College, Oxford.
At the gong, the score was 275 to 190 in favour of Corpus Christi College after a winning performance from Gail Trimble.
However, the title was eventually given to the University of Manchester after it was discovered that Corpus Christi team member Sam Kay had graduated eight months before the final was broadcast, so the team was disqualified.
Manchester reached the semi-finals in the 2010 competition before being beaten by Emmanuel College, Cambridge.
The university did not enter the 2011 series for an unknown reason.
However, Manchester did enter a year later and won University Challenge 2012.
Manchester has since defended its title to win University Challenge 2013, beating University College London, 190 to 140.
========,3,Student housing.
========,4,City Campus.
========,5,Whitworth Park Halls of Residence.
Whitworth Park Halls of Residence is owned by the University of Manchester and houses 1,085 students.
It is notable for its triangular shaped accommodation blocks which gave rise to the nickname of "Toblerones", after the chocolate bar.
Their designer took inspiration from a hill created from excavated soil which had been left in 1962 from an archaeological dig led by John Gater.
A consequence of the triangular design was a reduced cost for the construction company.
A deal struck between the university and Manchester City Council meant the council would pay for the roofs of all student residential buildings in the area, Allan Pluen's team is believed to have saved thousands on the final cost of the halls.
They were built in the mid-1970s.
The site of the halls was previously occupied by many small streets whose names have been preserved in the names of the halls.
Grove House is an older building that has been used by the university for many different purposes over the last sixty years.
Its first occupants in 1951 were the Appointments Board and the Manchester University Press.
The shops in Thorncliffe Place were part of the same plan and include banks and a convenience store.
Notable people associated with the halls include Friedrich Engels, whose residence is commemorated by a blue plaque on Aberdeen House; the physicist Brian Cox; and Irene Khan, Secretary General of Amnesty International.
========,5,Sackville Street.
The former UMIST Campus has five halls of residence near to Sackville Street building (Weston, Lambert, Fairfield, Chandos, and Wright Robinson), and several other halls within a 5–15-minute walk, such as the Grosvenor group of halls.
***LIST***.
Moberly Tower has been demolished.
Other residences include Vaughn House, once the home of the clergy serving the Church of the Holy Name, and George Kenyon Hall at University Place; Crawford House and Devonshire House adjacent to the Manchester Business School and Victoria Hall on Upper Brook Street.
========,4,Victoria Park Campus.
Victoria Park Campus comprises several halls of residence.
Among these are St. Anselm Hall with Canterbury Court and Pankhurst Court, Dalton-Ellis Hall, Hulme Hall (including Burkhardt House), St Gabriel's Hall and Opal Gardens Hall.
St. Anselm Hall is the only all-male hall in the United Kingdom.
========,4,Fallowfield Campus.
The Fallowfield Campus, south of the Oxford Road Campus is the largest of the university's residential campuses.
The Owens Park group of halls with a landmark tower is at its centre, while Oak House is another hall of residence.
Woolton Hall is next to Oak House.
Allen Hall is a traditional hall near Ashburne Hall (Sheavyn House being annexed to Ashburne).
Richmond Park is a recent addition to the campus.
========,2,Notable people.
Many notable people have worked or studied at one or both of the two former institutions that now form the University of Manchester, including 25 Nobel prize laureates.
Some of the best-known are: John Dalton (founder of modern atomic theory), Ernest Rutherford who proved the nuclear nature of the atom whilst working at Manchester, Ludwig Wittgenstein (considered one of the most significant philosophers of the 20th century, who studied for a doctorate in engineering), George E. Davis (founder of the discipline of Chemical Engineering), Marie Stopes (pioneer of birth control and campaigner for women's rights), Bernard Lovell (a pioneer of radio astronomy), Alan Turing (one of the founders of computer science and artificial intelligence), Tom Kilburn and Frederic Calland Williams (who developed Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM) or "Baby", the world's first stored-program computer at Victoria University of Manchester in 1948), Irene Khan (former Secretary General of Amnesty International), physicist and television presenter Brian Cox, the author Anthony Burgess and Robert Bolt (two times Academy Award winner and three times Golden Globe winner for writing the screenplay for "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Doctor Zhivago").
