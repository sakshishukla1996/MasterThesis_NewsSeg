========,2,History.
The area now occupied by Murray County was part of the land granted to the Choctaw Nation by the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek in 1820.
The Chickasaw received part of the land under the Treaty of Doaksville in 1838.
The area became part of the Chickasaw Nation in 1855.
There was an extended conflict before the U.S. Civil War between the Plains Indians and the newly arrived Choctaws and Chickasaws.
The U.S. Army built Fort Towson (1824); Fort Washita (1842) and Fort Arbuckle (1851) to protect the Chickasaws.
After the conflict between the tribes was settled, various bands of outlaws moved in and continued to create law enforcement problems.
Sulphur began developing in the 1880s around the springs for which it was named.
The springs encouraged the building of bathhouses and spas.
Several were established by the time that a post office was established in 1898.
The Sulphur Springs Railway (acquired by the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway in 1907) arrived there in 1902, and the 1904 establishment of Platt National Park, with headquarters at Sulphur, spurred the expansion of services for health-seekers.
Other visitors were drawn to the park and to nearby Turner Falls, making Sulphur one of the state's earliest recreational centers.
Murray County was created when the Choctaw Nation was disestablished immediately before Oklahoma statehood.
Sulphur was declared as the county seat.

========,2,Economy.
Farming and ranching were the basis of the economy during the time when the area was part of the Chickasaw Nation.
The area was called "the Prairie of Eden" because its plentiful grasslands attracted abundant game, Chickasaw ranchers Noah Lael and Perry Froman operated and headquartered near Sulphur by 1881.
Settlements of farmers and businesses expanded through the decade, spurred by the construction of rail lines by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway lines through to Dougherty and Davis in 1886-87.
Post offices were established at Dougherty in 1887 and Davis in 1890.
Cattle ranching, the other primary industry, continued into the twenty-first century, and Murray County has long been recognized as the center of "Hereford Heaven."
Notable ranching operations included those of Oklahoma Gov.
Roy J. Turner.
On New Year's Eve, 1947, the Flying L Ranch near Davis was the site for the marriage of Roy Rogers, "King of the Cowboys," and Dale Evans.
The location of the Oklahoma School for the Deaf at Sulphur in 1907, and a veterans center added to the region's economy.
Limestone quarries were also significant.
The most important example of this activity began in the 1890s at Big Canyon, home to operations of the Dolese Brothers, whose company became a major state employer.
