His father, James Curry, a chaplain in the Royal Navy, died when Curry was 12.
Curry's mother, Patricia, a school secretary, died in June 1999 after living with cancer for two years.
His older sister, Judith ("Judy"), was a concert pianist who died of a brain tumour in the early 2000s.
Curry spent most of his childhood in Plymouth, Devon, but, after his father's death from pneumonia in 1958, his family moved to South London.
Curry then went to boarding school and attended Kingswood School in Bath, Somerset.
He developed into a talented boy soprano (treble).
Deciding to concentrate on acting, Curry graduated from the University of Birmingham with a combined degree in English and Drama (BA Drama & Theatre Studies, 1968).
========,2,Acting career.
========,3,"Rocky Horror".
Curry's first full-time role was as part of the original London cast of the musical "Hair" in 1968, where he first met Richard O'Brien who went on to write Curry's next full-time role, that of Dr. Frank-N-Furter in "The Rocky Horror Show" (1975).
Curry recalled his first encounter with the project:
Originally, Curry rehearsed the character with a German accent and peroxide blond hair, and later, with an American accent.
In March 2005, in an interview with Terry Gross of NPR's "Fresh Air", he explains that he decided to play Dr. Frank-N-Furter with an English accent after listening to an English woman say, "Do you have a house in town or a house in the country," and decided, "Yes, (Dr. Frank-N-Furter) should sound like the Queen."
Curry originally thought the character was merely a laboratory doctor dressed in a white lab coat.
However, at the suggestion of director Sharman, the character evolved into the diabolical mad scientist and transvestite with an upper-class Belgravia accent that carried over to the cult classic "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" and made Curry both a household name and gave him a cult following.
He continued to play the character in London, Los Angeles, and New York City until 1975.
In an interview with NPR, Curry called "Rocky Horror" a "rite of passage," and added that the film is "...a guaranteed weekend party to which you can go with or without a date and probably find one if you don't have one and it's also a chance for people to try on a few roles for size, you know?
Figure out, help them maybe figure out their own sexuality."
In 2016, Curry played The Criminologist in the of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show".

It won two Tony Awards (Best Performance by an Actor for John Wood and Best Comedy), as well as the New York Drama Critics Circle Award (Best Play), and Curry's performance as the famous dadaist Tristan Tzara received good reviews.
In 1981, Curry formed part of the original cast in the Broadway show "Amadeus", playing the title character, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
