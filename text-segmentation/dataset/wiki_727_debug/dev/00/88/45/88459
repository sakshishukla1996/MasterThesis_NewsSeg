========,1,preface.
The Spanish Revolution was a workers' social revolution that began during the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organizational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years, primarily Catalonia, Aragon, Andalusia, and parts of the Valencian Community.
Much of the economy of Spain was put under worker control; in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia, the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy influence by the Communist Party of Spain.
Factories were run through worker committees, agrarian areas became collectivized and run as libertarian socialist communes.
Even places like hotels, barber shops, and restaurants were collectivized and managed by their workers.
Sam Dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution, which he claimed "came closer to realizing the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history."
Dolgoff quotes the French anarchist historian Gaston Leval (who was an active participant) to summarize the anarchist conception of the social revolution:
The collectivization effort was primarily orchestrated by the rank-and-file members of the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT; English: National Confederation of Labor) and the Federación Anarquista Ibérica (FAI; English: Iberian Anarchist Federation), with the two often abbreviated as CNT–FAI due to the affinity between the two organizations and the major role of the latter within the former in maintaining anarchist "purity."
The non-anarchist socialist Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT; English: General Union of Workers) also participated in the implementation of collectivization, albeit to a far lesser degree.
========,2,Orwell's account.
The British author George Orwell, best known for his anti-authoritarian works "Animal Farm" and "Nineteen Eighty-Four", was a soldier in the militia of the CNT-allied Partido Obrero Unificación Marxista (POUM; English: Workers' Party of Marxist Unification).
Orwell meticulously documented his first-hand observations of the civil war, and expressed admiration for the social revolution in his book "Homage to Catalonia".
Continuing, Orwell describes the general feeling of the new society that was built within the shell of the old, offering specific elaborations on the effective destruction of hierarchical arrangements that he'd perceived in anarchist Spain.
Orwell was a democratic socialist and a left-libertarian sympathizer who expressed solidarity with the anarchist movement and social revolution, later commenting, "I had told everyone for a long time past that I was going to leave the P.O.U.M.
As far as my purely personal preferences went I would have liked to join the Anarchists."
========,2,Social revolution.
The most notable aspect of the social revolution was the establishment of a libertarian socialist economy based on coordination through decentralized and horizontal federations of participatory industrial collectives and agrarian communes.
Here are just a few opinions of foreign journalists who have no personal connection with the Anarchist movement.
Thus, Andrea Oltmares, professor in the University of Geneva, in the course of an address of some length, said: 
The well-known anti-Fascist, Carlo Rosselli, who before Mussolini's accession to power was Professor of Economics in the University of Genoa, put his judgment into the following words: 
And Fenner Brockway, Secretary of the I.L.P.
in England who traveled to Spain after the May events in Catalonia (1937), expressed his impressions in the following words:  "I was impressed by the strength of the C.N.T.
It was unnecessary to tell me that it was the largest and most vital of the working-class organisations in Spain.
The large industries were clearly, in the main, in the hands of the C.N.T.--railways, road transport, shipping, engineering, textiles, electricity, building, agriculture.
At Valencia the U.G.T.
had a larger share of control than at Barcelona, but generally speaking the mass of manual workers belonged to the C.N.T.
The U.G.T.
membership was more of the type of the 'white-collar' worker...I was immensely impressed by the constructive revolutionary work which is being done by the C.N.T.
Their achievement of workers' control in industry is an inspiration.
One could take the example of the railways or engineering or textiles...There are still some Britishers and Americans who regard the Anarchists of Spain as impossible, undisciplined, uncontrollable.
This is poles away from the truth.
The Anarchists of Spain, through the C.N.T., are doing one of the biggest constructive jobs ever done by the working class.
At the front they are fighting Fascism.
Behind the front they are actually constructing the new Workers' Society.
They see that the war against Fascism and the carrying through of the Social Revolution are inseparable.
Those who have seen and understand what they are doing must honour them and be grateful to them.
They are resisting Fascism.
They are at the same time creating the New Workers' Order which is the only alternative to Fascism.
That is surely the biggest things now being done by the workers in any part of the world."
And in another place: "The great solidarity that existed amongst the Anarchists was due to each individual relying on his own strength and not depending on leadership.
The organisations must, to be successful, be combined with a free-thinking people; not a mass, but free individuals."
- all three cited in: Rudolf Rocker, "Anarcho-Syndicalism, Original 1938, AK Press Edition, page 66-67.
This was accomplished through widespread expropriation and collectivization of privately owned productive resources (and some smaller structures), in adherence to the anarchist belief that private property is authoritarian in nature.
Spanish Civil War scholar (and anti-socialist) Burnett Bolloten writes of this process:  The economic policies of the anarchist collectives were primarily operated according to the basic communist principle of "From each according to his ability, to each according to his need".
In some places, money was entirely eliminated, to be replaced with vouchers and coupons distributed on the basis of needs rather than individual labor contributions.
Bolloten writes of this process also:
Bolloten supplements this analysis through quotation of anarchist journalist Augustin Souchy's remark that "The characteristic of the majority of CNT collectives is the family wage.
Wages are paid according to the needs of the members and not according to the labor performed by each worker."
This focus on provision for the needs of members rather than individual remuneration effectively rendered these conditions anarcho-communist in nature.
Despite the critics clamoring for "maximum efficiency" rather than revolutionary methods, anarchist collectives often produced more than before the collectivization.
In Aragon, for instance, the productivity increased by 20%.
The newly liberated zones worked on entirely libertarian principles; decisions were made through councils of ordinary citizens without any sort of bureaucracy (it should be noted that the CNT–FAI leadership was at this time not nearly as radical as the rank and file members responsible for these sweeping changes).
In addition to the economic revolution, there was a spirit of cultural revolution.
Traditions some viewed as oppressive were done away with.
For instance, women were legally permitted to have abortions, and the idea of "free love" became widely prevalent.
In many ways, this spirit of cultural liberation prefigured that of the "New Left" movements of the 1960s.
As the war dragged on, the spirit of the revolution's early days flagged.
In part, this was due to the policies of the Communist Party of Spain, which took its cues from the foreign ministry of Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union, the source of most of the foreign aid received by the Republican side.
The Communist policy was that the war was not the time for the revolution, that until victory in the war was won the goal had to be the defeat of the Francisco Franco forces, not the abolition of capitalism, which was to be addressed once the war had been won.
The other left-wing parties, particularly the anarchists and POUM, disagreed vehemently with this; to them the war and the revolution were one and the same.
Militias of parties and groups which had spoken out too vociferously in opposition to the Soviet position on the war soon found further aid to have been cut off.
Partially because of this, the situation in most Republican-held areas slowly began to revert largely to its prewar conditions; in many ways the "revolution" was over well before the triumph of the Franco forces in early 1939.
========,2,Criticisms.
Criticism of the Spanish Revolution has primarily centered around allegations of coercion by anarchist participants (primarily in the rural collectives of Aragon), which critics charge run contrary to libertarian organizational principles.
Bolloten claims that CNT–FAI reports overplayed the voluntary nature of collectivization, and ignored the more widespread realities of coercion or outright force as the primary characteristic of anarchist organization.
He also emphasizes the generally coercive nature of the war climate and anarchist military organization and presence in many portions of the countryside as being an element in the establishment of collectivization, even if outright force or blatant coercion was not used to bind participants against their will.
This charge had previously been made by historian Ronald Fraser in his "Blood of Spain: An Oral History of the Spanish Civil War", who commented that direct force was not necessary in the context of an otherwise coercive war climate.
Anarchist sympathizers counter that the presence of a "coercive climate" was an unavoidable aspect of the war that the anarchists cannot be fairly blamed for, and that the presence of deliberate coercion or direct force was minimal, as evidenced by a generally peaceful mixture of collectivists and individualist dissenters who had opted not to participate in collective organization.
The latter sentiment is expressed by historian Antony Beevor in his "Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939".
Historian Graham Kelsey also maintains that the anarchist collectives were primarily maintained through libertarian principles of voluntary association and organization, and that the decision to join and participate was generally based on a rational and balanced choice made after the destabilization and effective absence of capitalism as a powerful factor in the region.
There is also focus placed by pro-anarchist analysts on the many decades of organization and shorter period of CNT–FAI agitation that was to serve as a foundation for high membership levels throughout anarchist Spain, which is often referred to as a basis for the popularity of the anarchist collectives, rather than any presence of force or coercion that allegedly compelled unwilling persons to involuntarily participate.
Michael Seidman has suggested there were other contradictions with workers' self-management during the Spanish Revolution.
He points out that the CNT decided both that workers could be sacked for 'laziness or immorality' and also that all workers should 'have a file where the details of their professional and social personalities will be registered.'
He also notes that the CNT Justice Minister, García Oliver, initiated the setting up of 'labour camps' and that even the most principled anarchists, the Friends of Durruti, advocated 'forced labour'.
Whether or not these assertions are true, however, it should be noted that there were never any such systems of forced labor in the anarchist territories, and due to the strain of wartime production it's highly unlikely that any workers were fired for "immorality".
Anarchist authors have sometimes understated the problems that the working class sometimes faced during the Spanish Revolution during the early period of the movement.
For example, while Gaston Leval does admit that the collectives imposed a 'work discipline' that was 'strict', he then restricts this comment to a mere footnote.
Other radical commentators, however, have incorporated the limitations of the Spanish Revolution into their theories of anti-capitalist revolution.
Gilles Dauvé, for example, uses the Spanish experience to argue that to transcend capitalism, workers must completely abolish both wage labour and capital rather than just self-manage them.
