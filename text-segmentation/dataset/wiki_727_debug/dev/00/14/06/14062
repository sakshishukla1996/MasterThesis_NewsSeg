The Hook of Holland () is a town in the southwestern corner of Holland (hence the name; "hoek" means "corner"), at the mouth of the New Waterway shipping canal into the North Sea.
The town is administered by the municipality of Rotterdam as a district of that city.
Its district covers an area of 16.7 km, of which 13.92 km is land.
On 1 January 1999 it had an estimated population of 9,400.
Towns near "the Hook" () include Monster, 's-Gravenzande, Naaldwijk and Delft to the northeast, and Maassluis to the southeast.
On the other side of the river is the Europort and the Maasvlakte.
The wide sandy beach, one section of which is designated for use by naturists, runs for approximately 18 kilometres to Scheveningen and for most of this distance is backed by extensive sand dunes through which there are foot and cycle paths.
On the north side of the New Waterway, to the west of the town, is a pier part of which is accessible to pedestrians and cyclists.
The Berghaven is a small harbour on the New Waterway where the Rotterdam and Europort pilots are based.
This small harbour is only for the use of the pilot service, government vessels and the Hook of Holland lifeboat.
During World War II this was one of the most important places for the Germans to hold because of the harbour.
