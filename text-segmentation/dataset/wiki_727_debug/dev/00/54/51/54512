========,1,preface.
"The Maple Leaf Forever" is a Canadian song written by Alexander Muir (1830–1906) in 1867, the year of Canada's Confederation.
He wrote the work after serving with the Queen's Own Rifles of Toronto in the Battle of Ridgeway against the Fenians in 1866.
========,2,History.
Muir was said to have been inspired to write this song by a large maple tree which stood on his street in front of Maple Cottage, a house at Memory Lane and Laing Street in Toronto.
The song became quite popular in English Canada and for many years served as an unofficial national anthem.
Because of its strongly British perspective it became unpopular amongst French Canadians, and this prevented it from ever becoming an official anthem, even though it was seriously considered for that role and was even used as a "de facto" anthem in many instances.
The tree which inspired Muir's song was felled during a windstorm on the night of July 19–20, 2013.
Residents have expressed their hope that the city will be able to start a new tree from one of the branches.
During the early 1870s, Alexander Muir was an elementary school teacher in Newmarket, north of Toronto.
When the cornerstone of the Christian Church in Newmarket was being laid on June 25, 1874 by the Governor General, Lord Dufferin, Muir brought his school choir to the event to sing his new composition, "The Maple Leaf Forever", its first public performance.
It has been asserted that Muir's words, however, while certainly pro-British, were not anti-French, and he revised the lyrics of the first verse from "Here may it wave, our boast, our pride, and join in love together / The Thistle, Shamrock, Rose entwine" to "/ The Lily, Thistle, Shamrock, Rose, the Maple Leaf forever" the thistle represented Scotland; the shamrock, Ireland; and the rose, England adding "Lily", a French symbol, to the list.
According to other accounts, this was actually the original wording.
Muir was attempting to express that under the Union Flag, the British and French were united as Canadians.
"The Maple Leaf Forever" is also the authorized regimental march of The Royal Westminster Regiment.
Additionally, it is the Regimental Slow March of the Fort Henry Guard.
The song makes reference to James Wolfe capturing Quebec in 1759 during the Seven Years' War and the Battle of Queenston Heights and Battle of Lundy's Lane during the War of 1812.
========,3,Alternative lyrics.
CBC Radio's "Metro Morning" show in Toronto ran a contest to find new lyrics for the song in 1997.
The contest was won by Romanian immigrant, mathematician, and now a songwriter, actor and poet, Vladimir Radian, who came to Canada in the 1980s.
This version received its first full orchestral treatment on June 27, 1997, at a concert by the Toronto Symphony Orchestra.
The new version removed all references to British-Canadian heritage and the Union Flag, but added a special reference to Quebec's provincial symbol, the fleur-de-lis.
O, land of blue unending skies, Mountains strong and sparkling snow, A scent of freedom in the wind, O'er the emerald fields below.
To thee we brought our hopes, our dreams, For thee we stand together, Our land of peace, where proudly flies,  The Maple Leaf forever.
"Chorus:" Long may it wave, and grace our own, Blue skies and stormy weather, Within my heart, above my home, The Maple Leaf forever!
From East and West, our heroes came, Through icy fields and frozen bays, Who conquered fear, and cold, and hate, And their ancient wisdom says:
Protect the weak, defend your rights, And build this land together, Above which shine the Northern Lights, And the Maple Leaf forever!
"(Chorus)" Sur mers sauvages ou glaciers durs, Tant d'héros se sont suivis, En conquérant la peur, le froid, Et les tempêtes de leurs vies.
Et tant de braves, rouges ou blancs, Reposent ici ensemble,  De noble sang, de tant de neige, Est née la feuille d'érable.
"Refrain" De leurs exploits, de leurs travaux, Et leur courage sublime, Dans leurs vieux rêves réunis, Puisons nouvelles racines.
"Refrain Reprise" Sur nos montagnes, dans nos prairies, À travers temps et sable, Aimons toujours la fleur de lys, Toujours, la feuille d'érable.
Oh, Maple Leaf, around the world, You speak as you rise high above, Of courage, peace and quiet strength, Of the Canada I love.
Remind us all our union bound,  By ties we cannot sever, Bright flag revered on every ground, The Maple Leaf forever!
"(Chorus)" Padre G. E. Benton, a former Canadian army chaplain, also wrote a revised version* with the lyrics as follows:
In days of yore from splendid shores,
Bold and true, our founders came,
And planted firm those rights of old,
Into Canada's fair domain,
This hallowed oath and legacy,
We vow to yield it never!,
For life and peace and liberty!,
The Maple Leaf Forever!,
The Maple Leaf, our emblem dear,
The Maple Leaf Forever!,
Long may it wave and God defend,
The Maple Leaf Forever!,
Thro' battle flame in lands afar,
Our brave warriors side by side,
For freedom, home, and lov'd ones dear,
Firmly stood and nobly died,
Their sacrifice and valour shine,
Their Names Will Live Forever!,
O Valiant hearts whose deeds proclaim,
The Maple Leaf Forever!,
The Maple Leaf, our emblem dear,
The Maple Leaf Forever!,
Long may it wave and God defend,
The Maple Leaf Forever!,
O land where season's gifts abound,
Earth's own bounties rich embrace,
Where flowing waters' majesty,
Sing the hymn of freedom's grace,
From oceantide to northern light,
All bound as One Together!,
Dominion blessed from sea to sea,
The Maple Leaf Forever!,
The Maple Leaf, our emblem dear,
The Maple Leaf Forever!,
Long may it wave and God defend,
The Maple Leaf Forever!,
The Canadian vocal harmony trio "Finest Kind" (Ian Robb, Ann Downey and Shelley Posen) recorded "The Maple Leaf Forever" on their 2003 CD "Silks & Spices".
This version, with new words co-written by Posen and Robb and harmony arrangement by the trio, was sung at the ceremonial planting in Ottawa of two silver maple seedlings: direct descendants of the tree which is thought to have inspired Alexander Muir to write the original song in 1867.
The ceremony occurred on November 2, 2014, and was attended by several local dignitaries and military veterans.
The words acknowledge the Aboriginal, French, English and "new Canadian" contributions to the evolution of Canada, and highlight Canada's more recent military role as peacekeepers "where hate and war divide".
The second verse also references John McCrae's iconic First World War poem "In Flanders Fields".
"The Maple Leaf Forever" Music: Alexander Muir 1867.
New words written in 2003 by Sheldon Posen and Ian Robb
In days of yore, to this wild shore
French and British strangers came
And planted firm their conquerors' flags
Where Native peoples reigned
In struggle and in hope they forged
A nation here together
That there might wave so proud and free
The Maple Leaf forever.
Through bitter wars in freedom's cause
Brave Canadians fought and died
Now we, their children, guard the peace
Where hate and war divide
We'll not break faith with glories past
The torch we'll lower never
A shining light to all the world
The Maple Leaf forever.
From Arctic land to Great Lakes strand Baie d’Espoir to Nootka Sound May patriot love unite us and True commonwealth be found; And may Canadians new and old Uphold the great endeavour And proudly wave from sea to sea The Maple Leaf forever.
The Maple Leaf, our emblem dear The Maple Leaf forever And proudly wave from sea to sea The Maple Leaf forever.
========,3,Maple Leaf Gardens/Winter Olympics.
During the final game of the Toronto Maple Leafs at their former home stadium, Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, Anne Murray sang another version (modified from Radian's version) of the "Maple Leaf Forever" to the crowd.
This version was also used by Michael Bublé during the 2010 Winter Olympics closing ceremony:
O, land of blue unending skies, Mountains strong and sparkling snow, A scent of freedom in the wind, O'er the emerald fields below.
To thee we brought our hopes, our dreams, For thee we stand together, Our land of peace, where proudly flies,  The Maple Leaf forever.
"Chorus:" Long may it wave, and grace our own, Blue skies and stormy weather, Within my heart, above my home, The Maple Leaf forever!
"Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen, last minute of play!"
(This announcement wasn't made at the Olympic closing ceremony) O, Maple Leaf around the world, You speak as you rise high above, Of courage, peace and quiet strength, Of the Canada that I love.
Remind us all, our union bound By ties we cannot sever, Bright flag revered on every ground, The Maple Leaf forever!
