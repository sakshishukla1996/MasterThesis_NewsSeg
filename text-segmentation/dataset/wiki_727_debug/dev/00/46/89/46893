========,2,History.
========,3,Brazilian "Sansei".
Brazil is home to the largest Japanese population outside Japan, numbering an estimate of more than 1.5 million (including those of mixed-race or mixed-ethnicity), more than that of the 1.2 million in the United States.
The "Sansei" Japanese Brazilians are an important part of that ethnic minority in that South American nation.
========,3,American "Sansei".
The majority of American "Sansei" were born during the Baby Boom after the end of World War II; but older "Sansei" who were living in the western United States during WWII were forcibly interned with their parents ("Nisei") and grandparents ("Issei") after Executive Order 9066 was promulgated to exclude everyone of Japanese descent from large parts of the Western states.
The " Sansei" were forceful activists in the redress movement, which resulted in an official apology to the internees.
In some senses, the "Sansei" seem to feel they are caught in a dilemma between their "quiet" Nisei parents and their other identity model of "verbal" Americans.
In the United States, a representative "Sansei" is General Eric Shinseki (born November 28, 1942), the 34th Chief of Staff of the United States Army (1999–2003) and former United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs.
He is the first Asian American in U.S. history to be a four-star general, and the first to lead one of the four U.S. military services.
========,2,Cultural profile.
========,3,Generations.
Japanese-Americans and Japanese-Canadians have special names for each of their generations in North America.
These are formed by combining one of the Japanese numbers corresponding to the generation with the Japanese word for generation ("sei" 世).
The Japanese-American and Japanese-Canadian communities have themselves distinguished their members with terms like "Issei", "Nisei," and "Sansei" which describe the first, second and third generation of immigrants.
The fourth generation is called "Yonsei" (四世) and the fifth is called "Gosei" (五世).
The "Issei," "Nisei" and "Sansei" generations reflect distinctly different attitudes to authority, gender, non- Japanese involvement, religious belief and practice, and other matters.
The age when individuals faced the wartime evacuation and internment is the single, most significant factor which explains these variations in their experiences, attitudes and behaviour patterns.
The term "Nikkei" (日系) was coined by a multinational group of sociologists and encompasses all of the world's Japanese immigrants across generations.
The collective memory of the "Issei" and older "Nisei" was an image of Meiji Japan from 1870 through 1911, which contrasted sharply with the Japan that newer immigrants had more recently left.
These differing attitudes, social values and associations with Japan were often incompatible with each other.
In this context, the significant differences in post-war experiences and opportunities did nothing to mitigate the gaps which separated generational perspectives.
In North America since the redress victory in 1988, a significant evolutionary change has occurred.
The "Sansei," their parents, their grandparents, and their children are changing the way they look at themselves and their pattern of accommodation to the non-Japanese majority.
There are currently just over one hundred thousand British Japanese, mostly in London; but unlike other "Nikkei" communities elsewhere in the world, these Britons do not conventionally parse their communities in generational terms as "Issei," "Nisei," or "Sansei."
========,4,Sansei.
The third generation of immigrants, born in the United States or Canada to parents born in the United States or Canada, is called "Sansei" (三世).
Children born to the "Nisei" were generally born after 1945.
They speak English as their first language and are completely acculturized in the contexts of Canadian or American society.
They tend to identify with Canadian or American values, norms and expectations.
Few speak Japanese, and most tend to express their identity as Canadian or American rather than Japanese.
Among the "Sansei" there is an overwhelming percentage of marriages to persons of non-Japanese ancestry.
========,4,Aging.
The "kanreki" (還暦), a traditional, pre-modern Japanese rite of passage to old age at 60, was sometimes celebrated by the "Issei" and is now being celebrated by increasing numbers of "Nisei" and a few "Sansei."
Rituals are enactments of shared meanings, norms, and values; and this Japanese rite of passage highlights a collective response among the Nisei to the conventional dilemmas of growing older.
========,2,Notable individuals.
The numbers of "sansei" who have earned some degree of public recognition has continued to increase over time; but the quiet lives of those whose names are known only to family and friends are no less important in understanding the broader narrative of the "Nikkei."
Although the names highlighted here are over-represented by "sansei" from North America, the Latin American member countries of the Pan American Nikkei Association (PANA) include Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, in addition to the English-speaking United States and Canada.
