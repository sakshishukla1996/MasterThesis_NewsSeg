========,1,preface.
In mathematics, the Euler numbers are a sequence "E" of integers defined by the Taylor series expansion where is the hyperbolic cosine.
The Euler numbers appear as a special value of the Euler polynomials.
The odd-indexed Euler numbers are all zero.
The even-indexed ones have alternating signs.
Some values are:
Some authors re-index the sequence in order to omit the odd-numbered Euler numbers with value zero, or change all signs to positive.
This article adheres to the convention adopted above.
The Euler numbers appear in the Taylor series expansions of the secant and hyperbolic secant functions.
The latter is the function in the definition.
They also occur in combinatorics, specifically when counting the number of alternating permutations of a set with an even number of elements.

An explicit formula for Euler numbers is:
where denotes the imaginary unit with .
========,3,As a sum over partitions.
The Euler number can be expressed as a sum over the even partitions of , as well as a sum over the odd partitions of , where in both cases and is a multinomial coefficient.
The Kronecker deltas in the above formulas restrict the sums over the s to and to , respectively.
As an example,
