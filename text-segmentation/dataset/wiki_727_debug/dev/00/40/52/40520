The United States presidential election of 1864 was the 20th quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 8, 1864.
In this match, incumbent president Republican Abraham Lincoln ran for reelection against Democratic candidate George B. McClellan, who tried to portray himself to the voters as the "peace candidate" who wanted to bring the American Civil War to a speedy end.
Lincoln was re-elected president by a landslide in the Electoral College.
Since the election of 1860, the Electoral College had expanded with the admission of Kansas, West Virginia, and Nevada as free-soil states.
As the Civil War was still raging, no electoral votes were counted from any of the eleven southern states that had joined the Confederate States of America.
Lincoln won by more than 400,000 popular votes, partly as a result of the recent Union victory at the Battle of Atlanta and was the first president to be re-elected since Democrat Andrew Jackson in 1832.
The second inauguration of Abraham Lincoln took place on March 4, 1865, but he was assassinated on April 15, 1865, only 42 days later.
Lincoln's second term is the second shortest term served by any U.S. president, next to the 31-day presidency of William Henry Harrison.
========,2,Background.
The Presidential election of 1864 took place during the American Civil War.
According to the Miller Center for the study of the presidency, the election was noteworthy for occurring at all, an unprecedented democratic exercise in the midst of a civil war.
A group of Republican dissidents who called themselves Radical Republicans formed a party named the Radical Democracy Party and nominated John C. Frémont as their candidate for president.
Frémont later withdrew and endorsed Lincoln.
In the Border States, War Democrats joined with Republicans as the National Union Party, with Lincoln at the head of the ticket.
The National Union Party was a temporary name used to attract War Democrats and Border State Unionists who would not vote for the Republican Party.
It faced off against the regular Democratic Party, including Peace Democrats.

========,4,Temporary split in the Republican Party.
As the Civil War progressed, political opinions within the Republican Party began to diverge.
Senators Charles Sumner and Henry Wilson from Massachusetts wanted the Republican Party to advocate constitutional amendments to prohibit slavery and guarantee racial equality before the law.
Initially, not all northern Republicans supported such measures.
Democratic leaders hoped that the radical Republicans would put forth their own ticket in the election.
The "New York World", particularly interested in undermining the National Union Party, ran a series of articles predicting a delay for the National Union Convention until late in 1864 to allow Frémont time to collect delegates to win the nomination.
Frémont supporters in New York City established a newspaper called the "New Nation", which declared in one of its initial issues that the National Union Convention would be a "nonentity".
========,4,National Union Party.
Before the election, some War Democrats joined the Republicans to form the National Union Party.
With the outcome of the Civil War still in doubt, some political leaders, including Salmon P. Chase, Benjamin Wade, and Horace Greeley, opposed Lincoln's re-nomination on the grounds that he could not win.
Chase himself became the only candidate to contest Lincoln's re-nomination actively, but he withdrew in March when a slew of Republican officials, including some within the state of Ohio upon whom Chase's campaign depended, endorsed Lincoln for re-nomination.
Lincoln was still popular with most members of the Republican Party, and the National Union Party nominated him for a second term as president at their convention in Baltimore, Maryland, on June 7–8, 1864.
The party platform included these goals:
Andrew Johnson, the former senator from and current military governor of Tennessee, was named as Lincoln's vice presidential running-mate.
Others who were considered for the nomination, at one point or another, were former Senator Daniel Dickinson, Major General Benjamin Butler, Major General William Rosecrans, Joseph Holt, and former Treasury Secretary and Senator John Dix.

The Democratic Party was bitterly split between War Democrats and Peace Democrats, a group further divided among competing factions.
Moderate Peace Democrats who supported the war against the Confederacy, such as Horatio Seymour, were preaching the wisdom of a negotiated peace.
After the Union victory at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863, moderate Peace Democrats proposed a negotiated peace that would secure Union victory.
They believed this was the best course of action, because an armistice could finish the war without devastating the South.
Radical Peace Democrats known as Copperheads, such as Thomas H. Seymour, declared the war to be a failure and favored an immediate end to hostilities without securing Union victory.
George B. McClellan vied for the presidential nomination.
Additionally, friends of Horatio Seymour insisted on placing his name before the convention, which was held in Chicago, Illinois, on August 29–31, 1864.
But on the day before the organization of that body, Horatio Seymour announced positively that he would not be a candidate.
Since the Democrats were divided by issues of war and peace, they sought a strong candidate who could unify the party.
The compromise was to nominate pro-war General George B. McClellan for president and anti-war Representative George H. Pendleton for vice-president.
McClellan, a War Democrat, was nominated over the Copperhead Thomas H. Seymour.
Pendleton, a close associate of the Copperhead Clement Vallandigham, balanced the ticket, since he was known for having strongly opposed the Union war effort.
The convention then adopted a peace platform — a platform McClellan personally rejected.
McClellan supported the continuation of the war and restoration of the Union, but the party platform, written by Vallandigham, opposed this position.

The Radical Democracy Convention assembled in Ohio with delegates arriving on May 29, 1864.
"The New York Times" reported that the hall which the convention organizers had planned to use had been double-booked by an opera troupe.
Almost all delegates were instructed to support Frémont, with a major exception being the New York delegation, which was composed of War Democrats who supported Ulysses S. Grant.
Various estimates of the number of delegates were reported in the press; the "New York Times" reported 156 delegates, but the number generally reported elsewhere was 350 delegates.
The delegates came from 15 states and the District of Columbia.
They adopted the name "Radical Democracy Party."
A supporter of Grant was appointed chairman.
The platform was passed with little discussion, and a series of resolutions that bogged down the convention proceedings were voted down decisively.
The convention nominated Frémont for president, and he accepted the nomination on June 4, 1864.
In his letter, he stated that he would step aside if the National Union Convention would nominate someone other than Lincoln.
John Cochrane was nominated for vice-president.
========,2,General election.
The 1864 election was the first time since 1812 that a presidential election took place during a war.
For much of 1864, Lincoln himself believed he had little chance of being re-elected.
Confederate forces had triumphed at the Battle of Mansfield, the Battle of the Crater, and the Battle of Cold Harbor.
In addition, the war was continuing to take a very high toll in terms of casualties.
The prospect of a long and bloody war started to make the idea of "peace at all cost" offered by the Copperheads look more desirable.
Because of this, McClellan was thought to be a heavy favorite to win the election.
Unfortunately for Lincoln, Frémont's campaign got off to a good start.
However, several political and military events eventually made Lincoln's re-election inevitable.
In the first place, the Democrats had to confront the severe internal strains within their party at the Democratic National Convention.
The political compromises made at the Democratic National Convention were contradictory and made McClellan's efforts to campaign seem inconsistent.
Secondly, the Democratic National Convention influenced Frémont's campaign.
Frémont was appalled at the Democratic platform, which he described as "union with slavery."
After three weeks of discussions with Cochrane and his supporters, Frémont withdrew from the race in September 1864.
In his statement, Frémont declared that winning the Civil War was too important to divide the Republican vote.
Although he still felt that Lincoln was not going far enough, the defeat of McClellan was of the greatest necessity.
General Cochrane, who was a War Democrat, agreed and withdrew with Frémont.
Frémont also brokered a political deal in which Lincoln removed U.S. Postmaster General Montgomery Blair from office.
McClellan's chances of victory faded after Frémont withdrew from the presidential race.
Lastly, with the fall of Atlanta on September 2, there was no longer any question that a Union military victory was inevitable and close at hand.
In the end, the Union Party mobilized the full strength of both the Republicans and the War Democrats under the its slogan "Don't change horses in the middle of a stream."
It was energized as Lincoln made emancipation the central issue, and state Republican parties stressed the perfidy of the Copperheads.
========,3,Results.
Because eleven Southern states had declared secession from the Union and formed the Confederate States of America, only twenty-five states participated in the election.
Three new states participated for the first time: Kansas, West Virginia, and Nevada.
The reconstructed portions of Louisiana and Tennessee chose presidential electors, although Congress did not count their votes.
McClellan won just three states: Kentucky, Delaware, and his home state of New Jersey.
Lincoln won in every state he carried in 1860 except New Jersey, and also carried a state won four years earlier by Stephen Douglas (Missouri), one carried by John C. Breckinridge (Maryland) and all three newly admitted states (Kansas, Nevada and West Virginia).
Altogether, 212 electoral votes were counted in Congress for Lincoln - more than enough to win the presidency even if all of the states in rebellion had participated.
Lincoln was highly popular with soldiers and they in turn recommended him to their families back home.
The following states allowed soldiers to cast ballots: California, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin.
Out of the 40,247 army votes cast, Lincoln received 30,503 (75.8%) and McClellan 9,201 (22.9%), with the rest (543 votes) scattering (1.3%).
Only soldiers from Kentucky gave McClellan a majority of their votes, and he carried the army vote in the state by a vote of 2,823 (70.3%) to 1,194 (29.7%).
Of the 1,129 counties making returns, Lincoln won in 728 (64.48%), while McClellan carried 400 (35.43%).
One county (0.09%) in Iowa split evenly between Lincoln and McClellan.
This was the last election when the Republicans won Maryland until 1896.
