Calhoun County is a county in the U.S. state of Michigan.

The county seat is Marshall.
The county was established on October 19, 1829 and named after John C. Calhoun, who was at the time Vice President under Andrew Jackson, making it one of Michigan's Cabinet counties.
County government was first organized March 6, 1833.
Calhoun County comprises the Battle Creek, MI Metropolitan Statistical Area and is included in the Kalamazoo-Battle Creek-Portage, MI Combined Statistical Area.
========,2,History.
The Kalamazoo River oil spill occurred in July 2010 when a pipeline operated by Enbridge (Line 6B) burst and flowed into Talmadge Creek, a tributary of the Kalamazoo River.
A six-foot break in the pipeline resulted in the largest inland oil spill, and one of the costliest spills in U.S. history.
The pipeline carries diluted bitumen (dilbit), a heavy crude oil from Canada's Athabasca oil sands to the United States.
Following the spill, the volatile hydrocarbon diluents evaporated, leaving the heavier bitumen to sink in the water column.
Thirty-five miles of the Kalamazoo River were closed for clean-up until June 2012, when portions of the river were re-opened.
On March 14, 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ordered Enbridge to return to dredge portions of the river to remove submerged oil and oil-contaminated sediment.
