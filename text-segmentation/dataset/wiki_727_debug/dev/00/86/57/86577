========,1,preface.
In Gallo-Roman religion, Luxovios, Latinized as Luxovius was the god of the waters of Luxeuil, worshipped in Gaul.
He was a consort of Bricta.
The thermal spring sanctuary at Lexeuil produced evidence of the worship of other deities, including the sky-horseman who bears a solar wheel, and Sirona, another deity associated with healing springs.
========,2,Inscriptions.
Luxovius is recorded in the following two inscriptions, both from Luxeuil-les-Bains :
"To Lusso(v)ios and Bricta, Divixtius Constans freely and deservedly fulfilled his vow."
(CIL 13, 05425) "To Luxovios and Brixta, Gaius Julius Firmans freely and deservedly fulfilled his vow."
========,2,Etymology.
The name Luxovios implies light symbolism.
This may indicate that the god is a deity of both light, and of curative spring waters, two elements that were strong linked in the Celtic world.
