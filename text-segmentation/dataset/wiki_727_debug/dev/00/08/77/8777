========,1,preface.
A DNA virus is a virus that has DNA as its genetic material and replicates using a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase.
The nucleic acid is usually double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) but may also be single-stranded DNA (ssDNA).
DNA viruses belong to either "Group I" or "Group II" of the Baltimore classification system for viruses.
Single-stranded DNA is usually expanded to double-stranded in infected cells.
Although "Group VII" viruses such as hepatitis B contain a DNA genome, they are not considered DNA viruses according to the Baltimore classification, but rather reverse transcribing viruses because they replicate through an RNA intermediate.
Notable diseases like smallpox, herpes, and chickenpox are caused by such DNA viruses.
========,2,Group I: dsDNA viruses.
Genome organization within this group varies considerably.
Some have circular genomes ("Baculoviridae", "Papovaviridae" and "Polydnaviridae") while others have linear genomes ("Adenoviridae", "Herpesviridae" and some phages).
Some families have circularly permuted linear genomes (phage T4 and some "Iridoviridae").
Others have linear genomes with covalently closed ends ("Poxviridae" and "Phycodnaviridae").
A virus infecting archaea was first described in 1974.
Several others have been described since: most have head-tail morphologies and linear double-stranded DNA genomes.
Other morphologies have also been described: spindle shaped, rod shaped, filamentous, icosahedral and spherical.
Additional morphological types may exist.
Orders within this group are defined on the basis of morphology rather than DNA sequence similarity.
It is thought that morphology is more conserved in this group than sequence similarity or gene order which is extremely variable.
Three orders and 31 families are currently recognised.
A fourth order—Megavirales—for the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses has been proposed.
Four genera are recognised that have not yet been assigned a family.
Fifteen families are enveloped.
These include all three families in the order "Herpesvirales" and the following families: "Ascoviridae", "Ampullaviridae", "Asfarviridae", "Baculoviridae", "Fuselloviridae", "Globuloviridae", "Guttaviridae", "Hytrosaviridae", "Iridoviridae", "Lipothrixviridae", "Nimaviridae" and "Poxviridae".
Bacteriophages (viruses infecting bacteria) belonging to the families "Tectiviridae" and "Corticoviridae" have a lipid bilayer membrane inside the icosahedral protein capsid and the membrane surrounds the genome.
The crenarchaeal virus "Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus" has a similar structure.
The genomes in this group vary considerably from ~10 kilobases to over 2.5 megabases in length.
The largest bacteriophage known is Klebsiella Phage vB_KleM-RaK2 which has a genome of 346 kilobases.
A recently proposed clade is the Megavirales which includes the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses.
This proposal has yet to be ratified by the ICTV.
The virophages are a group of viruses that infect other viruses.
Their classification has yet to be decided.
A family Lavidaviridae has been proposed for the genera Mavirus and Sputnikvirus.
A virus with a novel method of genome packing infecting species of the genus "Sulfolobus" has been described.
As this virus does not resemble any known virus it seems likely that a new family will be created for it.
========,3,Host range.
Species of the order "Caudovirales" and of the families "Corticoviridae" and "Tectiviridae" infect bacteria.
Species of the order "Ligamenvirales" and the families "Ampullaviridae", "Bicaudaviridae", "Clavaviridae", "Fuselloviridae", "Globuloviridae", "Guttaviridae" and "Turriviridae" infect hyperthermophilic archaea species of the "Crenarchaeota".
Species of the order "Herpesvirales" and of the families "Adenoviridae", "Asfarviridae", "Iridoviridae", "Papillomaviridae", "Polyomaviridae" and "Poxviridae" infect vertebrates.
Species of the families "Ascovirus", "Baculovirus", "Hytrosaviridae", "Iridoviridae" and "Polydnaviruses" and of the genus "Nudivirus" infect insects.

These are the only known dsDNA viruses that infect plants.
Species of the family "Plasmaviridae" infect species of the class "Mollicutes".
Species of the family "Pandoraviridae" infect amoebae.
Species of the genus "Dinodnavirus" infect dinoflagellates.
These are the only known viruses that infect dinoflagellates.
Species of the genus "Rhizidiovirus" infect stramenopiles.
These are the only known dsDNA viruses that infect stramenopiles.
Species of the genus "Salterprovirus" and "Sphaerolipoviridae" infect species of the "Euryarchaeota".
========,2,Pleolipoviruses.
A group known as the pleolipoviruses, although having a similar genome organisation, differ in having either single or double stranded DNA genomes.
Within the double stranded forms have runs of single stranded DNA.
These viruses have been placed in the family "Pleolipoviridae".
This family has been divided in three genera: Alphapleolipovirus, Betapleolipovirus and Gammapleolipovirus.
These viruses are nonlytic and form virions characterized by a lipid vesicle enclosing the genome.
They do not have nucleoproteins.
The lipids in the viral membrane are unselectively acquired from host cell membranes.
The virions contain two to three major structural proteins, which either are embedded in the membrane or form spikes distributed randomly on the external membrane surface.
This group includes the following viruses:
***LIST***.
========,2,Group II: ssDNA viruses.
Although bacteriophages were first described in 1927, it was only in 1959 that Sinshemer working with phage Phi X 174 showed that they could possess single-stranded DNA genomes.
Despite this discovery until relatively recently it was believed that the majority of DNA viruses belonged to the double-stranded clade.
Recent work suggests that this may not be the case with single-stranded viruses forming the majority of viruses found in sea water, fresh water, sediment, terrestrial, extreme, metazoan-associated and marine microbial mats.
Many of these "environmental" viruses belong to the family Microviridae.
However, the vast majority has yet to be classified and assigned to genera and higher taxa.
Because most of these viruses do not appear to be related or are only distantly related to known viruses additional taxa will be created for these.
***LIST***.
Although ~50 archaeal viruses are known, all but two have double stranded genomes.
These two viruses have been placed in the families "Pleolipoviridae" and "Spiraviridae"
========,3,Taxonomy.
Families in this group have been assigned on the basis of the nature of the genome (circular or linear) and the host range.
Ten families are currently recognised.
***LIST***.
========,3,Classification.
A division of the circular single stranded viruses into four types has been proposed.
This division seems likely to reflect their phylogenetic relationships.
Type I genomes are characterized by a small circular DNA genome (approximately 2-kb), with the Rep protein and the major open reading frame (ORF) in opposite orientations.
This type is characteristic of the circoviruses, geminiviruses and nanoviruses.
Type II genomes have the unique feature of two separate Rep ORFs.
Type III genomes contain two major ORFs in the same orientation.
This arrangement is typical of the anelloviruses.
Type IV genomes have the largest genomes of nearly 4-kb, with up to eight ORFs.
This type of genome is found in the Inoviridae and the Microviridae.
Given the variety of single stranded viruses that have been described this scheme—if it is accepted by the ICTV—will need to be extended.
========,3,Host range.
The families "Bidnaviridae" and "Parvoviridae" have linear genomes while the other families have circular genomes.
The "Bidnaviridae" have a two part genome and infect invertebrates.
The "Inoviridae" and "Microviridae" infect bacteria; the "Anelloviridae" and "Circoviridae" infect animals (mammals and birds respectively); and the "Geminiviridae" and "Nanoviridae" infect plants.
In both the "Geminiviridae" and "Nanoviridae" the genome is composed of more than a single chromosome.
The "Bacillariodnaviridae" infect diatoms and have a unique genome: the major chromosome is circular (~6 kilobases in length): the minor chromosome is linear (~1 kilobase in length) and complementary to part of the major chromosome.
Members of the "Spiraviridae" infect archaea.
Members of the "Genomoviridae" infect fungi.
========,3,Molecular biology.
All viruses in this group require formation of a replicative form—a double stranded DNA intermediate—for genome replication.
This is normally created from the viral DNA with the assistance of the host's own DNA polymerase.
========,3,Recently classified viruses.
In the 9th edition of the viral taxonomy of the ICTV (published 2011) the Bombyx mori densovirus type 2 was placed in a new family—the "Bidnaviridae" on the basis of its genome structure and replication mechanism.
This is currently the only member of this family but it seems likely that other species will be allocated to this family in the near future.
A new genus — Bufavirus — was proposed on the basis of the isolation of two new viruses from human stool.
Another member of this genus—megabat bufavius 1—has been reported from bats.
The human viruses have since been renamed Primate protoparvovirus and been placed in the genus Protoparvovirus.
***LIST***.
The most recently introduced family of ssDNA viruses is the "Genomoviridae" (the family name is an acronym derived from "ge"minivirus-like, "no mo"vement protein).
The family includes 9 genera, namely "Gemycircularvirus", "Gemyduguivirus", "Gemygorvirus", "Gemykibivirus", "Gemykolovirus", "Gemykrogvirus", "Gemykroznavirus", "Gemytondvirus" and "Gemyvongvirus".
The genus name "Gemycircularvirus" stands for Gemini-like myco-infecting circular virus.
the type species of the genus "Gemycircularvirus" - Sclerotinia sclerotiorum hypovirulence associated DNA virus 1 - is currently the only cultivated member of the family.
The rest of genomoviruses are uncultivated and have been discovered using metagenomics techniques.

========,3,Unassigned species.
A number of additional single stranded DNA viruses have been described but are as yet unclassified.
***LIST***.
An unrelated group of ssDNA viruses, also discovered using viral metagenomics, includes the species bovine stool associated circular virus and chimpanzee stool associated circular virus.
The closest relations to this genus appear to be the "Nanoviridae" but further work will be needed to confirm this.
Another isolate that appears to be related to these viruses has been isolated from pig faeces in New Zealand.
This isolate also appears to be related to the pig stool-associated single-stranded DNA virus.
This virus has two large open reading frames one encoding the capsid gene and the other the Rep gene.
These are bidirectionally transcribed and separated by intergenic regions.
Another virus of this group has been reported again from pigs.
A virus from this group has been isolated from turkey faeces.

It appears to be related to the fur seal virus.
Two viruses have been isolated from human faeces — circo-like virus Brazil hs1 and hs2 — with genome lengths of 2526 and 2533 nucleotides respectively.
These viruses have four open reading frames.
These viruses appear to be related to three viruses previously isolated from waste water, a bat and from a rodent.
This appears to belong to a novel group.
Two viruses have been described from the nesting material yellow crowned parakeet ("Cyanoramphus auriceps") — Cyanoramphus nest-associated circular X virus (2308 nt) and Cyanoramphus nest-associated circular K virus (2087 nt) Both viruses have two bidirectional open reading frames.
Within these are the rolling-circle replication motifs I, II, III and the helicase motifs Walker A and Walker B.
There is also a conserved nonanucleotide motif required for rolling-circle replication.
CynNCKV has some similarity to the picobiliphyte nano-like virus (Picobiliphyte M5584-5) and CynNCXV has some similarity to the rodent stool associated virus (RodSCV M-45).
A virus with a circular genome — sea turtle tornovirus 1 — has been isolated from a sea turtle with fibropapillomatosis.
It is sufficiently unrelated to any other known virus that it may belong to a new family.
The closest relations seem to be the "Gyrovirinae".
The proposed genus name for this virus is Tornovirus.
***LIST***.
Among these are the parvovirus-like viruses.
These have linear single-stranded DNA genomes but unlike the parvoviruses the genome is bipartate.
This group includes Hepatopancreatic parvo-like virus and Lymphoidal parvo-like virus.
A new family Bidensoviridae has been proposed for this group but this proposal has not been ratified by the ICTV to date.
Their closest relations appear to be the "Brevidensoviruses" (family Parvoviridae).
A virus — Acheta domesticus volvovirus - has been isolated from the house cricket ("Acheta domesticus").
The genome is circular, has four open reading frames and is 2,517 nucleotides in length.
It appears to be unrelated to previously described species.
The genus name Volvovirus has been proposed for these species.
The genomes in this genus are ~2.5 nucleotides in length and encode 4 open reading frames.

A virus has been isolated from the mud flat snail ("Amphibola crenata").
This virus has a single stranded circular genome of 2351 nucleotides that encoded 2 open reading frames that are oriented in opposite directions.
The smaller open reading frame (874 nucleotides) encodes a protein with similarities to the "Rep" (replication) proteins of circoviruses and plasmids.
The larger open reading frame (955 nucleotides) has no homology to any currently known protein.
An unusual — and as yet unnamed — virus has been isolated from the flatwom "Girardia tigrina".
Because of its genome organisation, this virus appears to belong to an entirely new family.

Several viruses — baminivirus, nepavirus and niminivirus — related to geminvirus have also been reported.
A virus - Ancient caribou feces associated virus - has been cloned from 700-y-old caribou faeces.
***LIST***.
More than 600 single-stranded DNA viral genomes were identified in ssDNA purified from seawater .
These fell into 129 genetically distinct groups that had no recognizable similarity to each other or to other virus sequences, and thus many likely represent new families of viruses.
Of the 129 groups, eleven were much more abundant than the others, and although their hosts have yet to be identified, they are likely to be eukaryotic phytoplankton, zooplankton and bacteria.
A virus — Boiling Springs Lake virus — appears to have evolved by a recombination event between a DNA virus (circovirus) and an RNA virus (tombusvirus).
The genome is circular and encodes two proteins—a Rep protein and a capsid protein.
Further reports of viruses that appear to have evolved from recombination events between ssRNA and ssDNA viruses have been made.
A new virus has been isolated from the diatom "Chaetoceros setoensis".
It has a single stranded DNA genome and does not appear to be a member of any previously described group.
========,2,Satellite viruses.
Satellite viruses are small viruses with either RNA or DNA as their genomic material that require another virus to replicate.
There are two types of DNA satellite viruses—the alphasatellites and the betasatellites—both of which are dependent on begomoviruses.
At present satellite viruses are not classified into genera or higher taxa.
Alphasatellites are small circular single strand DNA viruses that require a begomovirus for transmission.
Betasatellites are small linear single stranded DNA viruses that require a begomovirus to replicate.
========,2,Phylogenetic relationships.
========,3,Introduction.
Phylogenetic relationships between these families are difficult to determine.
The genomes differ significantly in size and organisation.
Most studies that have attempted to determine these relationships are based either on some of the more conserved proteins—DNA polymerase and others—or on common structural features.
In general most of the proposed relationships are tentative and have not yet been used by the ICTV in their classification.
========,3,ss DNA viruses.
The evolutionary history of this group is currently poorly understood.
An ancient origin for the single stranded circular DNA viruses has been proposed.
Capsid proteins of most icosahedral ssRNA and ssDNA viruses display the same structural fold, the eight-stranded beta-barrel, also known as the jelly-roll fold.
On the other hand, the replication proteins of icosahedral ssDNA viruses belong to the superfamily of rolling-circle replication initiation proteins that are commonly found in prokaryotic plasmids.
Based on these observations, it has been proposed that small DNA viruses have originated via recombination between RNA viruses and plasmids.
Circoviruses may have evolved from a nanovirus.
Given the similarities between the "rep" proteins of the alphasatellites and the nanoviruses, it is likely that the alphasatellites evolved from the nanoviruses.
Further work in this area is needed to clarify this.
The geminiviruses may have evolved from phytoplasmal plasmids.
Based on the three-dimensional structure of the Rep proteins the geminiviruses and parvoviruses may be related.
The ancestor of the geminiviruses probably infected dicots.
The parvoviruses have frequently invaded the germ lines of diverse animal species including mammals, fishes, birds, tunicates, arthropods and flatworms.
In particular they have been associated with the human genome for ~98 million years.
Members of the family Bidnaviridae have evolved from insect parvoviruses by replacing the typical replication-initiation endonuclease with a protein-primed family B DNA polymerase acquired from large DNA transposons of the Polinton/Maverick family.
Some bidnavirus genes were also horizontally acquired from reoviruses (dsRNA genomes) and baculoviruses (dsDNA genomes).
The Genomoviridae and the Geminividiae appear to be related.
The Bidnaviridae appear to have evolved from the Parvoviridae.
========,2,Bacteriophage evolution.
Since 1959 ~6300 prokaryote viruses have been described morphologically, including ~6200 bacterial and ~100 archaeal viruses.
Archaeal viruses belong to 15 families and infect members of 16 archaeal genera.
These are nearly exclusively hyperthermophiles or extreme halophiles.
Tailed archaeal viruses are found only in the Euryarchaeota, whereas most filamentous and pleomorphic archaeal viruses occur in the Crenarchaeota.
Bacterial viruses belong to 10 families and infect members of 179 bacterial genera: most these are members of the Firmicutes and γ-proteobacteria.
The vast majority (96.3%) are tailed with and only 230 (3.7%) are polyhedral, filamentous or pleomorphic.
The family Siphoviridae is the largest family (>3600 descriptions: 57.3%).
The tailed phages appear to be monophyletic and are the oldest known virus group.
They arose repeatedly in different hosts and there are at least 11 separate lines of descent.
All of the known temperate phages employ one of only three different systems for their lysogenic cycle: lambda-like integration/excision, Mu-like transposition or the plasmid-like partitioning of phage N15.
A putative course of evolution of these phages has been proposed by Ackermann.
Tailed phages originated in the early Precambrian, long before eukaryotes and their viruses.
The ancestral tailed phage had an icosahedral head of about 60 nanometers in diameter and a long non contractile tail with sixfold symmetry.
The capsid contained a single molecule of double stranded DNA of about 50 kilobases.
The tail was probably provided with a fixation apparatus.
The head and tail were held together by a connector.
The viral particle contained no lipids, was heavier than its descendant viruses and had a high DNA content proportional to its capsid size (~50%).
Most of the genome coded for structural proteins.
Morphopoietic genes clustered at one end of the genome, with head genes preceding tail genes.
Lytic enzymes were probably coded for.
Part of the phage genome was nonessential and possibly bacterial.
The virus infected its host from the outside and injected its DNA.
Replication involved transcription in several waves and formation of DNA concatemers.
New phages were released by burst of the infected cell after lysis of host membranes by a peptidoglycan hydrolase.
Capsids were assembled from a starting point, the connector and around a scaffold.
They underwent an elaborate maturation process involving protein cleavage and capsid expansion.
Heads and tails were assembled separately and joined later.
The DNA was cut to size and entered preformed capsids by a headful mechanism.
Subsequently, the phages evolved contractile or short tails and elongated heads.
Some viruses become temperate by acquiring an integrase-excisionase complex, plasmid parts or transposons.
========,2,NCLDVs.
The asfarviruses, iridoviruses, mimiviruses, phycodnaviruses and poxviruses have been shown to belong to a single group,—the large nuclear and cytoplasmic DNA viruses.
These are also abbreviated "NCLDV".
This clade can be divided into two groups:
***LIST***.
It is probable that these viruses evolved before the separation of eukaryoyes into the extant crown groups.
The ancestral genome was complex with at least 41 genes including (1) the replication machinery (2) up to four RNA polymerase subunits (3) at least three transcription factors (4) capping and polyadenylation enzymes (5) the DNA packaging apparatus (6) and structural components of an icosahedral capsid and the viral membrane.
The evolution of this group of viruses appears to be complex with genes having been gained from multiple sources.
It has been proposed that the ancestor of NCLDVs has evolved from large, virus-like DNA transposons of the Polinton/Maverick family.
From Polinton/Maverick transposons NCLDVs might have inherited the key components required for virion morphogenesis, including the major and minor capsid proteins, maturation protease and genome packaging ATPase.
Another group of large viruses—the Pandoraviridae—has been described.
Two species—Pandoravirus salinus and Pandoravirus dulcis—have been recognized.
These were isolated from Chile and Australia respectively.
These viruses are about one micrometer in diameter making them one of the largest viruses discovered so far.
Their gene complement is larger than any other known virus to date.
At present they appear to be unrelated to any other species of virus.
An even larger genus, Pithovirus, has since been discovered, measuring about 1.5 µm in length.
Another virus - Cedratvirus - may be related this group.
