========,2,Geography.
Aubusson is situated in the southern part of the "département", at the confluence of the Creuse River and the Beauze.
The route nationale N141 goes through the town.
========,2,History.
Local lore previously held that the community was settled by defeated Berbers following the 8th-century Battle of Tours, but it is now established that Aubusson has existed at least since the Gallo-Roman period.
The Camp des Châtres, within the town’s boundaries, for a long time considered a Roman fort, actually dates back a little further, to the Iron Age.
The town was known as "Albuciensis" in 936 and under the name " Albuconis" in 1070.
The name possibly originates from a name of a man, Albucius Other scholars claim the name is from a Celtic word meaning " craggy".
In the Middle Ages the town was ruled by viscounts.
The vicecomital family also produced a troubadour named Joan d'Aubusson.
========,2,Tapestry.
Aubusson is well known for its tapestry and carpets, which have been famous throughout the world since the 14th century.
Its origins were born with the arrival of weavers from Flanders, who took refuge in Aubusson around 1580.
There is a famous collection of Aubusson tapestries at Vallon-Pont-d'Arc.
The style of the tapestries produced has changed through the centuries, from scenes of green landscapes through to hunting scenes.
In the 17th Century, the Aubusson and Felletin workshops were given "Royal Appointment" status.
A downturn in fortunes came after the French revolution and the arrival of wallpaper.
However, tapestry made something of a comeback during the 1930s, with artists such as Cocteau, Dufy, Dali, Braque, Calder and Picasso being invited to Aubusson to express themselves through the medium of wool.
Aubusson tapestry still thrives today, preserving a range of traditional skills.
In 1983, l’Atelier Raymond Picaud chose Burhan Doğançay's Ribbon Series as a tapestry subject.
Coventry cathedral's famous Christ in Glory tapestry, designed by artist Graham Sutherland, was woven in nearby Felletin.
Installed in 1962, this was the world's largest vertical tapestry up until the 1990s.
