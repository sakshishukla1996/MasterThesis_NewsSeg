========,1,preface.
Ixtab or Ix Tab (Mayan pronunciation: [iʃˈtaɓ]) is the Yucatec Mayan goddess of suicide.
Her name translates to “Woman Rope”.
She is also referred to as the “Hanging Woman” and is often associated with IxTaby and Xkeban.
========,2,Iconography.
Ixtab is depicted as a woman with decomposing flesh, closed eyes and hanging from a rope tie to a tree.
The black circle on her face represents the decomposing flesh and the tree refers to Yanxcha, the Mayan holy tree, also called the World Tree.
No other photos of Ixtab are known to exist.
========,2,Goddess.
Under certain circumstances in the Yucatan region of Mexico, suicide by hanging was considered an honorable way to die if hung on the Yanxcha tree.
People who died this way were believed to travel straight to paradise, This could explain why the Yucatan region has the highest hanging suicide rate in the world.
Ixtab would accompany these souls to their final resting place in paradise (thus playing the role of a psychopomp).
Here, they would be joined by slain soldiers, sacrificial victims, women who had died in childbirth and members of the priesthood.
These individuals would enjoy the afterlife and would be rewarded with delicious food, drink and rest under the shade of the world tree.
========,2,Nature and fertility.
Ixtab is the divine feminine, which contrasts most of the other masculine Mayan gods.
As she is considered a mother form, people, especially women, turn to her in times of need.
She is linked to female fertility.
It is believed that the lunar and solar eclipses were connected to the dates of when someone committed suicide.
Pregnant women considered lunar eclipse a predictor of dire consequences, like risks of deformation and death for unborn children.
========,2,Doubts of her existence.
Scholars have debated the legitimacy of Ixtab as a Mayan goddess.
Recent studies of Diego de Landa’s "Relacion de las cosas de Yucatan" by Beatriz Reyes-Foster cast doubt on her existence.
Reyes-Foster found no text or iconographic evidence for the existence of a Mayan god or goddess of suicide.
It is hypothesized that Ixtab arose from interpretations of a story rooted in archaeological and ethnohistorical evidence popularized for tourist attractions and local legends.
Her story persisted because of heritage.
The Mayan civilization is reconstructed from artifacts found from the pre-Columbian times rather than recent evidence, which is why her legend has persisted without strong supporting evidence.
