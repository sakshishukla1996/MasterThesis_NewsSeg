========,2,Politics.
Whereas most of West Virginia has become a Republican bastion in the twenty-first century after having leaned heavily Democratic between the New Deal and Bill Clinton, Grant County has always been among the most rock-ribbed Republican counties in the country.
Since Grant County was created in 1866, no Democrat has managed to receive even forty percent of the county’s vote in any Presidential election, and only Lyndon Johnson in 1964 and Jimmy Carter in 1976 ever received over thirty percent.
The only Republican to ever lose Grant County has been William Howard Taft in 1912 when the Republican Party was divided and Progressive Theodore Roosevelt claimed the majority of the county’s vote.
